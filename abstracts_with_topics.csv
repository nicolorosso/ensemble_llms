climate change,"Although numerous species distribution models have been developed, most were based on insufficient distribution data or used older climate change scenarios. We aimed to quantify changes in projected ranges and threat level by the years 2061–2080, for 12 European forest tree species under three climate change scenarios. We combined tree distribution data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, EUFORGEN, and forest inventories, and we developed species distribution models using MaxEnt and 19 bioclimatic variables. Models were developed for three climate change scenarios—optimistic (RCP2.6), moderate (RCP4.5), and pessimistic (RPC8.5)—using three General Circulation Models, for the period 2061–2080. Our study revealed different responses of tree species to projected climate change. The species may be divided into three groups: “winners”—mostly late‐successional species: Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur, and Quercus petraea; “losers”—mostly pioneer species: Betula pendula, Larix decidua, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris; and alien species—Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus rubra, and Robinia pseudoacacia, which may be also considered as “winners.” Assuming limited migration, most of the species studied would face a significant decrease in suitable habitat area. The threat level was highest for species that currently have the northernmost distribution centers. Ecological consequences of the projected range contractions would be serious for both forest management and nature conservation."
climate change,"The varied effects of recent extreme weather events around the world exemplify the uneven impacts of climate change on populations, even within relatively small geographic regions. Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts."
climate change,"Recent research has strengthened the understanding of the links between climate and tropical cyclones (TCs) on various timescales. Geological records of past climates have shown century‐long variations in TC numbers. While no significant trends have been identified in the Atlantic since the late 19th century, significant observed trends in TC numbers and intensities have occurred in this basin over the past few decades, and trends in other basins are increasingly being identified. However, understanding of the causes of these trends is incomplete, and confidence in these trends continues to be hampered by a lack of consistent observations in some basins. A theoretical basis for maximum TC intensity appears now to be well established, but a climate theory of TC formation remains elusive. Climate models mostly continue to predict future decreases in global TC numbers, projected increases in the intensities of the strongest storms and increased rainfall rates. Sea level rise will likely contribute toward increased storm surge risk. Against the background of global climate change and sea level rise, it is important to carry out quantitative assessments on the potential risk of TC‐induced storm surge and flooding to densely populated cities and river deltas. Several climate models are now able to generate a good distribution of both TC numbers and intensities in the current climate. Inconsistent TC projection results emerge from modeling studies due to different downscaling methodologies and warming scenarios, inconsistencies in projected changes of large‐scale conditions, and differences in model physics and tracking algorithms.

climate change,"There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1°C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: 'it never rains but it pours!' This increases the risk of flooding. The atmo- spheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the 'rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. This pattern is simulated by climate mod- els and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. 'more bang for the buck', atmo- spheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Nino a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture."
climate change,"This article reviews the economic impacts of climate change and the policy implications of the results. Current estimates indicate that climate change will likely have a limited impact on the economy and human welfare in the twenty-first century. In fact, the initial impacts of climate change may well be positive. However, in the long run the negative impacts dominate the positive ones. Negative impacts will be substantially greater in poorer, hotter, and lower-lying countries. Poverty reduction complements greenhouse gas emissions reduction as a means to reduce climate change impacts. Although climate change may affect the growth rate of the global economy and may trap more people in poverty, quantification of these impacts remains difficult. The optimal carbon tax in the near term is somewhere between a few tens and a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon."
climate change,"The Protocol shares the objective and institutions of the Convention. The major distinction between the two, however, is that while the Convention encouraged industrialized countries to stabilize GHG emissions, the Protocol commits them to do so. The detailed rules for its implementation were adopted at COP 7 in Marrakesh in 2001, and are called the "" Marrakesh Accords. "" The Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of "" common but differentiated responsibilities. "" The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005. 192 Parties have ratified the treaty to date. Under the Protocol, 37 industrialized countries and the European Community have committed to reducing their emissions by an average of 5 percent against 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008-2012. For this group of countries, reductions of 11% are projected for the first Kyoto commitment period from 2008 to 2012, provided policies and measures planned by these countries are put in place (see Annex). These countries will also have to make use of the Protocol's "" flexible mechanisms "" in order to reach their collective emission reduction goal. Flexibility in meeting targets Emission targets for industrialized country Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are expressed as levels of allowed emissions, or "" assigned amounts "" , over the 2008-2012 commitment period. Such assigned amounts are denominated in tonnes (of CO2 equivalent emissions). Industrialized countries must first and foremost take domestic action against climate change, but the Protocol allows them a certain degree of flexibility in meeting their emission reduction commitments through three innovative market-based mechanisms. The Kyoto Mechanisms The three Kyoto mechanisms are: Emissions Trading – known as "" the carbon market "" – the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI). The carbon market spawned by these mechanisms is a key tool in reducing emissions worldwide. It was worth 30 billion USD in 2006 and is set to increase. JI and CDM are the two project-based mechanisms which feed the carbon market. JI enables industrialized countries to carry out joint implementation projects with other developed countries (usually countries with economies in transition), while the CDM involves investment in sustainable development projects that reduce emissions in developing countries. Since the beginning of 2006, the estimated potential of emission reductions to be"
climate change,"Costing out the effects of climate change Episodes of severe weather in the United States, such as the present abundance of rainfall in California, are brandished as tangible evidence of the future costs of current climate trends. Hsiang et al. collected national data documenting the responses in six economic sectors to short-term weather fluctuations. These data were integrated with probabilistic distributions from a set of global climate models and used to estimate future costs during the remainder of this century across a range of scenarios (see the Perspective by Pizer). In terms of overall effects on gross domestic product, the authors predict negative impacts in the southern United States and positive impacts in some parts of the Pacific Northwest and New England. Science, this issue p. 1362; see also p. 1330 One percent of gross domestic product per degree Celsius is a steep price to pay for climate change. Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5)."
climate change,"Indigenous and allied scholars, knowledge keepers, scientists, learners, change-makers, and leaders are creating a field to support Indigenous peoples’ capacities to address anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. Provisionally, I call it Indigenous climate change studies (Indigenous studies, for short, in this essay). The studies involve many types of work, including Indigenous climate resiliency plans, such as the Salish-Kootenai Tribe’s Climate Change Strategic Plan that includes sections on “Culture” and “Tribal Elder Observations,” policy documents, such as the Inuit Petition expressing “the right to be cold,” conferences, such as “Climate Changed: Reflections on Our Past, Present and Future Situation,” organized by the Indigenous Peoples Climate Change Working Group, and numerous declarations and academic papers, from the Mandaluyong Declaration of the Global Conference on Indigenous Women, Climate Change and REDD to a special issue of the scientific journal Climatic Change devoted to Indigenous peoples in the U.S. context."
climate change,"Effectively addressing climate change requires significant changes in individual and collective human behavior and decision‐making. Yet, in light of the increasing politicization of (climate) science, and the attempts of vested‐interest groups to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change through organized “disinformation campaigns,” identifying ways to effectively engage with the public about the issue across the political spectrum has proven difficult. A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the politicization of science is to convey the high level of normative agreement (“consensus”) among experts about the reality of human‐caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change. The current research bridges this divide by exploring how people evaluate and process consensus cues in a polarized information environment. Furthermore, evidence is provided that it is possible to pre‐emptively protect (“inoculate”) public attitudes about climate change against real‐world misinformation."
climate change,"BACKGROUND As global climate change accelerates, one of the most urgent tasks for the coming decades is to develop accurate predictions about biological responses to guide the effective protection of biodiversity. Predictive models in biology provide a means for scientists to project changes to species and ecosystems in response to disturbances such as climate change. Most current predictive models, however, exclude important biological mechanisms such as demography, dispersal, evolution, and species interactions. These biological mechanisms have been shown to be important in mediating past and present responses to climate change. Thus, current modeling efforts do not provide sufficiently accurate predictions. Despite the many complexities involved, biologists are rapidly developing tools that include the key biological processes needed to improve predictive accuracy. The biggest obstacle to applying these more realistic models is that the data needed to inform them are almost always missing. We suggest ways to fill this growing gap between model sophistication and information to predict and prevent the most damaging aspects of climate change for life on Earth. ADVANCES On the basis of empirical and theoretical evidence, we identify six biological mechanisms that commonly shape responses to climate change yet are too often missing from current predictive models: physiology; demography, life history, and phenology; species interactions; evolutionary potential and population differentiation; dispersal, colonization, and range dynamics; and responses to environmental variation. We prioritize the types of information needed to inform each of these mechanisms and suggest proxies for data that are missing or difficult to collect. We show that even for well-studied species, we often lack critical information that would be necessary to apply more realistic, mechanistic models. Consequently, data limitations likely override the potential gains in accuracy of more realistic models. Given the enormous challenge of collecting this detailed information on millions of species around the world, we highlight practical methods that promote the greatest gains in predictive accuracy. Trait-based approaches leverage sparse data to make more general inferences about unstudied species. Targeting species with high climate sensitivity and disproportionate ecological impact can yield important insights about future ecosystem change. Adaptive modeling schemes provide a means to target the most important data while simultaneously improving predictive accuracy. OUTLOOK Strategic collections of essential biological information will allow us to build generalizable insights that inform our broader ability to anticipate species’ responses to climate change and other human-caused disturbances. By increasing accuracy and making uncertainties explicit, scientists can deliver improved projections for biodiversity under climate change together with characterizations of uncertainty to support more informed decisions by policymakers and land managers. Toward this end, a globally coordinated effort to fill data gaps in advance of the growing climate-fueled biodiversity crisis offers substantial advantages in efficiency, coverage, and accuracy. Biologists can take advantage of the lessons learned from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s development, coordination, and integration of climate change projections. Climate and weather projections were greatly improved by incorporating important mechanisms and testing predictions against global weather station data. Biology can do the same. We need to adopt this meteorological approach to predicting biological responses to climate change to enhance our ability to mitigate future changes to global biodiversity and the services it provides to humans. Emerging models are beginning to incorporate six key biological mechanisms that can improve predictions of biological responses to climate change. Models that include biological mechanisms have been used to project (clockwise from top) the evolution of disease-harboring mosquitoes, future environments and land use, physiological responses of invasive species such as cane toads, demographic responses of penguins to future climates, climate-dependent dispersal behavior in butterflies, and mismatched interactions between butterflies and their host plants. Despite these modeling advances, we seldom have the detailed data needed to build these models, necessitating new efforts to collect the relevant data to parameterize more biologically realistic predictive models. New biological models are incorporating the realistic processes underlying biological responses to climate change and other human-caused disturbances. However, these more realistic models require detailed information, which is lacking for most species on Earth. Current monitoring efforts mainly document changes in biodiversity, rather than collecting the mechanistic data needed to predict future changes. We describe and prioritize the biological information needed to inform more realistic projections of species’ responses to climate change. We also highlight how trait-based approaches and adaptive modeling can leverage sparse data to make broader predictions. We outline a global effort to collect the data necessary to better understand, anticipate, and reduce the damaging effects of climate change on biodiversity."

climate change,"Climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security."
climate change,"In marine ecosystems, rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change are associated with concurrent shifts in temperature, circulation, stratification, nutrient input, oxygen content, and ocean acidification, with potentially wide-ranging biological effects. Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend."

climate change,"Significance The food system is responsible for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions while unhealthy diets and high body weight are among the greatest contributors to premature mortality. Our study provides a comparative analysis of the health and climate change benefits of global dietary changes for all major world regions. We project that health and climate change benefits will both be greater the lower the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Three quarters of all benefits occur in developing countries although the per capita impacts of dietary change would be greatest in developed countries. The monetized value of health improvements could be comparable with, and possibly larger than, the environmental benefits of the avoided damages from climate change. What we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environment we all share. Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6–10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1–31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4–13% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here."

climate change,"Gas hydrate, a frozen, naturally‐occurring, and highly‐concentrated form of methane, sequesters significant carbon in the global system and is stable only over a range of low‐temperature and moderate‐pressure conditions. Gas hydrate is widespread in the sediments of marine continental margins and permafrost areas, locations where ocean and atmospheric warming may perturb the hydrate stability field and lead to release of the sequestered methane into the overlying sediments and soils. Methane and methane‐derived carbon that escape from sediments and soils and reach the atmosphere could exacerbate greenhouse warming. The synergy between warming climate and gas hydrate dissociation feeds a popular perception that global warming could drive catastrophic methane releases from the contemporary gas hydrate reservoir. Appropriate evaluation of the two sides of the climate‐methane hydrate synergy requires assessing direct and indirect observational data related to gas hydrate dissociation phenomena and numerical models that track the interaction of gas hydrates/methane with the ocean and/or atmosphere. Methane hydrate is likely undergoing dissociation now on global upper continental slopes and on continental shelves that ring the Arctic Ocean. Many factors—the depth of the gas hydrates in sediments, strong sediment and water column sinks, and the inability of bubbles emitted at the seafloor to deliver methane to the sea‐air interface in most cases—mitigate the impact of gas hydrate dissociation on atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations though. There is no conclusive proof that hydrate‐derived methane is reaching the atmosphere now, but more observational data and improved numerical models will better characterize the climate‐hydrate synergy in the future."
climate change,"Accumulating impacts Anthropogenic climate change is now in full swing, our global average temperature already having increased by 1°C from preindustrial levels. Many studies have documented individual impacts of the changing climate that are particular to species or regions, but individual impacts are accumulating and being amplified more broadly. Scheffers et al. review the set of impacts that have been observed across genes, species, and ecosystems to reveal a world already undergoing substantial change. Understanding the causes, consequences, and potential mitigation of these changes will be essential as we move forward into a warming world. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaf7671 BACKGROUND Climate change impacts have now been documented across every ecosystem on Earth, despite an average warming of only ~1°C so far. Here, we describe the full range and scale of climate change effects on global biodiversity that have been observed in natural systems. To do this, we identify a set of core ecological processes (32 in terrestrial and 31 each in marine and freshwater ecosystems) that underpin ecosystem functioning and support services to people. Of the 94 processes considered, 82% show evidence of impact from climate change in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples of observed impacts from meta-analyses and case studies go beyond well-established shifts in species ranges and changes to phenology and population dynamics to include disruptions that scale from the gene to the ecosystem. ADVANCES Species are undergoing evolutionary adaptation to temperature extremes, and climate change has substantial impacts on species physiology that include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex ratios in species with temperature-dependent sex determination, and increased metabolic costs of living in a warmer world. These physiological adjustments have observable impacts on morphology, with many species in both aquatic and terrestrial systems shrinking in body size because large surface-to-volume ratios are generally favored under warmer conditions. Other morphological changes include reductions in melanism to improve thermoregulation, and altered wing and bill length in birds. Broader-scale responses to climate change include changes in the phenology, abundance, and distribution of species. Temperate plants are budding and flowering earlier in spring and later in autumn. Comparable adjustments have been observed in marine and freshwater fish spawning events and in the timing of seasonal migrations of animals worldwide. Changes in the abundance and age structure of populations have also been observed, with widespread evidence of range expansion in warm-adapted species and range contraction in cold-adapted species. As a by-product of species redistributions, novel community interactions have emerged. Tropical and boreal species are increasingly incorporated into temperate and polar communities, respectively, and when possible, lowland species are increasingly assimilating into mountain communities. Multiplicative impacts from gene to community levels scale up to produce ecological regime shifts, in which one ecosystem state shifts to an alternative state. OUTLOOK The many observed impacts of climate change at different levels of biological organization point toward an increasingly unpredictable future for humans. Reduced genetic diversity in crops, inconsistent crop yields, decreased productivity in fisheries from reduced body size, and decreased fruit yields from fewer winter chill events threaten food security. Changes in the distribution of disease vectors alongside the emergence of novel pathogens and pests are a direct threat to human health as well as to crops, timber, and livestock resources. Humanity depends on intact, functioning ecosystems for a range of goods and services. Enhanced understanding of the observed impacts of climate change on core ecological processes is an essential first step to adapting to them and mitigating their influence on biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Climate change impacts on ecological processes in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. Impacts can be measured on multiple processes at different levels of biological organization within ecosystems. In total, 82% of 94 ecological processes show evidence of being affected by climate change. Within levels of organization, the percentage of processes impacted varies from 60% for genetics to 100% for species distribution. Most ecological processes now show responses to anthropogenic climate change. In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems."
climate change,"Abstract Counties more likely to be affected by climate change pay more in underwriting fees and initial yields to issue long-term municipal bonds compared to counties unlikely to be affected by climate change. This difference disappears when comparing short-term municipal bonds, implying the market prices climate change risks for long-term securities only. Higher issuance costs for climate risk counties are driven by bonds with lower credit ratings. Investor attention is a driving factor, as the difference in issuance costs on bonds issued by climate and nonclimate affected counties increases after the release of the 2006 Stern Review on climate change."
climate change,"Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them. The last three decades have seen exponential growth in the number of studies evaluating how, how much, why, when, and where species will be impacted by climate change. We provide an overview of the rapidly developing field of climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) and describe key concepts, terms, steps and considerations. We stress the importance of identifying the full range of pressures, impacts and their associated mechanisms that species face and using this as a basis for selecting the appropriate assessment approaches for quantifying vulnerability. We outline four CCVA assessment approaches, namely trait‐based, correlative, mechanistic and combined approaches and discuss their use. Since any assessment can deliver unreliable or even misleading results when incorrect data and parameters are applied, we discuss finding, selecting, and applying input data and provide examples of open‐access resources. Because rare, small‐range, and declining‐range species are often of particular conservation concern while also posing significant challenges for CCVA, we describe alternative ways to assess them. We also describe how CCVAs can be used to inform IUCN Red List assessments of extinction risk. Finally, we suggest future directions in this field and propose areas where research efforts may be particularly valuable."
climate change,"We show that the distributions of both exploited and nonexploited North Sea fishes have responded markedly to recent increases in sea temperature, with nearly two-thirds of species shifting in mean latitude or depth or both over 25 years. For species with northerly or southerly range margins in the North Sea, half have shown boundary shifts with warming, and all but one shifted northward. Species with shifting distributions have faster life cycles and smaller body sizes than nonshifting species. Further temperature rises are likely to have profound impacts on commercial fisheries through continued shifts in distribution and alterations in community interactions."
climate change,"Abstract Future changes in climate pose significant challenges for society, not the least of which is how best to adapt to observed and potential future impacts of these changes to which the world is already committed. Adaptation is a dynamic social process: the ability of societies to adapt is determined, in part, by the ability to act collectively. This article reviews emerging perspectives on collective action and social capital and argues that insights from these areas inform the nature of adaptive capacity and normative prescriptions of policies of adaptation. Specifically, social capital is increasingly understood within economics to have public and private elements, both of which are based on trust, reputation, and reciprocal action. The public-good aspects of particular forms of social capital are pertinent elements of adaptive capacity in interacting with natural capital and in relation to the performance of institutions that cope with the risks of changes in climate. Case studies are presented of present-day collective action for coping with extremes in weather in coastal areas in Southeast Asia and of community-based coastal management in the Caribbean. These cases demonstrate the importance of social capital framing both the public and private institutions of resource management that build resilience in the face of the risks of changes in climate. These cases illustrate, by analogy, the nature of adaptation processes and collective action in adapting to future changes in climate."
climate change,"Most of the planet's diversity is concentrated in the tropics, which includes many regions undergoing rapid climate change. Yet, while climate‐induced biodiversity changes are widely documented elsewhere, few studies have addressed this issue for lowland tropical ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the floristic and functional composition of intact lowland Amazonian forests have been changing by evaluating records from 106 long‐term inventory plots spanning 30 years. We analyse three traits that have been hypothesized to respond to different environmental drivers (increase in moisture stress and atmospheric CO2 concentrations): maximum tree size, biogeographic water‐deficit affiliation and wood density. Tree communities have become increasingly dominated by large‐statured taxa, but to date there has been no detectable change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at the community level, despite most forest plots having experienced an intensification of the dry season. However, among newly recruited trees, dry‐affiliated genera have become more abundant, while the mortality of wet‐affiliated genera has increased in those plots where the dry season has intensified most. Thus, a slow shift to a more dry‐affiliated Amazonia is underway, with changes in compositional dynamics (recruits and mortality) consistent with climate‐change drivers, but yet to significantly impact whole‐community composition. The Amazon observational record suggests that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is driving a shift within tree communities to large‐statured species and that climate changes to date will impact forest composition, but long generation times of tropical trees mean that biodiversity change is lagging behind climate change."
climate change,"Marine ecosystems are centrally important to the biology of the planet, yet a comprehensive understanding of how anthropogenic climate change is affecting them has been poorly developed. Recent studies indicate that rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of years, with an associated risk of fundamental and irreversible ecological transformation. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries."

climate change,"The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450–600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the “dust bowl” era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4–1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6–1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer."
climate change,"In this short and deliberately provocative paper I reflect on what seems to be a yawning gulf between the potential contribution of the social sciences and the typically restricted models and concepts of social change embedded in contemporary environmental policy in the UK, and in other countries too. As well as making a strong case for going beyond what I refer to as the dominant paradigm of ‘ABC’—attitude, behaviour, and choice—I discuss the attractions of this model, the blind spots it creates, and the forms of governance it sustains. This exercise provides some insight into why so much relevant social theory remains so marginalised, and helps identify opportunities for making better use of existing intellectual resources."
climate change,"Wheat grain protein concentration is an important determinant of wheat quality for human nutrition that is often overlooked in efforts to improve crop production. We tested and applied a 32‐multi‐model ensemble to simulate global wheat yield and quality in a changing climate. Potential benefits of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2050 on global wheat grain and protein yield are likely to be negated by impacts from rising temperature and changes in rainfall, but with considerable disparities between regions. Grain and protein yields are expected to be lower and more variable in most low‐rainfall regions, with nitrogen availability limiting growth stimulus from elevated CO2. Introducing genotypes adapted to warmer temperatures (and also considering changes in CO2 and rainfall) could boost global wheat yield by 7% and protein yield by 2%, but grain protein concentration would be reduced by −1.1 percentage points, representing a relative change of −8.6%. Climate change adaptations that benefit grain yield are not always positive for grain quality, putting additional pressure on global wheat production."
climate change,"The talk with present the key results of the IPCC Working Group III 5th assessment report. Concluding four years of intense scientific collaboration by hundreds of authors from around the world, the report responds to the request of the world's governments for a comprehensive, objective and policy neutral assessment of the current scientific knowledge on mitigating climate change. The report has been extensively reviewed by experts and governments to ensure quality and comprehensiveness."
climate change,"Climate, physical landscapes, and biota interact to generate heterogeneous hydrologic conditions in space and over time, which are reflected in spatial patterns of species distributions. As these species distributions respond to rapid climate change, microrefugia may support local species persistence in the face of deteriorating climatic suitability. Recent focus on temperature as a determinant of microrefugia insufficiently accounts for the importance of hydrologic processes and changing water availability with changing climate. Where water scarcity is a major limitation now or under future climates, hydrologic microrefugia are likely to prove essential for species persistence, particularly for sessile species and plants. Zones of high relative water availability – mesic microenvironments – are generated by a wide array of hydrologic processes, and may be loosely coupled to climatic processes and therefore buffered from climate change. Here, we review the mechanisms that generate mesic microenvironments and their likely robustness in the face of climate change. We argue that mesic microenvironments will act as species‐specific refugia only if the nature and space/time variability in water availability are compatible with the ecological requirements of a target species. We illustrate this argument with case studies drawn from California oak woodland ecosystems. We posit that identification of hydrologic refugia could form a cornerstone of climate‐cognizant conservation strategies, but that this would require improved understanding of climate change effects on key hydrologic processes, including frequently cryptic processes such as groundwater flow."
climate change,"Aviation causes climate change as a result of its emissions of CO2, oxides of nitrogen, aerosols, and water vapor. One simple method of quantifying the climate impact of past emissions is radiative forcing. The radiative forcing due to changes in CO2 is best characterized, but there are formidable difficulties in estimating the non-CO2 forcings – this is particularly the case for possible aviation-induced changes in cloudiness (AIC). The most recent comprehensive assessment gave a best estimate of the 2005 total radiative forcing due to aviation of about 55–78 mW m−2 depending on whether AIC was included or not, with an uncertainty of at least a factor of 2. The aviation CO2 radiative forcing represents about 1.6% of the total CO2 forcing from all human activities. It is estimated that, including the non-CO2 effects, aviation contributes between 1.3 and 14% of the total radiative forcing due to all human activities. Alternative methods for comparing the future impact of present-day aviation emissions are presented – the perception of the relative importance of the non-CO2 emissions, relative to CO2, depends considerably on the chosen method and the parameters chosen within those methods.

climate change,"Climate change has far‐reaching impacts on ecosystems. Recent attempts to quantify such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climate change but largely ignore ecosystem resistance and resilience, which may also affect the vulnerability outcomes. In this study, the relative vulnerability of global terrestrial ecosystems to short‐term climate variability was assessed by simultaneously integrating exposure, sensitivity, and resilience at a high spatial resolution (0.05°). The results show that vulnerable areas are currently distributed primarily in plains. Responses to climate change vary among ecosystems and deserts and xeric shrublands are the most vulnerable biomes. Global vulnerability patterns are determined largely by exposure, while ecosystem sensitivity and resilience may exacerbate or alleviate external climate pressures at local scales; there is a highly significant negative correlation between exposure and sensitivity. Globally, 61.31% of the terrestrial vegetated area is capable of mitigating climate change impacts and those areas are concentrated in polar regions, boreal forests, tropical rainforests, and intact forests. Under current sensitivity and resilience conditions, vulnerable areas are projected to develop in high Northern Hemisphere latitudes in the future. The results suggest that integrating all three aspects of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and resilience) may offer more comprehensive and spatially explicit adaptation strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems."
climate change,"Climate change is driving changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean that have consequences for marine ecosystems. Here, we review evidence for the responses of marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions, from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed changes in calcification rates, demography, abundance, distribution and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species’ responses, such as fishing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We find that general trends in species responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including poleward and deeper distributional shifts, advances in spring phenology, declines in calcification and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence of species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with much evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of marine biological impacts of climate change are of the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters) or ocean acidification. Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals)."
climate change,"Rapid climatic changes and increasing human influence at high elevations around the world will have profound impacts on mountain biodiversity. However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three types of lag: “dispersal lags” affecting plant species’ spread along elevational gradients, “establishment lags” following their arrival in recipient communities, and “extinction lags” of resident species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment. Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities might lag behind simple expectations based on species’ range shifts with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming. Our review and simulation support the view that accounting for disequilibrium range dynamics will be essential for realistic forecasts of patterns of biodiversity under climate change, with implications for the conservation of mountain species and the ecosystem functions they provide."
climate change,"Research can increasingly determine the contribution of climate change to extreme events such as droughts Human-induced climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes and has contributed to a widespread intensification of daily precipitation extremes (1, 2). But has it also made specific extreme weather and climate events—such as floods, droughts, and heat waves—more likely? Although it has been said that individual climate events cannot be attributed to anthropogenic climate change (3), a recent assessment by the National Academies of Science concludes that “this is no longer true as an unqualified blanket statement” (4). Robust event attribution can support decisions such as how to rebuild after a disaster and how to price insurance by quantifying the current risk of such events."
climate change,"Climate change is a very complex issue; policymakers need an objective source of information about the causes of climate change, its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences, and the adaptation and mitigation options to respond to it. The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1988 to provide an authoritative statement of scientific opinion on climate change."
climate change,"Bucking the trend Responses to climate change have been observed across many species. There is a general trend for species to shift their ranges poleward or up in elevation. Not all species, however, can make such shifts, and these species might experience more rapid declines. Kerr et al. looked at data on bumblebees across North America and Europe over the past 110 years. Bumblebees have not shifted northward and are experiencing shrinking distributions in the southern ends of their range. Such failures to shift may be because of their origins in a cooler climate, and suggest an elevated susceptibility to rapid climate change. Science, this issue p. 177 Cool-adapted bumblebees are failing to shift their ranges in response to climate warming. For many species, geographical ranges are expanding toward the poles in response to climate change, while remaining stable along range edges nearest the equator. Using long-term observations across Europe and North America over 110 years, we tested for climate change–related range shifts in bumblebee species across the full extents of their latitudinal and thermal limits and movements along elevation gradients. We found cross-continentally consistent trends in failures to track warming through time at species’ northern range limits, range losses from southern range limits, and shifts to higher elevations among southern species. These effects are independent of changing land uses or pesticide applications and underscore the need to test for climate impacts at both leading and trailing latitudinal and thermal limits for species."
climate change,"Climate change threatens the objective of eradicating poverty. Poor people and poor countries are already vulnerable to all types of climate-related shocks—natural disasters that destroy assets and livelihoods; water borne diseases and pests that becomemore prevalent during heat waves, floods, or droughts; crop failure from reduced rainfall; andspikes in food prices that follow extreme weather events. Such shocks can erase decades ofhard work and leave people with irreversible human and physical losses. Changes in climateconditions caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will worsen these shocks and slow down poverty reduction. The good news is that, at least until 2030, “good development” can prevent most of these impacts. By “good development,” we mean development that is rapid, inclusive, and climate informed; includes strong social safety nets and universal health coverage; and iscomplemented with targeted adaptation interventions such as heat-tolerant crops and early warning systems. Absent such good development, many people will still be living in or closeto extreme poverty in 2030, with few resources to cope with climate shocks and adapt to longterm trends, and climate change could increase extreme poverty by more than 100 million people by 2030. In the longer run, beyond 2030, our ability to adapt to unabated climate change is limited. To keep the longer-term impacts on poverty in check, immediate emissions-reduction policiesare needed that bring emissions to zero by the end of the 21st century. These policies neednot threaten short-term progress on poverty reduction—provided they are well designed andinternational support is available for poor countries.Ending poverty and stabilizing climate change will be unprecedented global achievements.But neither can be attained without the other: they need to be designed and implementedas an integrated strategy. Shock Waves: Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty brings together those two objectives and explores how they can more easily be achieved if considered together. The book provides guidance on how to design climate policies so they contribute to poverty reduction, and on how to design poverty reduction policies so they contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building."
climate change,"Significance Agriculture is arguably the sector most affected by climate change, but assessments differ and are thus difficult to compare. We provide a globally consistent, protocol-based, multimodel climate change assessment for major crops with explicit characterization of uncertainty. Results with multimodel agreement indicate strong negative effects from climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at low latitudes where developing countries are concentrated. Simulations that consider explicit nitrogen stress result in much more severe impacts from climate change, with implications for adaptation planning. Here we present the results from an intercomparison of multiple global gridded crop models (GGCMs) within the framework of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project and the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project. Results indicate strong negative effects of climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at low latitudes; models that include explicit nitrogen stress project more severe impacts. Across seven GGCMs, five global climate models, and four representative concentration pathways, model agreement on direction of yield changes is found in many major agricultural regions at both low and high latitudes; however, reducing uncertainty in sign of response in mid-latitude regions remains a challenge. Uncertainties related to the representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and high temperature effects demonstrated here show that further research is urgently needed to better understand effects of climate change on agricultural production and to devise targeted adaptation strategies."
climate change,"Bioenergy deployment offers significant potential for climate change mitigation, but also carries considerable risks. In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land‐use and energy experts, land‐use and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life‐cycle assessment experts. We summarize technological options, outline the state‐of‐the‐art knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end‐use efficiency, improved land carbon‐stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small‐scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100 EJ: high agreement; 100–300 EJ: medium agreement; above 300 EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245 EJ yr−1 to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large‐scale deployment (>200 EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2° degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land‐intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts. We conclude that the high variability in pathways, uncertainties in technological development and ambiguity in political decision render forecasts on deployment levels and climate effects very difficult. However, uncertainty about projections should not preclude pursuing beneficial bioenergy options."
climate change,"Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high‐temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single‐site or single‐species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change‐induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta‐analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971–2000). Our results showed that 78% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30% significantly) and only 3% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade−1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days°C−1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day°C−1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r=−0.69, P<0.001)."
climate change,"Climate conditions significantly affect vegetation growth in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems, the vegetation responses to climate vary considerably with the diverse spatial patterns and the time‐lag effects, which are the most important mechanism of climate–vegetation interactive effects. Extensive studies focused on large‐scale vegetation–climate interactions use the simultaneous meteorological and vegetation indicators to develop models; however, the time‐lag effects are less considered, which tends to increase uncertainty. In this study, we aim to quantitatively determine the time‐lag effects of global vegetation responses to different climatic factors using the GIMMS3g NDVI time series and the CRU temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation datasets. First, this study analyzed the time‐lag effects of global vegetation responses to different climatic factors. Then, a multiple linear regression model and partial correlation model were established to statistically analyze the roles of different climatic factors on vegetation responses, from which the primary climate‐driving factors for different vegetation types were determined. The results showed that (i) both the time‐lag effects of the vegetation responses and the major climate‐driving factors that significantly affect vegetation growth varied significantly at the global scale, which was related to the diverse vegetation and climate characteristics; (ii) regarding the time‐lag effects, the climatic factors explained 64% variation of the global vegetation growth, which was 11% relatively higher than the model ignoring the time‐lag effects; (iii) for the area with a significant change trend (for the period 1982–2008) in the global GIMMS3g NDVI (P < 0.05), the primary driving factor was temperature; and (iv) at the regional scale, the variation in vegetation growth was also related to human activities and natural disturbances. Considering the time‐lag effects is quite important for better predicting and evaluating the vegetation dynamics under the background of global climate change."
climate change,"Many studies have recorded phenotypic changes in natural populations and attributed them to climate change. However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing – and exclusion – of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known – and not known – about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed – and these must employ better inferential methods – before general conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we hope that the present paper and special issue provide inspiration for future research and guidelines on best practices for its execution."
climate change,"Global climate change is already having significant impacts on arctic and alpine ecosystems, and ongoing increases in temperature and altered precipitation patterns will affect the strong seasonal patterns that characterize these temperature‐limited systems. The length of the potential growing season in these tundra environments is increasing due to warmer temperatures and earlier spring snow melt. Here, we compare current and projected climate and ecological data from 20 Northern Hemisphere sites to identify how seasonal changes in the physical environment due to climate change will alter the seasonality of arctic and alpine ecosystems. We find that although arctic and alpine ecosystems appear similar under historical climate conditions, climate change will lead to divergent responses, particularly in the spring and fall shoulder seasons. As seasonality changes in the Arctic, plants will advance the timing of spring phenological events, which could increase plant nutrient uptake, production, and ecosystem carbon (C) gain. In alpine regions, photoperiod will constrain spring plant phenology, limiting the extent to which the growing season can lengthen, especially if decreased water availability from earlier snow melt and warmer summer temperatures lead to earlier senescence. The result could be a shorter growing season with decreased production and increased nutrient loss. These contrasting alpine and arctic ecosystem responses will have cascading effects on ecosystems, affecting community structure, biotic interactions, and biogeochemistry."
climate change,"Assisted gene flow (AGF) between populations has the potential to mitigate maladaptation due to climate change. However, AGF may cause outbreeding depression (especially if source and recipient populations have been long isolated) and may disrupt local adaptation to nonclimatic factors. Selection should eliminate extrinsic outbreeding depression due to adaptive differences in large populations, and simulations suggest that, within a few generations, evolution should resolve mild intrinsic outbreeding depression due to epistasis. To weigh the risks of AGF against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow. AGF should be a powerful tool for managing foundation and resource-producing species with large populations and broad ranges that show signs of historical adaptation to local climatic conditions."

climate change,"Evolutionary responses are required for tree populations to be able to track climate change. Results of 250 years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reflecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation‐related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90% and 78% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand specific issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration. Despite the long generation times, the strong background in quantitative genetics and growing genomic resources make forest trees useful species for climate change research. The greatest adaptive response is expected when populations are large, have high genetic variability, selection is strong, and there is ecological opportunity for establishment of better adapted genotypes."
climate change,"There is no integrated regime governing efforts to limit the extent of climate change. Instead, there is a regime complex: a loosely-coupled set of specific regimes. We describe the regime complex for climate change and seek to explain it, using interest-based, functional, and organizational arguments. This institutional form is likely to persist; efforts to build a comprehensive regime are unlikely to succeed, but experiments abound with narrower institutions focused on particular aspects of the climate change problem. Building on this analysis, we argue that a climate change regime complex, if it meets specified criteria, has advantages over any politically feasible comprehensive regime. Adaptability and flexibility are particularly important in a setting—such as climate change policy—in which the most demanding international commitments are interdependent yet governments vary widely in their interest and ability to implement them. Yet in view of the serious political constraints, both domestic and international, there is little reason for optimism that the climate regime complex that is emerging will lead to reductions in emissions rapid enough to meet widely discussed goals, such as stopping global warming at two degrees above pre-industrial levels."
climate change,"This Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) has been jointly coordinated by Working Groups I (WGI) and II (WGII) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

This Special Report, in particular, contributes to frame the challenge of dealing with extreme weather and climate events as an issue in decision making under uncertainty, analyzing response in the context of risk management. The report consists of nine chapters, covering risk management; observed and projected changes in extreme weather and climate events; exposure and vulnerability to as well as losses resulting from such events; adaptation options from the local to the international scale; the role of sustainable development in modulating risks; and insights from specific case studies.

climate change,"Recent advances in DNA-sequencing technologies now allow for in-depth characterization of the genomic stress responses of many organisms beyond model taxa. They are especially appropriate for organisms such as reef-building corals, for which dramatic declines in abundance are expected to worsen as anthropogenic climate change intensifies. Different corals differ substantially in physiological resilience to environmental stress, but the molecular mechanisms behind enhanced coral resilience remain unclear. Here, we compare transcriptome-wide gene expression (via RNA-Seq using Illumina sequencing) among conspecific thermally sensitive and thermally resilient corals to identify the molecular pathways contributing to coral resilience. Under simulated bleaching stress, sensitive and resilient corals change expression of hundreds of genes, but the resilient corals had higher expression under control conditions across 60 of these genes. These “frontloaded” transcripts were less up-regulated in resilient corals during heat stress and included thermal tolerance genes such as heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes, as well as a broad array of genes involved in apoptosis regulation, tumor suppression, innate immune response, and cell adhesion. We propose that constitutive frontloading enables an individual to maintain physiological resilience during frequently encountered environmental stress, an idea that has strong parallels in model systems such as yeast. Our study provides broad insight into the fundamental cellular processes responsible for enhanced stress tolerances that may enable some organisms to better persist into the future in an era of global climate change."
climate change,"Some of the most important impacts of global climate change will be felt among the populations, predominantly in developing countries, referred to as “subsistence” or “smallholder” farmers. Their vulnerability to climate change comes both from being predominantly located in the tropics, and from various socioeconomic, demographic, and policy trends limiting their capacity to adapt to change. However, these impacts will be difficult to model or predict because of (i) the lack of standardised definitions of these sorts of farming system, and therefore of standard data above the national level, (ii) intrinsic characteristics of these systems, particularly their complexity, their location-specificity, and their integration of agricultural and nonagricultural livelihood strategies, and (iii) their vulnerability to a range of climate-related and other stressors. Some recent work relevant to these farming systems is reviewed, a conceptual framework for understanding the diverse forms of impacts in an integrated manner is proposed, and future research needs are identified."
climate change,"Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to be a major cause of species extinctions in the next 100 years. But what will actually cause these extinctions? For example, will it be limited physiological tolerance to high temperatures, changing biotic interactions or other factors? Here, we systematically review the proximate causes of climate-change related extinctions and their empirical support. We find 136 case studies of climatic impacts that are potentially relevant to this topic. However, only seven identified proximate causes of demonstrated local extinctions due to anthropogenic climate change. Among these seven studies, the proximate causes vary widely. Surprisingly, none show a straightforward relationship between local extinction and limited tolerances to high temperature. Instead, many studies implicate species interactions as an important proximate cause, especially decreases in food availability. We find very similar patterns in studies showing decreases in abundance associated with climate change, and in those studies showing impacts of climatic oscillations. Collectively, these results highlight our disturbingly limited knowledge of this crucial issue but also support the idea that changing species interactions are an important cause of documented population declines and extinctions related to climate change. Finally, we briefly outline general research strategies for identifying these proximate causes in future studies."
climate change,"Climate variability in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) is dominated by the SH annular mode, a large-scale pattern of variability characterized by fluctuations in the strength of the circumpolar vortex. We present evidence that recent trends in the SH tropospheric circulation can be interpreted as a bias toward the high-index polarity of this pattern, with stronger westerly flow encircling the polar cap. It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau."
climate change,"With a pace of about twice the observed rate of global warming, the temperature on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau (Earth's ‘third pole’) has increased by 0.2 °C per decade over the past 50 years, which results in significant permafrost thawing and glacier retreat. Our review suggested that warming enhanced net primary production and soil respiration, decreased methane (CH4) emissions from wetlands and increased CH4 consumption of meadows, but might increase CH4 emissions from lakes. Warming‐induced permafrost thawing and glaciers melting would also result in substantial emission of old carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was not stimulated by warming itself, but might be slightly enhanced by wetting. However, there are many uncertainties in such biogeochemical cycles under climate change. Human activities (e.g. grazing, land cover changes) further modified the biogeochemical cycles and amplified such uncertainties on the plateau. If the projected warming and wetting continues, the future biogeochemical cycles will be more complicated. So facing research in this field is an ongoing challenge of integrating field observations with process‐based ecosystem models to predict the impacts of future climate change and human activities at various temporal and spatial scales. To reduce the uncertainties and to improve the precision of the predictions of the impacts of climate change and human activities on biogeochemical cycles, efforts should focus on conducting more field observation studies, integrating data within improved models, and developing new knowledge about coupling among carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles as well as about the role of microbes in these cycles."
climate change,"Many actors—including scientists, journalists, artists, and campaigning organizations—create visualizations of climate change. In doing so, they evoke climate change in particular ways, and make the issue meaningful in everyday discourse. While a diversity of climate change imagery exists, particular types of climate imagery appear to have gained dominance, promoting particular ways of knowing about climate change (and marginalizing others). This imagery, and public engagement with this imagery, helps to shape the cultural politics of climate change in important ways. This article critically reviews the nascent research area of the visual representations of climate change, and public engagement with visual imagery. It synthesizes a diverse body of research to explore visual representations and engagement across the news media, NGO communications, advertising, and marketing, climate science, art, and virtual reality systems. The discussion brings together three themes which occur throughout the review: time, truth, and power. The article concludes by suggesting fruitful directions for future research in the visual communication of climate change. WIREs Clim Change 2014, 5:73–87. doi: 10.1002/wcc.249"
climate change,"All human–environment systems adapt to climate and its natural variation. Adaptation to human-induced change in climate has largely been envisioned as increments of these adaptations intended to avoid disruptions of systems at their current locations. In some places, for some systems, however, vulnerabilities and risks may be so sizeable that they require transformational rather than incremental adaptations. Three classes of transformational adaptations are those that are adopted at a much larger scale, that are truly new to a particular region or resource system, and that transform places and shift locations. We illustrate these with examples drawn from Africa, Europe, and North America. Two conditions set the stage for transformational adaptation to climate change: large vulnerability in certain regions, populations, or resource systems; and severe climate change that overwhelms even robust human use systems. However, anticipatory transformational adaptation may be difficult to implement because of uncertainties about climate change risks and adaptation benefits, the high costs of transformational actions, and institutional and behavioral actions that tend to maintain existing resource systems and policies. Implementing transformational adaptation requires effort to initiate it and then to sustain the effort over time. In initiating transformational adaptation focusing events and multiple stresses are important, combined with local leadership. In sustaining transformational adaptation, it seems likely that supportive social contexts and the availability of acceptable options and resources for actions are key enabling factors. Early steps would include incorporating transformation adaptation into risk management and initiating research to expand the menu of innovative transformational adaptations."
climate change,"Avoiding dangerous climate change is one of the most urgent social risk issues we face today and understanding related public perceptions is critical to engaging the public with the major societal transformations required to combat climate change. Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in‐depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance—temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty—in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance. However, highlighting the potentially very serious distant impacts of climate change may also be useful in promoting sustainable behavior, even among those already concerned."
climate change,"ABSTRACT Thawing permafrost and the resulting microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon (C) is one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically, exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange. However, these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost, making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate."
climate change,"Increasing concern over the implications of climate change for biodiversity has led to the use of species–climate envelope models to project species extinction risk under climate‐change scenarios. However, recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model predictions and there remains a pressing need to validate models and to reduce uncertainties. Model validation is problematic as predictions are made for events that have not yet occurred. Resubstituition and data partitioning of present‐day data sets are, therefore, commonly used to test the predictive performance of models. However, these approaches suffer from the problems of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the calibration and validation sets. Using observed distribution shifts among 116 British breeding‐bird species over the past ∼20 years, we are able to provide a first independent validation of four envelope modelling techniques under climate change. Results showed good to fair predictive performance on independent validation, although rules used to assess model performance are difficult to interpret in a decision‐planning context. We also showed that measures of performance on nonindependent data provided optimistic estimates of models' predictive ability on independent data. Artificial neural networks and generalized additive models provided generally more accurate predictions of species range shifts than generalized linear models or classification tree analysis. Data for independent model validation and replication of this study are rare and we argue that perfect validation may not in fact be conceptually possible. We also note that usefulness of models is contingent on both the questions being asked and the techniques used. Implementations of species–climate envelope models for testing hypotheses and predicting future events may prove wrong, while being potentially useful if put into appropriate context."
climate change,"Climate change is expected to impact ecosystems directly, such as through shifting climatic controls on species ranges, and indirectly, for example through changes in human land use that may result in habitat loss. Shifting patterns of agricultural production in response to climate change have received little attention as a potential impact pathway for ecosystems. Wine grape production provides a good test case for measuring indirect impacts mediated by changes in agriculture, because viticulture is sensitive to climate and is concentrated in Mediterranean climate regions that are global biodiversity hotspots. Here we demonstrate that, on a global scale, the impacts of climate change on viticultural suitability are substantial, leading to possible conservation conflicts in land use and freshwater ecosystems. Area suitable for viticulture decreases 25% to 73% in major wine producing regions by 2050 in the higher RCP 8.5 concentration pathway and 19% to 62% in the lower RCP 4.5. Climate change may cause establishment of vineyards at higher elevations that will increase impacts on upland ecosystems and may lead to conversion of natural vegetation as production shifts to higher latitudes in areas such as western North America. Attempts to maintain wine grape productivity and quality in the face of warming may be associated with increased water use for irrigation and to cool grapes through misting or sprinkling, creating potential for freshwater conservation impacts. Agricultural adaptation and conservation efforts are needed that anticipate these multiple possible indirect effects."
climate change,"Significance Plausible estimates of climate change impacts on agriculture require integrated use of climate, crop, and economic models. We investigate the contribution of economic models to uncertainty in this impact chain. In the nine economic models included, the direction of management intensity, area, consumption, and international trade responses to harmonized crop yield shocks from climate change are similar. However, the magnitudes differ significantly. The differences depend on model structure, in particular the specification of endogenous yield effects, land use change, and propensity to trade. These results highlight where future research on modeling climate change impacts on agriculture should focus. Agricultural production is sensitive to weather and thus directly affected by climate change. Plausible estimates of these climate change impacts require combined use of climate, crop, and economic models. Results from previous studies vary substantially due to differences in models, scenarios, and data. This paper is part of a collective effort to systematically integrate these three types of models. We focus on the economic component of the assessment, investigating how nine global economic models of agriculture represent endogenous responses to seven standardized climate change scenarios produced by two climate and five crop models. These responses include adjustments in yields, area, consumption, and international trade. We apply biophysical shocks derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s representative concentration pathway with end-of-century radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2. The mean biophysical yield effect with no incremental CO2 fertilization is a 17% reduction globally by 2050 relative to a scenario with unchanging climate. Endogenous economic responses reduce yield loss to 11%, increase area of major crops by 11%, and reduce consumption by 3%. Agricultural production, cropland area, trade, and prices show the greatest degree of variability in response to climate change, and consumption the lowest. The sources of these differences include model structure and specification; in particular, model assumptions about ease of land use conversion, intensification, and trade. This study identifies where models disagree on the relative responses to climate shocks and highlights research activities needed to improve the representation of agricultural adaptation responses to climate change."
climate change,"Biotic interactions drive key ecological and evolutionary processes and mediate ecosystem responses to climate change. The direction, frequency, and intensity of biotic interactions can in turn be altered by climate change. Understanding the complex interplay between climate and biotic interactions is thus essential for fully anticipating how ecosystems will respond to the fast rates of current warming, which are unprecedented since the end of the last glacial period. We highlight episodes of climate change that have disrupted ecosystems and trophic interactions over time scales ranging from years to millennia by changing species’ relative abundances and geographic ranges, causing extinctions, and creating transient and novel communities dominated by generalist species and interactions. These patterns emerge repeatedly across disparate temporal and spatial scales, suggesting the possibility of similar underlying processes. Based on these findings, we identify knowledge gaps and fruitful areas for research that will further our understanding of the effects of climate change on ecosystems."
climate change,"While there is a general sense that lakes can act as sentinels of climate change, their efficacy has not been thoroughly analyzed. We identified the key response variables within a lake that act as indicators of the effects of climate change on both the lake and the catchment. These variables reflect a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate. However, the efficacy of the different indicators is affected by regional response to climate change, characteristics of the catchment, and lake mixing regimes. Thus, particular indicators or combinations of indicators are more effective for different lake types and geographic regions. The extraction of climate signals can be further complicated by the influence of other environmental changes, such as eutrophication or acidification, and the equivalent reverse phenomena, in addition to other land‐use influences. In many cases, however, confounding factors can be addressed through analytical tools such as detrending or filtering. Lakes are effective sentinels for climate change because they are sensitive to climate, respond rapidly to change, and integrate information about changes in the catchment."
climate change,"Climate change can impact the pattern of marine biodiversity through changes in species’ distributions. However, global studies on climate change impacts on ocean biodiversity have not been performed so far. Our paper aims to investigate the global patterns of such impacts by projecting the distributional ranges of a sample of 1066 exploited marine fish and invertebrates for 2050 using a newly developed dynamic bioclimate envelope model. Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services. Our projections can be viewed as a set of hypothesis for future analytical and empirical studies."
climate change,"Economists are increasingly using weather data and climate model output in analyses of the economic impacts of climate change. This article introduces weather data sets and climate models that are frequently used, discusses the most common mistakes economists make in using these products, and identifies ways to avoid these pitfalls. We first provide an introduction to weather data, including a summary of the types of data sets available, and then we discuss five common pitfalls that empirical researchers should be aware of when using historical weather data as explanatory variables in econometric applications. We then provide a brief overview of climate models and discuss two common and significant errors often made by economists when climate model output is used to simulate the future impacts of climate change on an economic outcome of interest."
climate change,"Modern climate change is dominated by human influences, which are now large enough to exceed the bounds of natural variability. The main source of global climate change is human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. These perturbations primarily result from emissions associated with energy use, but on local and regional scales, urbanization and land use changes are also important. Although there has been progress in monitoring and understanding climate change, there remain many scientific, technical, and institutional impediments to precisely planning for, adapting to, and mitigating the effects of climate change. There is still considerable uncertainty about the rates of change that can be expected, but it is clear that these changes will be increasingly manifested in important and tangible ways, such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation, decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent, and sea level rise. Anthropogenic climate change is now likely to continue for many centuries. We are venturing into the unknown with climate, and its associated impacts could be quite disruptive."

climate change,"As climates change across already stressed ecosystems, there is no doubt that species will be affected, but to what extent and which will be most vulnerable remain uncertain. The fossil record suggests that most species persisted through past climate change, whereas forecasts of future impacts predict large-scale range reduction and extinction. Many species have altered range limits and phenotypes through 20th-century climate change, but responses are highly variable. The proximate causes of species decline relative to resilience remain largely obscure; however, recent examples of climate-associated species decline can help guide current management in parallel with ongoing research."
climate change,"Executive summary The 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change has been formed to map out the impacts of climate change, and the necessary policy responses, in order to ensure the highest attainable standards of health for populations worldwide. This Commission is multi­ disciplinary and international in nature, with strong collabor ation between academic centres in Europe and China. The central finding from the Commission's work is that tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century. The key messages from the Commission are summarised below, accompanied by ten underlying recommendations to accelerate action in the next 5 years. The effects of climate change are being felt today, and future projections represent an unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health The implications of climate change for a global population of 9 billion people threatens to undermine the last half century of gains in development and global health. The direct effects of climate change include increased heat stress, floods, drought, and increased frequency of intense storms, with the indirect threatening population health through adverse changes in air pollution, the spread of disease vectors, food insecurity and under­nutrition, displacement, and mental ill health. Keeping the global average temperature rise to less than 2°C to avoid the risk of potentially catastrophic climate change impacts requires total anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions to be kept below 2900 billion tonnes (GtCO 2) by the end of the century. As of 2011, total emissions since 1870 were a little over half of this, with current trends expected to exceed 2900 GtCO 2 in the next 15–30 years. High­end emissions projection scenarios show global average warming of 2·6–4·8°C by the end of the century, with all their regional amplification and attendant impacts. Tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century Given the potential of climate change to reverse the health gains from economic development, and the health co­benefits that accrue from actions for a sustainable economy, tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of this century. Many mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change are "" no­regret "" options, which lead to direct reductions in the burden of ill­health, enhance community resilience, alleviate poverty, and address global inequity. Benefits are realised by ensuring that countries are unconstrained by climate change, enabling them to achieve better health and wellbeing for …"
climate change,"Aim  Identifying and protecting refugia is a priority for conservation under projected anthropogenic climate change, because of their demonstrated ability to facilitate the survival of biota under adverse conditions. Refugia are habitats that components of biodiversity retreat to, persist in and can potentially expand from under changing environmental conditions. However, the study and discussion of refugia has often been ad hoc and descriptive in nature. We therefore: (1) provide a habitat-based concept of refugia, and (2) evaluate methods for the identification of refugia. 
 
Location  Global. 
 
Methods  We present a simple conceptual framework for refugia and examine the factors that describe them. We then demonstrate how different disciplines are contributing to our understanding of refugia, and the tools that they provide for identifying and quantifying refugia. 
 
Results  Current understanding of refugia is largely based on Quaternary phylogeographic studies on organisms in North America and Europe during significant temperature fluctuations. This has resulted in gaps in our understanding of refugia, particularly when attempting to apply current theory to forecast anthropogenic climate change. Refugia are environmental habitats with space and time dimensions that operate on evolutionary time-scales and have facilitated the survival of biota under changing environmental conditions for millennia. Therefore, they offer the best chances for survival under climate change for many taxa, making their identification important for conservation under anthropogenic climate change. Several methods from various disciplines provide viable options for achieving this goal. 
 
Main conclusions  The framework developed for refugia allows the identification and description of refugia in any environment. Various methods provide important contributions but each is limited in scope; urging a more integrated approach to identify, define and conserve refugia. Such an approach will facilitate better understanding of refugia and their capacity to act as safe havens under projected anthropogenic climate change."
climate change,"This Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) has been jointly coordinated by Working Groups I (WGI) and II (WGII) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report focuses on the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and climate events, the impacts of such events, and the strategies to manage the associated risks. This Special Report, in particular, contributes to frame the challenge of dealing with extreme weather and climate events as an issue in decision making under uncertainty, analyzing response in the context of risk management. The report consists of nine chapters, covering risk management; observed and projected changes in extreme weather and climate events; exposure and vulnerability to as well as losses resulting from such events; adaptation options from the local to the international scale; the role of sustainable development in modulating risks; and insights from specific case studies.

climate change,"This paper reviews observed (1900-2000) and possible future (2000-2100) continent- wide changes in temperature and rainfall for Africa. For the historic period we draw upon a new observed global climate data set which allows us to explore aspects of regional climate change related to diurnal temperature range and rainfall variability. The latter includes an investigation of regions where seasonal rainfall is sensitive to El Nino climate variability. This review of past climate change provides the context for our scenarios of future greenhouse gas-induced climate change in Africa. These scenarios draw upon the draft emissions scenarios prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Third Assessment Report, a suite of recent global climate model experi- ments, and a simple climate model to link these 2 sets of analyses. We present a range of 4 climate futures for Africa, focusing on changes in both continental and regional seasonal-mean temperature and rainfall. Estimates of associated changes in global CO2 concentration and global-mean sea-level change are also supplied. These scenarios draw upon some of the most recent climate modelling work. We also identify some fundamental limitations to knowledge with regard to future African cli- mate. These include the often poor representation of El Nino climate variability in global climate models, and the absence in these models of any representation of regional changes in land cover and dust and biomass aerosol loadings. These omitted processes may well have important consequences for future African climates, especially at regional scales. We conclude by discussing the value of the sort of climate change scenarios presented here and how best they should be used in national and regional vulnerability and adaptation assessments."
climate change,"In our 2005 paper, Rethinking Sustainable Cities, we made a case for the increasing significance of climate change in the urban politics of sustainability. Taking a multilevel governance perspective, we argued that the ‘urban’ governance of climate protection was not confined to a local arena or to the actions of the state, but rather was orchestrated through the interrelations between global, national and local actors across state/non-state boundaries. We revisit these arguments and examine their validity in the light of the rapidly changing landscape of urban responses to climate change and the growing academic literature in this field. We consider in turn: the ways in which climate change is shaping urban agendas; the utility of multilevel governance perspectives for understanding this phenomenon; and the extent to which we can identify a ‘new’ politics of urban climate change governance and its consequent implications for the development of theory and practice in this field."
climate change,Climate change affects the range of pathogens and temperatures to which populations are exposed. This article reviews the nature of these changes and explores how efforts to mitigate climate change could be of value to the global community.
climate change,"As climate change progresses, we are observing widespread changes in phenotypes in many plant populations. Whether these phenotypic changes are directly caused by climate change, and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution, are active areas of investigation. Here, we review terrestrial plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for inclusion, all found plastic or evolutionary responses, with 26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by eight of 12 studies that examined this directly. There is also mixed evidence for whether evolutionary responses are adaptive, and whether they are directly caused by contemporary climatic changes. We discuss factors that will likely influence the extent of plastic and evolutionary responses, including patterns of environmental changes, species’ life history characteristics including generation time and breeding system, and degree and direction of gene flow. Future studies with standardized methodologies, especially those that use direct approaches assessing responses to climate change over time, and sharing of data through public databases, will facilitate better predictions of the capacity for plant populations to respond to rapid climate change."

climate change,"There is ample evidence for ecological responses to recent climate change. Most studies to date have concentrated on the effects of climate change on individuals and species, with particular emphasis on the effects on phenology and physiology of organisms as well as changes in the distribution and range shifts of species. However, responses by individual species to climate change are not isolated; they are connected through interactions with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels. Also from this more complex perspective, recent case studies have emphasized evidence on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services. This review highlights the ‘knowns’ but also ‘unknowns’ resulting from recent climate impact studies and reveals limitations of (linear) extrapolations from recent climate-induced responses of species to expected trends and magnitudes of future climate change. Hence, there is need not only to continue to focus on the impacts of climate change on the actors in ecological networks but also and more intensively to focus on the linkages between them, and to acknowledge that biotic interactions and feedback processes lead to highly complex, nonlinear and sometimes abrupt responses."
climate change,"Biological invasion is increasingly recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Using ensemble forecasts from species distribution models to project future suitable areas of the 100 of the world's worst invasive species defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we show that both climate and land use changes will likely cause drastic species range shifts. Looking at potential spatial aggregation of invasive species, we identify three future hotspots of invasion in Europe, northeastern North America, and Oceania. We also emphasize that some regions could lose a significant number of invasive alien species, creating opportunities for ecosystem restoration. From the list of 100, scenarios of potential range distributions show a consistent shrinking for invasive amphibians and birds, while for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates distributions are projected to substantially increase in most cases. Given the harmful impacts these invasive species currently have on ecosystems, these species will likely dramatically influence the future of biodiversity."

We also incorporate relevant material presented by SCAR to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, and make use of emerging results that will form part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report."

However, little is known about which factors predict engagement with climate change, and which messaging strategies are most effective. A community sample of 324 residents from three regions in British Columbia read information either about a climate change impact relevant to their local area, a more global one, or, in a control condition, no message. Participants indicated the extent of their climate change engagement, the strength of their attachment to their local area, and demographic information. Three significant unique predictors of climate change engagement emerged: place attachment, receiving the local message, and gender (female). These results provide empirical support for some previously proposed barriers to climate action and suggest guidelines for effective climate change communication."

climate change,"An increasing number of short-term experimental studies show significant effects of projected ocean warming and ocean acidification on the performance on marine organisms. Yet, it remains unclear if we can reliably predict the impact of climate change on marine populations and ecosystems, because we lack sufficient understanding of the capacity for marine organisms to adapt to rapid climate change. In this review, we emphasise why an evolutionary perspective is crucial to understanding climate change impacts in the sea and examine the approaches that may be useful for addressing this challenge. We first consider what the geological record and present-day analogues of future climate conditions can tell us about the potential for adaptation to climate change. We also examine evidence that phenotypic plasticity may assist marine species to persist in a rapidly changing climate. We then outline the various experimental approaches that can be used to estimate evolutionary potential, focusing on molecular tools, quantitative genetics, and experimental evolution, and we describe the benefits of combining different approaches to gain a deeper understanding of evolutionary potential. Our goal is to provide a platform for future research addressing the evolutionary potential for marine organisms to cope with climate change."

climate change,"This review examines the direct effects of climate change on insect herbivores. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO2 or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life‐history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term."
climate change,"I review the literature on the economic impacts of climate change, an externality that is unprecedentedly large, complex, and uncertain. Only 14 estimates of the total damage cost of climate change have been published, a research effort that is in sharp contrast to the urgency of the public debate and the proposed expenditure on greenhouse gas emission reduction. These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is $50/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100. From a welfare perspective, the impact of climate change is problematic because population is endogenous, and because policy analyses should separate impatience, risk aversion, and inequity aversion between and within countries."
climate change,"Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on economic outcomes requires knowing how agents might adapt to a changing climate. We exploit large variation in recent temperature and precipitation trends to identify adaptation to climate change in US agriculture, and use this information to generate new estimates of the potential impact of future climate change on agricultural outcomes. Longer run adaptations appear to have mitigated less than half--and more likely none--of the large negative short-run impacts of extreme heat on productivity. Limited recent adaptation implies substantial losses under future climate change in the absence of countervailing investments."
climate change,"There are multiple observations around the globe showing that in many avian species, both the timing of migration and breeding have advanced, due to warmer springs. Here, we review the literature to disentangle the actions of evolutionary changes in response to selection induced by climate change versus changes due to individual plasticity, that is, the capacity of an individual to adjust its phenology to environmental variables. Within the abundant literature on climate change effects on bird phenology, only a small fraction of studies are based on individual data, yet individual data are required to quantify the relative importance of plastic versus evolutionary responses. While plasticity seems common and often adaptive, no study so far has provided direct evidence for an evolutionary response of bird phenology to current climate change. This assessment leads us to notice the alarming lack of tests for microevolutionary changes in bird phenology in response to climate change, in contrast with the abundant claims on this issue. In short, at present we cannot draw reliable conclusions on the processes underlying the observed patterns of advanced phenology in birds. Rapid improvements in techniques for gathering and analysing individual data offer exciting possibilities that should encourage research activity to fill this knowledge gap."
climate change,"We review the evidence of how organisms and populations are currently responding to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, genotypic evolution, changes in distribution and, in some cases, local extinction. Organisms alter their gene expression and metabolism to increase the concentrations of several antistress compounds and to change their physiology, phenology, growth and reproduction in response to climate change. Rapid adaptation and microevolution occur at the population level. Together with these phenotypic and genotypic adaptations, the movement of organisms and the turnover of populations can lead to migration toward habitats with better conditions unless hindered by barriers. Both migration and local extinction of populations have occurred. However, many unknowns for all these processes remain. The roles of phenotypic plasticity and genotypic evolution and their possible trade‐offs and links with population structure warrant further research. The application of omic techniques to ecological studies will greatly favor this research. It remains poorly understood how climate change will result in asymmetrical responses of species and how it will interact with other increasing global impacts, such as N eutrophication, changes in environmental N : P ratios and species invasion, among many others. The biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks on climate of all these changes in vegetation are also poorly understood. We here review the evidence of responses to climate change and discuss the perspectives for increasing our knowledge of the interactions between climate change and life."
climate change,"Climate change has led to shifts in phenology in many species distributed widely across taxonomic groups. It is, however, unclear how we should interpret these shifts without some sort of a yardstick: a measure that will reflect how much a species should be shifting to match the change in its environment caused by climate change. Here, we assume that the shift in the phenology of a species' food abundance is, by a first approximation, an appropriate yardstick. We review the few examples that are available, ranging from birds to marine plankton. In almost all of these examples, the phenology of the focal species shifts either too little (five out of 11) or too much (three out of 11) compared to the yardstick. Thus, many species are becoming mistimed due to climate change. We urge researchers with long-term datasets on phenology to link their data with those that may serve as a yardstick, because documentation of the incidence of climate change-induced mistiming is crucial in assessing the impact of global climate change on the natural world."
climate change,"The objective of this paper is to determine the ability of farmers in Africa to detect climate change, and to ascertain how they have adapted to whatever climate change they believe has occurred. The paper also asks farmers whether they perceive any barriers to adaptation and attempts to determine the characteristics of those farmers who, despite claiming to have witnessed climate change, have not yet responded to it. The study is based on a large-scale survey of agriculturalists in 11 African countries. The survey reveals that significant numbers of farmers believe that temperatures have already increased and that precipitation has declined. Those with the greatest experience of farming are more likely to notice climate change. Further, neighboring farmers tell a consistent story. There are important differences in the propensity of farmers living in different locations to adapt and there may be institutional impediments to adaptation in some countries. Although large numbers of farmers perceive no barriers to adaptation, those that do perceive them tend to cite their poverty and inability to borrow. Few if any farmers mentioned lack of appropriate seed, security of tenure, or market accessibility as problems. Those farmers who perceive climate change but fail to respond may require particular incentives or assistance to do what is ultimately in their own best interests. Although experienced farmers are more likely to perceive climate change, it is educated farmers who are more likely to respond by making at least one adaptation."
climate change,"Ectotherms are considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate warming. Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions. Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate ‘realized’ thermal reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the ‘fundamental’ norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing ‘thermal safety margins’. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have generally been ignored in the climate change literature."
climate change,"Dispersal is fundamental in determining biodiversity responses to rapid climate change, but recently acquired ecological and evolutionary knowledge is seldom accounted for in either predictive methods or conservation planning. We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species’ range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation. 
 
Synthesis 
 
This article seeks synthesis across the fields of dispersal ecology and evolution, species distribution modelling and conservation biology. Increasing effort focuses on understanding how dispersal influences species' responses to climate change. Importantly, though perhaps not broadly widely-recognised, species' dispersal characteristics are themselves likely to alter during rapid climate change. We compile evidence for direct and indirect influences that climate change may have on dispersal, some ecological and others evolutionary. We emphasise the need for predictive modelling to account for this dispersal realism and highlight the need for conservation to make better use of our existing knowledge related to dispersal."
climate change,"Future disruptions to fire activity will threaten ecosystems and human well-being throughout the world, yet there are few fire projections at global scales and almost none from a broad range of global climate models (GCMs). Here we integrate global fire datasets and environmental covariates to build spatial statistical models of fire probability at a 0.5° resolution and examine environmental controls on fire activity. Fire models are driven by climate norms from 16 GCMs (A2 emissions scenario) to assess the magnitude and direction of change over two time periods, 2010–2039 and 2070–2099. From the ensemble results, we identify areas of consensus for increases or decreases in fire activity, as well as areas where GCMs disagree. Although certain biomes are sensitive to constraints on biomass productivity and others to atmospheric conditions promoting combustion, substantial and rapid shifts are projected for future fire activity across vast portions of the globe. In the near term, the most consistent increases in fire activity occur in biomes with already somewhat warm climates; decreases are less pronounced and concentrated primarily in a few tropical and subtropical biomes. However, models do not agree on the direction of near-term changes across more than 50% of terrestrial lands, highlighting major uncertainties in the next few decades. By the end of the century, the magnitude and the agreement in direction of change are projected to increase substantially. Most far-term model agreement on increasing fire probabilities (∼62%) occurs at mid- to high-latitudes, while agreement on decreasing probabilities (∼20%) is mainly in the tropics. Although our global models demonstrate that long-term environmental norms are very successful at capturing chronic fire probability patterns, future work is necessary to assess how much more explanatory power would be added through interannual variation in climate variables. This study provides a first examination of global disruptions to fire activity using an empirically based statistical framework and a multi-model ensemble of GCM projections, an important step toward assessing fire-related vulnerabilities to humans and the ecosystems upon which they depend."
climate change,"Within the past 25 years, climate change has evolved from an issue of interest primarily to some natural scientists into one of the top priorities on the global policy agenda. Research in political science and related fields offers systematic and empirically well-supported explanations for why solving the climate problem has turned out to be more difficult than originally anticipated. After reviewing this research, I focus on four areas in which we know less: (a) institutional design features that may help in mitigating or overcoming fundamental problems in the global cooperative effort; (b) factors that are driving variation in climate policies at national and subnational levels; (c) driving forces of climate policy beyond the state, in particular civil society, the science–policy interface, and public opinion; and (d) sociopolitical consequences of failing to avoid major climatic changes. The article concludes by identifying key questions at the micro, meso, and macro levels that should be addressed by ..."
climate change,"Many decisions concerning long-lived investments already need to take into account climate change. But doing so is not easy for at least two reasons. First, due to the rate of climate change, new infrastructure will have to be able to cope with a large range of changing climate conditions, which will make design more difficult and construction more expensive. Second, uncertainty in future climate makes it impossible to directly use the output of a single climate model as an input for infrastructure design, and there are good reasons to think that the needed climate informationwill not be available soon. Instead of optimizing based on the climate conditions projected by models, therefore, future infrastructure should be made more robust to possible changes in climate conditions. This aim implies that users of climate information must also change their practices and decision-making frameworks, for instance by adapting the uncertainty-management methods they currently apply to exchange rates or RD (ii) favouring reversible and flexible options; (iii) buying ‘‘safety margins’’ in new investments; (iv) promoting soft adaptation strategies, including long-term prospective; and (v) reducing decision time horizons. Moreover, it is essential to consider both negative and positive side-effects and externalities of adaptation measures. Adaptation–mitigation interactions also call for integrated design and assessment of adaptation and mitigation policies, which are often developed by distinct"
climate change,"Anthropogenic global warming has significantly influenced physical and biological processes at global and regional scales. The observed and anticipated changes in global climate present significant opportunities and challenges for societies and economies. We compare the vulnerability of 132 national economies to potential climate change impacts on their capture fisheries using an indicator-based approach. Countries in Central and Western Africa (e.g. Malawi, Guinea, Senegal, and Uganda), Peru and Colombia in north-western South America, and four tropical Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Yemen) were identified as most vulnerable. This vulnerability was due to the combined effect of predicted warming, the relative importance of fisheries to national economies and diets, and limited societal capacity to adapt to potential impacts and opportunities. Many vulnerable countries were also among the world’s least developed countries whose inhabitants are among the world’s poorest and twice as reliant on fish, which provides 27% of dietary protein compared to 13% in less vulnerable countries. These countries also produce 20% of the world’s fish exports and are in greatest need of adaptation planning to maintain or enhance the contribution that fisheries can make to poverty reduction. Although the precise impacts and direction of climate-driven change for particular fish stocks and fisheries are uncertain, our analysis suggests they are likely to lead to either increased economic hardship or missed opportunities for development in countries that depend upon fisheries but lack the capacity to adapt."
climate change,"Climate is a potent selective force in natural populations, yet the importance of adaptation in the response of plant species to past climate change has been questioned. As many species are unlikely to migrate fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic diversity within populations."
climate change,"Assessing the Arctic The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid climate change currently under way across the globe, but consequent ecological responses have not been widely reported. At the close of the Fourth International Polar Year, Post et al. (p. 1355) review observations on ecological impacts in this sensitive region. The widespread changes occurring in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, presage changes at lower latitudes that will affect natural resources, food production, and future climate buffering. At the close of the Fourth International Polar Year, we take stock of the ecological consequences of recent climate change in the Arctic, focusing on effects at population, community, and ecosystem scales. Despite the buffering effect of landscape heterogeneity, Arctic ecosystems and the trophic relationships that structure them have been severely perturbed. These rapid changes may be a bellwether of changes to come at lower latitudes and have the potential to affect ecosystem services related to natural resources, food production, climate regulation, and cultural integrity. We highlight areas of ecological research that deserve priority as the Arctic continues to warm."
climate change,"Abstract:  Scientific and societal unknowns make it difficult to predict how global environmental changes such as climate change and biological invasions will affect ecological systems. In the long term, these changes may have interacting effects and compound the uncertainty associated with each individual driver. Nonetheless, invasive species are likely to respond in ways that should be qualitatively predictable, and some of these responses will be distinct from those of native counterparts. We used the stages of invasion known as the “invasion pathway” to identify 5 nonexclusive consequences of climate change for invasive species: (1) altered transport and introduction mechanisms, (2) establishment of new invasive species, (3) altered impact of existing invasive species, (4) altered distribution of existing invasive species, and (5) altered effectiveness of control strategies. We then used these consequences to identify testable hypotheses about the responses of invasive species to climate change and provide suggestions for invasive‐species management plans. The 5 consequences also emphasize the need for enhanced environmental monitoring and expanded coordination among entities involved in invasive‐species management."
climate change,"This review focuses on the impacts of climate change on population dynamics. I introduce the MUP (Measuring, Understanding, and Predicting) approach, which provides a general framework where an enhanced understanding of climate‐population processes, along with improved long‐term data, are merged into coherent projections of future population responses to climate change. This approach can be applied to any species, but this review illustrates its benefit using birds as examples."
climate change,"Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change."

climate change,"This study analyzed determinants of farm-level climate adaptation measures in Africa using a multinomial choice model fitted to data from a cross-sectional survey of over 8000 farms from 11 African countries. The results indicate that specialized crop cultivation (mono-cropping) is the agricultural practice most vulnerable to climate change in Africa. Warming, especially in summer, poses the highest risk. It encourages irrigation, multiple cropping and integration of livestock. Increased precipitation reduces the probability of irrigation and will benefit most African farms, especially in drier areas. Better access to markets, extension and credit services, technology and farm assets (labor, land and capital) are critical for helping African farmers adapt to climate change. Government policies and investment strategies must support education, markets, credit and information about adaptation to climate change, including technological and institutional methods, particularly for poor farmers in the dry areas of Africa."
climate change,"Abstract: Global climate change is frequently considered a major conservation threat. The Earth's climate has already warmed by 0.5° C over the past century, and recent studies show that it is possible to detect the effects of a changing climate on ecological systems. This suggests that global change may be a current and future conservation threat. Changes in recent decades are apparent at all levels of ecological organization: population and life‐history changes, shifts in geographic range, changes in species composition of communities, and changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. These ecological effects can be linked to recent population declines and to both local and global extinctions of species. Although it is impossible to prove that climate change is the cause of these ecological effects, these findings have important implications for conservation biology. It is no longer safe to assume that all of a species' historic range remains suitable. In drawing attention to the importance of climate change as a current threat to species, these studies emphasize the need for current conservation efforts to consider climate change in both in situ conservation and reintroduction efforts. Additional threats will emerge as climate continues to change, especially as climate interacts with other stressors such as habitat fragmentation. These studies can contribute to preparations for future challenges by providing valuable input to models and direct examples of how species respond to climate change."
climate change,"This article considers scientific and public understand-ings of climate change and addresses the following question: Why is it that while scientific evidence has accumulated to document global climate change and scientific opinion has solidified about its existence and causes, U.S. public opinion has not and has instead become more polarized? Our review supports a con-structivist account of human judgment. Public understanding is affected by the inherent difficulty of understanding climate change, the mismatch between people's usual modes of understanding and the task, and, particularly in the United States, a continuing societal struggle to shape the frames and mental models people use to understand the phenomena. We conclude by discussing ways in which psychology can help to improve public understanding of climate change and link a better understanding to action. C limate change "" is the name given to a set of physical phenomena and of a public policy issue, sometimes also referred to as "" global warming, "" even though climate change involves much more than warming. This article describes the development of scientific and public understanding 1 of climate change in the United States, focusing especially on the riddle of noncor-respondence: Why, as scientific understanding of climate change has solidified, has U.S. public understanding not, and instead become more polarized? It also considers the implications of this situation for the future of public understanding and action. "" Climate change "" emerged as a public policy issue with improved scientific understanding of the phenomena involved, resulting in concerns. In 1959 an observatory on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, recorded a mean level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) of 315 parts per million , well above the highest concentration—no more than 300 parts per million—revealed in the 420,000-year-old ice-core record. By the end of the 1970s, CO 2 levels had reached 335 parts per million (Hecht & Tir-pak, 1995). The National Research Council, asked to investigate the subject, suggested, "" If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group finds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible "" (Climate Research Board, 1979, p. vii). In 1987, Congress passed the Global Climate Protection Act and directed the Environmental Protection Agency to propose to Congress a coordinated national policy on global climate change and the Secretary of State to coordinate diplomatic efforts to combat global warming. The Global Change Research Act …"
climate change,"The public rely upon media representations to help interpret and make sense of the many complexities relating to climate science and governance. Media representations of climate issues – from news to entertainment – are powerful and important links between people's everyday realities and experiences, and the ways in which they are discussed by scientists, policymakers and public actors. A dynamic mix of influences – from internal workings of mass media such as journalistic norms, to external political, economic, cultural and social factors – shape what becomes a climate 'story'. Providing a bridge between academic considerations and real world developments, this book helps students, academic researchers and interested members of the public make sense of media reporting on climate change as it explores 'who speaks for climate' and what effects this may have on the spectrum of possible responses to contemporary climate challenges."
climate change,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment of major risks for African agriculture and food security caused by climate change during coming decades is confirmed by a review of more recent climate change impact assessments (14 quantitative, six qualitative). Projected impacts relative to current production levels range from −100% to +168% in econometric, from −84% to +62% in process-based, and from −57% to +30% in statistical assessments. Despite large uncertainty, there are several robust conclusions from published literature for policy makers and research agendas: agriculture everywhere in Africa runs some risk to be negatively affected by climate change; existing cropping systems and infrastructure will have to change to meet future demand. With respect to growing population and the threat of negative climate change impacts, science will now have to show if and how agricultural production in Africa can be significantly improved."
climate change,"Global food production must increase by 50% to meet the projected demand of the world’s population by 2050. Meeting this difficult challenge will be made even harder if climate change melts portions of the Himalayan glaciers to affect 25% of world cereal production in Asia by influencing water availability. Pest and disease management has played its role in doubling food production in the last 40 years, but pathogens still claim 10–16% of the global harvest. We consider the effect of climate change on the many complex biological interactions affecting pests and pathogen impacts and how they might be manipulated to mitigate these effects. Integrated solutions and international co-ordination in their implementation are considered essential. Providing a background on key constraints to food security, this overview uses fusarium head blight as a case study to illustrate key influences of climate change on production and quality of wheat, outlines key links between plant diseases, climate change and food security, and highlights key disease management issues to be addressed in improving food security in a changing climate."
climate change,"Potential impacts of projected climate change on biodiversity are often assessed using single-species bioclimatic ‘envelope’models. Such models are a special case of species distribution models in which the current geographical distribution of species is related to climatic variables so to enable projections of distributions under future climate change scenarios. This work reviews a number of critical methodological issues that may lead to uncertainty in predictions from bioclimatic modelling. Particular attention is paid to recent developments of bioclimatic modelling that address some of these issues as well as to the topics where more progress needs to be made. Developing and applying bioclimatic models in a informative way requires good understanding of a wide range of methodologies, including the choice of modelling technique, model validation, collinearity, autocorrelation, biased sampling of explanatory variables, scaling and impacts of non-climatic factors. A key challenge for future research is integrating factors such as land cover, direct CO2 effects, biotic interactions and dispersal mechanisms into species-climate models. We conclude that, although bioclimatic envelope models have a number of important advantages, they need to be applied only when users of models have a thorough understanding of their limitations and uncertainties."

climate change,"Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry includes research from selected international authors and institutions that consider land use management to be an important aspect in the context of climate change and development. Our team of editors and authors hope to add a valuable contribution to the literature to address global climate change in relation to agricultural-forestry ecosystems and development in vulnerable locations. Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry book chapters include a wide variety of topics on changes in land use practices, carbon sequestration, forest degradation, as well as polices that affect land use and development. It also includes a description of the current state of land use, land-use change and forestry in South Asian countries (Chapter 1); an evaluation of biodiversity and peoples' willingness to pay (Chapter 2); modelling of carbon sequestration in forests (Chapter 3); trade-off analysis in economic and environmental objectives (Chapter 4); use of radar imagery in detecting forest degradation (Chapter 5); assessment of carbon sequestration in woodlots (Chapter 6); solutions for improved survival of ruminants in arid and semi-arid environments and associated carbon sequestration (Chapter 7); policy interventions for land use changes (Chapter 8); accomplishing land use change from subsistence to commercial farming in Mozambique (Chapter 9); and an international and multi-sectoral approach for partnering to achieve positive agricultural developmental land use change (Chapter 10). Our team of editors, reviewers, and authors are honored to be part of this project; truly an example of international cooperation and articulation within the climate change community. The chapters and authors of Land Use, Land-Use and Forestry were carefully selected through a rigorous peer review process considering publication records, relevant and high quality contributions to this topic, and priming international cooperation. For this book and its contents, the intended audience includes the international climate change community including: contributors to the UNFCCC-IPCC process, policymakers, consultants, project developers, researchers and their institutions. Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry aims to be a valuable addition to multidisciplinary and international cooperation efforts (policies, cultural practices, new technologies, and adaptation measures), to development of land use policies, governmental and nongovernmental agencies worldwide and the general public. The editors of Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry believe the book is an effective tool to help the international community progress in understanding and management of land use changes in addressing climate change through international collaboration and cooperation."
climate change,"Processes in the climate system that can either amplify or dampen the climate response to an external perturbation are referred to as climate feedbacks. Climate sensitivity estimates depend critically on radiative feedbacks associated with water vapor, lapse rate, clouds, snow, and sea ice, and global estimates of these feedbacks differ among general circulation models. By reviewing recent observational, numerical, and theoretical studies, this paper shows that there has been progress since the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in (i) the understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in these feedbacks, (ii) the interpretation of intermodel differences in global estimates of these feedbacks, and (iii) the development of methodologies of evaluation of these feedbacks ( or of some components) using observations. This suggests that continuing developments in climate feedback research will progressively help make it possible to constrain the GCMs' range of climate feedbacks and climate sensitivity through an ensemble of diagnostics based on physical understanding and observations."
climate change,"A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on agro-ecosystems over this century is developed, up to 2080 and at a global level, albeit with significant regional detail. To this end an integrated ecological–economic modelling framework is employed, encompassing climate scenarios, agro-ecological zoning information, socio-economic drivers, as well as world food trade dynamics. Specifically, global simulations are performed using the FAO/IIASA agro-ecological zone model, in conjunction with IIASAs global food system model, using climate variables from five different general circulation models, under four different socio-economic scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. First, impacts of different scenarios of climate change on bio-physical soil and crop growth determinants of yield are evaluated on a 5′×5′ latitude/longitude global grid; second, the extent of potential agricultural land and related potential crop production is computed. The detailed bio-physical results are then fed into an economic analysis, to assess how climate impacts may interact with alternative development pathways, and key trends expected over this century for food demand and production, and trade, as well as key composite indices such as risk of hunger and malnutrition, are computed. This modelling approach connects the relevant bio-physical and socio-economic variables within a unified and coherent framework to produce a global assessment of food production and security under climate change. The results from the study suggest that critical impact asymmetries due to both climate and socio-economic structures may deepen current production and consumption gaps between developed and developing world; it is suggested that adaptation of agricultural techniques will be central to limit potential damages under climate change."
climate change,"Quantitative estimates of the economic damages of climate change usually are based on aggregate relationships linking average temperature change to loss in gross domestic product (GDP). However, there is a clear need for further detail in the regional and sectoral dimensions of impact assessments to design and prioritize adaptation strategies. New developments in regional climate modeling and physical-impact modeling in Europe allow a better exploration of those dimensions. This article quantifies the potential consequences of climate change in Europe in four market impact categories (agriculture, river floods, coastal areas, and tourism) and one nonmarket impact (human health). The methodology integrates a set of coherent, high-resolution climate change projections and physical models into an economic modeling framework. We find that if the climate of the 2080s were to occur today, the annual loss in household welfare in the European Union (EU) resulting from the four market impacts would range between 0.2–1%. If the welfare loss is assumed to be constant over time, climate change may halve the EU's annual welfare growth. Scenarios with warmer temperatures and a higher rise in sea level result in more severe economic damage. However, the results show that there are large variations across European regions. Southern Europe, the British Isles, and Central Europe North appear most sensitive to climate change. Northern Europe, on the other hand, is the only region with net economic benefits, driven mainly by the positive effects on agriculture. Coastal systems, agriculture, and river flooding are the most important of the four market impacts assessed."
climate change,"In this article, I revisit some basic issues concerning structural uncertainty and catastrophic climate change. My target audience here are general economists, so this article could also be viewed as a somewhat less technical exposition that supplements my previous work. Using empirical examples, I argue that it is implausible that low-probability, high-negative impact events would not much influence an economic analysis of climate change. I then try to integrate the empirical examples and the theory together into a unified package with a unified message that the possibility of catastrophic climate change needs to be taken seriously."
climate change,"As the rate and magnitude of climate change accelerate, understanding the consequences becomes increasingly important. Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070. Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of species in some “hotspots” of vulnerability. Differences in distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option."
climate change,"Urbanisation is estimated to result in 6 billion urban dwellers by 2050. Cities will be exposed to climate change from greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing, and localised effects from urbanisation such as the urban heat island. An urban land‐surface model has been included in the HadAM3 Global Climate Model. It shows that regions of high population growth coincide with regions of high urban heat island potential, most notably in the Middle East, the Indian sub‐continent, and East Africa. Climate change has the capacity to modify the climatic potential for urban heat islands, with increases of 30% in some locations, but a global average reduction of 6%. Warming and extreme heat events due to urbanisation and increased energy consumption are simulated to be as large as the impact of doubled CO2 in some regions, and climate change increases the disparity in extreme hot nights between rural and urban areas."
climate change,"Climate change has decreased global maize and wheat production, while soybean and rice production have remained stable. Efforts to anticipate how climate change will affect future food availability can benefit from understanding the impacts of changes to date. We found that in the cropping regions and growing seasons of most countries, with the important exception of the United States, temperature trends from 1980 to 2008 exceeded one standard deviation of historic year-to-year variability. Models that link yields of the four largest commodity crops to weather indicate that global maize and wheat production declined by 3.8 and 5.5%, respectively, relative to a counterfactual without climate trends. For soybeans and rice, winners and losers largely balanced out. Climate trends were large enough in some countries to offset a significant portion of the increases in average yields that arose from technology, carbon dioxide fertilization, and other factors."
climate change,"Rapid climate change is the defining conservation issue of our generation. The effects of climate change are increasingly apparent, from drowned coastal marshes and drying prairie potholes to melting glaciers. These climate-driven changes will profoundly affect our ability to conserve fish and wildlife and the habitats on which they depend. Indeed, preparing for and coping with the effects of climate change - an endeavor referred to as climate change adaptation - is emerging as the overarching framework for conservation and natural resource management."
climate change,"Recent studies have shown strong temporal correlations between past climate changes and societal crises. However, the specific causal mechanisms underlying this relation have not been addressed. We explored quantitative responses of 14 fine-grained agro-ecological, socioeconomic, and demographic variables to climate fluctuations from A.D. 1500–1800 in Europe. Results show that cooling from A.D. 1560–1660 caused successive agro-ecological, socioeconomic, and demographic catastrophes, leading to the General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century. We identified a set of causal linkages between climate change and human crisis. Using temperature data and climate-driven economic variables, we simulated the alternation of defined “golden” and “dark” ages in Europe and the Northern Hemisphere during the past millennium. Our findings indicate that climate change was the ultimate cause, and climate-driven economic downturn was the direct cause, of large-scale human crises in preindustrial Europe and the Northern Hemisphere."
climate change,"This paper measures the economic impact of climate change on US agricultural land. We replicate the previous literature's implementation of the hedonic approach and find that it produces estimates of the effect of climate change that are very sensitive to decisions about the appropriate control variables, sample and weighting. We find estimates of the benchmark doubling of greenhouse gases on agricultural land values that range from a decline of $420 billion (1997$) to an increase of $265 billion, or -30% to 19%. Despite its theoretical appeal, the wide variability of these estimates suggests that the hedonic method may be unreliable in this setting. In light of the potential importance of climate change, this paper proposes a new strategy to determine its economic impact. We estimate the effect of weather on farm profits, conditional on county and state by year fixed effects, so the weather parameters are identified from the presumably random variation in weather across counties within states. The results suggest that the benchmark change in climate would reduce the value of agricultural land by $40 to $80 billion, or -3% to -6%, but the null of zero effect cannot be rejected. In contrast to the hedonic approach, these results are robust to changes in specification. Since farmers can engage in a more extensive set of adaptations in response to permanent climate changes, this estimate is likely downwards biased, relative to the preferred long run effect. Together the point estimates and sign of the likely bias contradict the popular view that climate change will have substantial negative welfare consequences for the US agricultural sector."

climate change,"Abstract In this paper, the two factors controlling Northern Hemisphere springtime snow albedo feedback in transient climate change are isolated and quantified based on scenario runs of 17 climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. The first factor is the dependence of planetary albedo on surface albedo, representing the atmosphere's attenuation effect on surface albedo anomalies. It is potentially a major source of divergence in simulations of snow albedo feedback because of large differences in simulated cloud fields in Northern Hemisphere land areas. To calculate the dependence, an analytical model governing planetary albedo was developed. Detailed validations of the analytical model for two of the simulations are shown, version 3 of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory global coupled Climate Model 2.0 (CM2.0), demonstrating that it facilitates a highly accurate calculation of the dependence of plane..."
climate change,"As climate changes, the effects of forest diseases on forest ecosystems will change. We review knowledge of relationships between climate variables and several forest diseases, as well as current evidence of how climate, host and pathogen interactions are responding or might respond to climate change. Many forests can be managed to both adapt to climate change and minimize the undesirable effects of expected increases in tree mortality. We discuss four types of forest and disease management tactics – monitoring, forecasting, planning and mitigation – and provide case studies of yellow-cedar decline and sudden aspen decline to illustrate how forest diseases might be managed in the face of climate change. The uncertainties inherent to climate change effects can be diminished by conducting research, assessing risks, and linking results to forest policy, planning and decision making."

climate change,"Global climate change poses one of the greatest challenges facing humanity in this century. This article, which introduces the American Psychologist special issue on global climate change, follows from the report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on the Interface Between Psychology and Global Climate Change. In this article, we place psychological dimensions of climate change within the broader context of human dimensions of climate change by addressing (a) human causes of, consequences of, and responses (adaptation and mitigation) to climate change and (b) the links between these aspects of climate change and cognitive, affective, motivational, interpersonal, and organizational responses and processes. Characteristics of psychology that cross content domains and that make the field well suited for providing an understanding of climate change and addressing its challenges are highlighted. We also consider ethical imperatives for psychologists' involvement and provide suggestions for ways to increase psychologists' contribution to the science of climate change."

climate change,"Sea-surface warming, sea-ice melting and related freshening, changes in circulation and mixing regimes, and ocean acidification induced by the present climate changes are modifying marine ecosystem structure and function and have the potential to alter the cycling of carbon and nutrients in surface oceans. Changing climate has direct and indirect consequences on marine viruses, including cascading effects on biogeochemical cycles, food webs, and the metabolic balance of the ocean. We discuss here a range of case studies of climate change and the potential consequences on virus function, viral assemblages and virus-host interactions. In turn, marine viruses influence directly and indirectly biogeochemical cycles, carbon sequestration capacity of the oceans and the gas exchange between the ocean surface and the atmosphere. We cannot yet predict whether the viruses will exacerbate or attenuate the magnitude of climate changes on marine ecosystems, but we provide evidence that marine viruses interact actively with the present climate change and are a key biotic component that is able to influence the oceans' feedback on climate change. Long-term and wide spatial-scale studies, and improved knowledge of host-virus dynamics in the world's oceans will permit the incorporation of the viral component into future ocean climate models and increase the accuracy of the predictions of the climate change impacts on the function of the oceans."
climate change,"Despite complex regional patterns of projected climate change, significant decreases in food crop yields have been predicted using the ‘worst case’ CO2 emission scenario (A1FI) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Overall, climate change is predicted to have a progressively negative effect on the yield of food crops, particularly in the absence of efforts to mitigate global CO2 emissions. As with all species, plant pathogens will have varying responses to climate change. Whilst the life cycle of some pathogens will be limited by increasing temperatures, e.g. Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici, other climatic factors such as increasing atmospheric CO2, may provide more favourable conditions for pathogens such as Fusarium pseudograminearum. Based on published literature and unpublished work in progress, we have reviewed the qualitative effects of climate change on pathogens that cause disease of four major food crops: wheat, rice, soybean and potato. The limited data show that the influence will be positive, negative or neutral, depending on the host–pathogen interaction. Quantitative analysis of climate change on pathogens of these crops is largely lacking, either from field or laboratory studies or from modelling-based assessments. Systematic quantitative analysis of these effects will be necessary in developing future disease management plans, such as plant breeding, altered planting schedules, chemical and biological control methods and increased monitoring for new disease threats."

climate change,"The most frequently used climate classification map is that o f Wladimir Koppen, presented in its latest version 1961 by Rudolf Geiger. A huge number of climate studies and subsequent publications adopted this or a former release of the Koppen-Geiger map. While the climate classification concept has been widely applied to a broad range of topics in climate and climate change research as well as in physical geography, hydrology, agriculture, biology and educational aspects, a well-documented update of the world climate classification map is still missing. Based on recent data sets from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia and the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) at the German Weather Service, we present here a new digital Koppen-Geiger world map on climate classification, valid for the second half of the 20 th century. Zusammenfassung Die am haufigsten verwendete Klimaklassifikationskarte ist jene von Wladimir Koppen, die in der letzten Auflage von Rudolf Geiger aus dem Jahr 1961 vorliegt. Seither bildeten viele Klimabucher und Fachartikel diese oder eine fruhere Ausgabe der Koppen-Geiger Karte ab. Obwohl das Schema der Klimaklassifikation in vielen Forschungsgebieten wie Klima und Klimaanderung aber auch physikalische Geographie, Hydrologie, Landwirtschaftsforschung, Biologie und Ausbildung zum Einsatz kommt, fehlt bis heute eine gut dokumentierte Aktualisierung der Koppen-Geiger Klimakarte. Basierend auf neuesten Datensatzen des Climatic Research Unit (CRU) der Universitat von East Anglia und des Weltzentrums fur Niederschlagsklimatologie (WZN) am Deutschen Wetterdienst prasentieren wir hier eine neue digitale Koppen-Geiger Weltkarte fur die zweite Halfte des 20.

climate change,"Management decisions both at the field and off-site have the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Climate change threatens to increase the potential for soil erosion, reduce soil quality, lower agricultural productivity and negatively impact food security and global sustainability, making it one of the most severe challenges we will face in the 21st century. This paper looks at the potential of management to help us, not only mitigate climate change, but also to help us adapt to a changing climate. Different aspects of carbon management, nitrogen management, manure management, management in low-input systems (sustainable agriculture), and grazing land management are discussed as examples. Management decisions regarding conservation practices, such as no-till, conservation agriculture, and returning crop residue to the field to increase nutrient cycling, can contribute to carbon sequestration and help us mitigate and adapt to climate change. Additionally, management of grasslands, restoration of degraded/desertified lands, nitrogen management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, precision conservation management at a field and/or watershed level, and other management alternatives can also help us mitigate and/or adapt to climate change. Management for climate change mitigation and adaptation is key for environmental conservation, sustainability of cropping systems, soil and water quality, and food security. This paper suggests, based on a review of the literature, that management decisions that reduce soil erosion, increase carbon sequestration to improve soil functions, soil quality, and soil health, and contribute to the resilience of soils and cropping systems will be needed to respond to climate change and related challenges such as food security. Our review suggests that without management decisions that increase soil and water conservation, food security for the world's growing population will be harder to achieve."
climate change,"This review provides an overview of foundational climate and culture studies in anthropology; it then tracks developments in this area to date to include anthropological engagements with contemporary global climate change. Although early climate and culture studies were mainly founded in archaeology and environmental anthropology, with the advent of climate change, anthropology's roles have expanded to engage local to global contexts. Considering both the unprecedented urgency and the new level of reflexivity that climate change ushers in, anthropologists need to adopt cross-scale, multistakeholder, and interdisciplinary approaches in research and practice. I argue for one mode that anthropologists should pursue—the development of critical collaborative, multisited ethnography, which I term “climate ethnography.”"
climate change,"Aim  A major issue in ecology, biogeography, conservation biology and invasion biology is the extent to which climate, and hence climate change, contributes to the positions of species’ range boundaries. Thirty years of rapid climate warming provides an excellent opportunity to test the hypothesis that climate acts as a major constraint on range boundaries, treating anthropogenic climate change as a large‐scale experiment."
climate change,"This article addresses the nature and challenge of adaptation in the context of global climate change. The complexity of ""climate change"" as threat, environmental stressor, risk domain, and impacting process with dramatic environmental and human consequences requires a synthesis of perspectives and models from diverse areas of psychology to adequately communicate and explain how a more psychological framing of the human dimensions of global environmental change can greatly inform and enhance effective and collaborative climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and research. An integrative framework is provided that identifies and considers important mediating and moderating parameters and processes relating to climate change adaptation, with particular emphasis given to environmental stress and stress and coping perspectives. This psychological perspective on climate change adaptation highlights crucial aspects of adaptation that have been neglected in the arena of climate change science. Of particular importance are intra-individual and social ""psychological adaptation"" processes that powerfully mediate public risk perceptions and understandings, effective coping responses and resilience, overt behavioral adjustment and change, and psychological and social impacts. This psychological window on climate change adaptation is arguably indispensable to genuinely multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research and policy initiatives addressing the impacts of climate change."
climate change,"Multi-model ensembles of climate predictions constructed by running several global climate models for a common set of experiments are available for impact assessment of climate change. Multi-model ensembles emphasize the uncertainty in climate predictions resulting from structural differences in the global climate models as well as uncertainty due to variations in initial conditions or model parameterisations. This paper describes a methodology of using multi-model ensembles from global climate models for impact assessments which require local-scale climate scenarios. The approach is based on the use of a weather generator capable of generating the localscale daily climate scenarios used as an input by many process-based impact models. A new version of the LARS-WG weather generator, described in the paper, incorporates climate predictions from 15 climate models from the multi-model ensemble used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The use of the AR4 multi-model ensemble allows assessment of the range of uncertainty in the impacts of climate change resulting from the uncertainty in predications of climate. As an example, the impact of climate change on the probability of heat stress during flowering of wheat, which can result in significant yield losses, was assessed using local-scale climate scenarios in conjunction with a wheat simulation model at 4 European locations. The exploitation of much larger perturbed physics ensembles is also discussed."
climate change,"Chapter 2 emphasises change against a background of variability. The certainty of conclusions that can be drawn about climate from observations depends critically on the availability of accurate, complete and consistent series of observations. For many variables important in documenting, detecting, and attributing climate change, data are still not good enough for really firm conclusions to be reached. This especially applies to global trends in variables that have large regional variations, such as pre-"
climate change,"Current global fisheries production of ≈160 million tons is rising as a result of increases in aquaculture production. A number of climate-related threats to both capture fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have low confidence in predictions of future fisheries production because of uncertainty over future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size, and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change. Inland fisheries are additionally threatened by changes in precipitation and water management. The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events is likely to have a major impact on future fisheries production in both inland and marine systems. Reducing fishing mortality in the majority of fisheries, which are currently fully exploited or overexploited, is the principal feasible means of reducing the impacts of climate change."
climate change,"The projected global increase in the distribution and prevalence of infectious diseases with climate change suggests a pending societal crisis. The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate-change scientists, particularly with respect to malaria and other vector-transmitted human diseases. The result has been the emergence of a crisis discipline, reminiscent of the early phases of conservation biology. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate and disease along with historical and experimental evidence suggest that climate, along with many other factors, can affect infectious diseases in a nonlinear fashion. However, although the globe is significantly warmer than it was a century ago, there is little evidence that climate change has already favored infectious diseases. While initial projections suggested dramatic future increases in the geographic range of infectious diseases, recent models predict range shifts in disease distributions, with little net increase in area. Many factors can affect infectious disease, and some may overshadow the effects of climate."
climate change,"Modern complex societies exhibit marked resilience to interannual-to- decadal droughts, but cultural responses to multidecadal-to-multicentury droughts can only be addressed by integrating detailed archaeological and paleoclimatic records. Four case studies drawn from New and Old World civilizations document societal responses to prolonged drought, including population dislocations, urban abandonment, and state collapse. Further study of past cultural adaptations to persistent climate change may provide valuable perspective on possible responses of modern societies to future climate change."
climate change,"THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING: CAPITALISM VS. THE CLIMATE By Naomi Klein*Naomi Klein is a public intellectual with a passion for investigating issues affecting the public interest. She is an astute observer of how political and economic power are exercised in fashioning public policy. Klein devoted five years to research, reflection, and writing on climate change and the fossil fuel industry-to understand these phenomena, those who downplay their adverse effects (or doubt that climate change is ""man-made""), and those struggling to avoid their adverse effects on their local environs and the future of humanity. Klein concludes that what is required to avoid or mitigate the worst effects of climate change directly clashes with our prevailing capitalist, globalized, freetrade paradigms-ironically agreeing with many ""climate deniers."" Her most startling conclusion is that if humanity acts effectively to address climate change and establish a sustainable ""steady-state"" economy-which it must to survive- the oil and gas industry is doomed. The unanswered question is whether the end of that industry will leave us in a dystopian or utopian future. That question will be answered, Klein believes, and the future unalterably determined, in the next two or three years.1I. WHY DAVID MUST FIGHT GOLIATH...Klein also concludes that the source of environmental degradation, with climate change perhaps its most devastating effect, is not Western Civilization's political and economic structures, but something far deeper: its philosophic worldview. She calls this worldview the ""extractive"" attitude toward nature, and cites Francis Bacon, 17th-century scientist and philosopher, and Scottish engineer, James Watts, as two of the earliest proponents of this now prevalent view.2This book does not describe the potential disasters humanity faces from climate change; Klein assumes that most of her readers are familiar with the credible assessments of the outcomes most scientists anticipate. Klein does not assert that the supply of fossil fuels will be depleted in the near term, and force a quick transition to renewable energy and ultra-energy efficiency. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling may enable us to continue exploiting fossil fuels for the indefinite future.But Klein believes we are living in the last decade when the worst effects of global warming might still be averted. A major concern of climate scientists is whether global warming can be held to 2° Celsius (3.6° Fahrenheit), which many believe we could adapt to adequately. However, a 2011 study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a 2012 report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers show that existing trends (business as usual) put the world on track for a 4° to 6°C increase, which virtually no one thinks civilization could survive.3 Fatih Birol, the IEA's chief economist, says, ""If there is not a major international agreement on climate change by 2017, the chance of limiting the temperature rise to 2°C will be closed altogether.""4Klein notes that the world took unprecedented steps to avert a financial collapse and world-wide depression in 2008 and 2009. And there are no lack of feasible strategies for a rapid transition to non-carbon energy resources. So what, she asks, ""is really preventing us from putting out the fire that is threatening to burn down our collective house?""5We have not done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because these things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis. ""We are stuck because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe-and would benefit the vast majority-are extremely threatening to an elite minority that has a stranglehold over our economy, our political process, and most of our major media outlets.""6""The three policy pillars of this new era . . . are privatization of the public sphere, deregulation of the corporate sector, and lower corporate taxation, paid for with cuts to public spending. …"

climate change,"Introduction Formulating and implementing effective climate action in cities poses a core set of challenges for city governance. This chapter addresses the need for an empowered governance of cities worldwide, if cities and nations are to successfully confront the challenges of climate change. City governments are constrained on a number of fronts when it comes to formulating and implementing climate action. Many city governments are weakened due to only limited power over and responsibility for key public services, including planning, housing, roads and transportation systems, water, land use, drainage, waste management, and building standards resources (McCarney, 2009). In many of the poorest cities of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, informal areas of the city do not have basic services such as waste collection, piped water, storm and surface drains, and sanitation systems. While all cities and their inhabitants are at risk, the poorest cities and the most vulnerable populations are most likely to bear the greatest burden of the storms, flooding, heat waves, and other impacts anticipated to emerge from global climate change. City governments often lack powers (with respect to higher orders of government – state and national) to raise the revenues required to finance infrastructure investments and address the climate change agenda. When governance capacity is weak and constrained, cities are limited in their abilities to take programmatic action on climate change mitigation and adaptation."
climate change,"It is well known that beneficial plant-associated microorganisms may stimulate plant growth and enhance resistance to disease and abiotic stresses. The effects of climate change factors such as elevated CO(2), drought and warming on beneficial plant-microorganism interactions are increasingly being explored. This now makes it possible to test whether some general patterns occur and whether different groups of plant-associated microorganisms respond differently or in the same way to climate change. Here, we review the results of 135 studies investigating the effects of climate change factors on beneficial microorganisms and their interaction with host plants. The majority of studies showed that elevated CO(2) had a positive influence on the abundance of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas the effects on plant growth-promoting bacteria and endophytic fungi were more variable. In most cases, plant-associated microorganisms had a beneficial effect on plants under elevated CO(2). The effects of increased temperature on beneficial plant-associated microorganisms were more variable, positive and neutral, and negative effects were equally common and varied considerably with the study system and the temperature range investigated. Moreover, numerous studies indicated that plant growth-promoting microorganisms (both bacteria and fungi) positively affected plants subjected to drought stress. Overall, this review shows that plant-associated microorganisms are an important factor influencing the response of plants to climate change."
climate change,"Aim  Climate change poses significant threats to biodiversity, including impacts on species distributions, abundance and ecological interactions. At a landscape scale, these impacts, and biotic responses such as adaptation and migration, will be mediated by spatial heterogeneity in climate and climate change. We examine several aspects of the geography of climate change and their significance for biodiversity conservation."
climate change,"Most analyses treat global warning as a single-agent problem. The present study presents the Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE) model. By disaggregating into countries, the model analyzes different national strategies in climate-change policy: pure market solutions, efficient cooperative outcomes, and noncooperative equilibria. This study finds that cooperative policies show much higher levels of emissions reductions than do noncooperative strategies; that there are substantial differences in the levels of controls in both the cooperative and the noncooperative policies among different countries; and that high-income countries may be the major losers from cooperation.

climate change,"Flooding along the river Will a warming climate affect river floods? The prevailing sentiment is yes, but a consistent signal in flood magnitudes has not been found. Blöschl et al. analyzed the timing of river floods in Europe over the past 50 years and found clear patterns of changes in flood timing that can be ascribed to climate effects (see the Perspective by Slater and Wilby). These variations include earlier spring snowmelt floods in northeastern Europe, later winter floods around the North Sea and parts of the Mediterranean coast owing to delayed winter storms, and earlier winter floods in western Europe caused by earlier soil moisture maxima. Science, this issue p. 588 see also p. 552 Climate change is affecting the timing of river flooding across Europe. A warming climate is expected to have an impact on the magnitude and timing of river floods; however, no consistent large-scale climate change signal in observed flood magnitudes has been identified so far. We analyzed the timing of river floods in Europe over the past five decades, using a pan-European database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations, and found clear patterns of change in flood timing. Warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods throughout northeastern Europe; delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter floods around the North Sea and some sectors of the Mediterranean coast; and earlier soil moisture maxima have led to earlier winter floods in western Europe. Our results highlight the existence of a clear climate signal in flood observations at the continental scale."
climate change,"""Adaptation to climate change involves changes in agricultural management practices in response to changes in climate conditions. It often involves a combination of various individual responses at the farm-level and assumes that farmers have access to alternative practices and technologies available in the region. This study examines farmer adaptation strategies to climate change in Southern Africa based on a cross-section database of three countries (South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) collected as part of the Global Environment Facility/World Bank (GEF/WB) Climate Change and African Agriculture Project. The study describes farmer perceptions to changes in long-term temperature and precipitation as well as various farm-level adaptation measures and barriers to adaptation at the farm household level. A multivariate discrete choice model is used to identify the determinants of farm-level adaptation strategies. Results confirm that access to credit and extension and awareness of climate change are some of the important determinants of farm-level adaptation. An important policy message from these results is that enhanced access to credit, information (climatic and agronomic) as well as to markets (input and output) can significantly increase farm-level adaptation. Government policies should support research and development on appropriate technologies to help farmers adapt to changes in climatic conditions. Examples of such policy measures include crop development, improving climate information forecasting, and promoting appropriate farm-level adaptation measures such as use of irrigation technologies."" from Authors' Abstract"
climate change,"This paper proposes an alternative approach to addressing the complex problems of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The author, who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, argues that single policies adopted only at a global scale are unlikely to generate sufficient trust among citizens and firms so that collective action can take place in a comprehensive and transparent manner that will effectively reduce global warming. Furthermore, simply recommending a single governmental unit to solve global collective action problems is inherently weak because of free-rider problems. For example, the Carbon Development Mechanism (CDM) can be gamed in ways that hike up prices of natural resources and in some cases can lead to further natural resource exploitation. Some flaws are also noticeable in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) program. Both the CDM and REDD are vulnerable to the free-rider problem. As an alternative, the paper proposes a polycentric approach at various levels with active oversight of local, regional, and national stakeholders. Efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions are a classic collective action problem that is best addressed at multiple scales and levels. Given the slowness and conflict involved in achieving a global solution to climate change, recognizing the potential for building a more effective way of reducing green house gas emissions at multiple levels is an important step forward. A polycentric approach has the main advantage of encouraging experimental efforts at multiple levels, leading to the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one type of ecosystem and compared to results obtained in other ecosystems. Building a strong commitment to find ways of reducing individual emissions is an important element for coping with this problem, and having others also take responsibility can be more effectively undertaken in small- to medium-scale governance units that are linked together through information networks and monitoring at all levels. This paper was prepared as a background paper for the 2010 World Development Report on Climate Change."
climate change,There is a growing body of evidence which suggests that climate change could have important consequences on the hydrological cycle of South Africa - including water supply for irrigation.
climate change,"Great quantities of African dust are carried over large areas of the Atlantic and to the Caribbean during much of the year. Measurements made from 1965 to 1998 in Barbados trade winds show large interannual changes that are highly anticorrelated with rainfall in the Soudano-Sahel, a region that has suffered varying degrees of drought since 1970. Regression estimates based on long-term rainfall data suggest that dust concentrations were sharply lower during much of the 20th century before 1970, when rainfall was more normal. Because of the great sensitivity of dust emissions to climate, future changes in climate could result in large changes in emissions from African and other arid regions that, in turn, could lead to impacts on climate over large areas."
climate change,"Contemporary impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems are increasingly being recognized. Documenting the extent of these impacts requires quantitative tools for analyses of ecological observations to distinguish climate impacts in noisy data and to understand interactions between climate variability and other drivers of change. To assist the development of reliable statistical approaches, we review the marine climate change literature and provide suggestions for quantitative approaches in climate change ecology. We compiled 267 peer‐reviewed articles that examined relationships between climate change and marine ecological variables. Of the articles with time series data (n = 186), 75% used statistics to test for a dependency of ecological variables on climate variables. We identified several common weaknesses in statistical approaches, including marginalizing other important non‐climate drivers of change, ignoring temporal and spatial autocorrelation, averaging across spatial patterns and not reporting key metrics. We provide a list of issues that need to be addressed to make inferences more defensible, including the consideration of (i) data limitations and the comparability of data sets; (ii) alternative mechanisms for change; (iii) appropriate response variables; (iv) a suitable model for the process under study; (v) temporal autocorrelation; (vi) spatial autocorrelation and patterns; and (vii) the reporting of rates of change. While the focus of our review was marine studies, these suggestions are equally applicable to terrestrial studies. Consideration of these suggestions will help advance global knowledge of climate impacts and understanding of the processes driving ecological change."
climate change,"The Tibetan Plateau (TP), with an average elevation of over 4000 m asl and an area of approximately 2.5 × 106 km2, is the highest and most extensive highland in the world and has been called the ‘Third Pole’. The TP exerts a huge influence on regional and global climate through thermal and mechanical forcing mechanisms. Because the TP has the largest cryospheric extent outside the polar region and is the source region of all the large rivers in Asia, it is widely recognized to be the driving force for both regional environmental change and amplification of environmental changes on a global scale. Within China it is recognized as the ‘Asian water tower’. In this letter, we summarize the recent changes observed in climate elements and cryospheric indicators on the plateau before discussing current unresolved issues concerning climate change in the TP, including the temporal and spatial components of this change, and the consistency of change as represented by different data sources. Based on meteorological station data, reanalyses and remote sensing, the TP has shown significant warming during the last decades and will continue to warm in the future. While the warming is predominantly caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, changes in cloud amount, snow-albedo feedback, the Asian brown clouds and land use changes also partly contribute. The cryosphere in the TP is undergoing rapid change, including glacier retreat, inconsistent snow cover change, increasing permafrost temperatures and degradation, and thickening of the active layer. Hydrological processes impacted by glacial retreat have received much attention in recent years. Future attention should be paid to additional perspectives on climate change in the TP, such as the variations of climate extremes, the reliability of reanalyses and more detailed comparisons of reanalyses with surface observations. Spatial issues include the identification of whether an elevational dependency and weekend effect exist, and the identification of spatial contrasts in temperature change, along with their causes. These issues are uncertain because of a lack of reliable data above 5000 m asl."

climate change,"Current evidence suggests that inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability have a direct influence on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. This evidence has been assessed at the continental level in order to determine the possible consequences of the expected future climate change. By 2100 it is estimated that average global temperatures will have risen by 1.0-3.5 degrees C, increasing the likelihood of many vector-borne diseases in new areas. The greatest effect of climate change on transmission is likely to be observed at the extremes of the range of temperatures at which transmission occurs. For many diseases these lie in the range 14-18 degrees C at the lower end and about 35-40 degrees C at the upper end. Malaria and dengue fever are among the most important vector-borne diseases in the tropics and subtropics; Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the USA and Europe. Encephalitis is also becoming a public health concern. Health risks due to climatic changes will differ between countries that have developed health infrastructures and those that do not. Human settlement patterns in the different regions will influence disease trends. While 70% of the population in South America is urbanized, the proportion in sub-Saharan Africa is less than 45%. Climatic anomalies associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon and resulting in drought and floods are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. They have been linked to outbreaks of malaria in Africa, Asia and South America. Climate change has far-reaching consequences and touches on all life-support systems. It is therefore a factor that should be placed high among those that affect human health and survival."
climate change,"The magnitude of future climate change depends substantially on the greenhouse gas emission pathways we choose. Here we explore the implications of the highest and lowest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions pathways for climate change and associated impacts in California. Based on climate projections from two state-of-the-art climate models with low and medium sensitivity (Parallel Climate Model and Hadley Centre Climate Model, version 3, respectively), we find that annual temperature increases nearly double from the lower B1 to the higher A1fi emissions scenario before 2100. Three of four simulations also show greater increases in summer temperatures as compared with winter. Extreme heat and the associated impacts on a range of temperature-sensitive sectors are substantially greater under the higher emissions scenario, with some interscenario differences apparent before midcentury. By the end of the century under the B1 scenario, heatwaves and extreme heat in Los Angeles quadruple in frequency while heat-related mortality increases two to three times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 50-75%; and Sierra snowpack is reduced 30-70%. Under A1fi, heatwaves in Los Angeles are six to eight times more frequent, with heat-related excess mortality increasing five to seven times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 75-90%; and snowpack declines 73-90%, with cascading impacts on runoff and streamflow that, combined with projected modest declines in winter precipitation, could fundamentally disrupt California's water rights system. Although interscenario differences in climate impacts and costs of adaptation emerge mainly in the second half of the century, they are strongly dependent on emissions from preceding decades."
climate change,"A longer growing season as a result of climate change will in turn affect climate through biogeochemical and biophysical effects. Climate warming has advanced the biological spring and delayed the arrival of biological winter (1, 2). These changes in the annual cycle of plants and the lengthening of the green-cover season have many consequences for ecological processes, agriculture, forestry, human health, and the global economy (3). Studies on vegetation-atmosphere interactions (4) and particularly on the impact of leaf emergence on climate (5–9) suggest that the phenological shifts in turn affect climate. The magnitude and sign of this effect are unknown but depend on water availability and regional characteristics."

climate change,"Current rates of climate change are unprecedented, and biological responses to these changes have also been rapid at the levels of ecosystems, communities, and species. Most research on climate change effects on biodiversity has concentrated on the terrestrial realm, and considerable changes in terrestrial biodiversity and species’ distributions have already been detected in response to climate change. The studies that have considered organisms in the freshwater realm have also shown that freshwater biodiversity is highly vulnerable to climate change, with extinction rates and extirpations of freshwater species matching or exceeding those suggested for better‐known terrestrial taxa. There is some evidence that freshwater species have exhibited range shifts in response to climate change in the last millennia, centuries, and decades. However, the effects are typically species‐specific, with cold‐water organisms being generally negatively affected and warm‐water organisms positively affected. However, detected range shifts are based on findings from a relatively low number of taxonomic groups, samples from few freshwater ecosystems, and few regions. The lack of a wider knowledge hinders predictions of the responses of much of freshwater biodiversity to climate change and other major anthropogenic stressors. Due to the lack of detailed distributional information for most freshwater taxonomic groups and the absence of distribution‐climate models, future studies should aim at furthering our knowledge about these aspects of the ecology of freshwater organisms. Such information is not only important with regard to the basic ecological issue of predicting the responses of freshwater species to climate variables, but also when assessing the applied issue of the capacity of protected areas to accommodate future changes in the distributions of freshwater species. This is a huge challenge, because most current protected areas have not been delineated based on the requirements of freshwater organisms. Thus, the requirements of freshwater organisms should be taken into account in the future delineation of protected areas and in the estimation of the degree to which protected areas accommodate freshwater biodiversity in the changing climate and associated environmental changes."
climate change,"Public risk perceptions can fundamentally compel or constrain political, economic, and social action to address particular risks. Public support or opposition to climate policies (e.g., treaties, regulations, taxes, subsidies) will be greatly influenced by public perceptions of the risks and dangers posed by global climate change. This article describes results from a national study (2003) that examined the risk perceptions and connotative meanings of global warming in the American mind and found that Americans perceived climate change as a moderate risk that will predominantly impact geographically and temporally distant people and places. This research also identified several distinct interpretive communities, including naysayers and alarmists, with widely divergent perceptions of climate change risks. Thus, “dangerous” climate change is a concept contested not only among scientists and policymakers, but among the American public as well."

climate change,"Although bioclimatic modelling is often used to estimate potential impacts of likely climate changes, little has been done to assess the reliability and variability of projections. Here, using four niche‐based models, two methods to derive probability values from models into presence–absence data and five climate change scenarios, I project the future potential habitats of 1350 European plant species for 2050. All 40 different projections of species turnover across Europe suggested high potential species turnover (up to 70%) in response to climate change. However variability in the potential distributional changes of species across climate scenarios was obscured by a strong variability in projections arising from alternative, yet equally justifiable, niche‐based models. Therefore, projections of future species distributions and derived community descriptors cannot be reliably discussed unless model uncertainty is quantified explicitly. I propose and test an alternative way to account for modelling variability when deriving estimates of species turnover (with and without dispersal) according to a range of climate change scenarios representing various socio‐economic futures."
climate change,"Research in the effects of climate change on plant disease continues to be limited, but some striking progress has been made. At the genomic level, advances in technologies for the high-throughput analysis of gene expression have made it possible to begin discriminating responses to different biotic and abiotic stressors and potential trade-offs in responses. At the scale of the individual plant, enough experiments have been performed to begin synthesizing the effects of climate variables on infection rates, though pathosystem-specific characteristics make synthesis challenging. Models of plant disease have now been developed to incorporate more sophisticated climate predictions. At the population level, the adaptive potential of plant and pathogen populations may prove to be one of the most important predictors of the magnitude of climate change effects. Ecosystem ecologists are now addressing the role of plant disease in ecosystem processes and the challenge of scaling up from individual infection probabilities to epidemics and broader impacts."
climate change,"A suite of climate change indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation data, with a primary focus on extreme events, were computed and analyzed. By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951-2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901-2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901-1950, 1951-1978 and 1979-2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century."
climate change,"Summary 
Climate change effects on seasonal activity in terrestrial ecosystems are significant and well documented, especially in the middle and higher latitudes. Temperature is a main driver of many plant developmental processes, and in many cases higher temperatures have been shown to speed up plant development and lead to earlier switching to the next ontogenetic stage. Qualitatively consistent advancement of vegetation activity in spring has been documented using three independent methods, based on ground observations, remote sensing, and analysis of the atmospheric CO2 signal. However, estimates of the trends for advancement obtained using the same method differ substantially. We propose that a high fraction of this uncertainty is related to the time frame analysed and changes in trends at decadal time scales. Furthermore, the correlation between estimates of the initiation of spring activity derived from ground observations and remote sensing at interannual time scales is often weak. We propose that this is caused by qualitative differences in the traits observed using the two methods, as well as the mixture of different ecosystems and species within the satellite scenes."

climate change,"Climate change is generating complex responses in both natural and human ecosystems that vary in their geographic distribution, magnitude, and timing across the global landscape. One of the major issues that scientists and policy makers now confront is how to assess such massive changes over multiple scales of space and time. Lakes and reservoirs comprise a geographically distributed network of the lowest points in the surrounding landscape that make them important sentinels of climate change. Their physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate provide a variety of information‐rich signals. Their sediments archive and integrate these signals, enabling paleolimnologists to document changes over years to millennia. Lakes are also hot spots of carbon cycling in the landscape and as such are important regulators of climate change, processing terrestrial and atmospheric as well as aquatic carbon. We provide an overview of this concept of lakes and reservoirs as sentinels, integrators, and regulators of climate change, as well as of the need for scaling and modeling these responses in the context of global climate change. We conclude by providing a brief look to the future and the creation of globally networked sensors in lakes and reservoirs around the world."
climate change,"The Torreya Guardians are trying to save the Florida torreya (Torreya taxifolia Arn.) from extinction (Barlow & Martin 2004). Fewer than 1000 individuals of this coniferous tree remain within its native distribution, a 35-km stretch of the Apalachicola River, and these trees are not reproducing (Schwartz et al. 2000). Even if the Florida torreya was not declining toward extinction, the species would be at risk from climate change. Warming is projected to either significantly reduce or eliminate suitable habitat for most narrowly endemic taxa (Thomas et al. 2004; Hannah et al. 2005; Peterson et al. 2006), forcing species to colonize new terrain to survive. The focus of the Torreya Guardians is an “assisted migration” program that would introduce seedlings to forests across the Southern Appalachians and Cumberland Plateau (http://www.TorreyaGuardians.org). Their intent is to avert extinction by deliberately expanding the range of this endangered plant over 500 km northward. Because planting endangered plants in new environments is relatively simple as long as seeds are legally acquired and planted with landowner permission, the Torreya Guardians believe their efforts are justified. Introducing this species to regions where it has not existed for 65 million years is “[e]asy, legal, and cheap” (Barlow & Martin 2004). If circumventing climate-driven extinction is a conservation priority, then assisted migration must be considered a management option. Compelling evidence suggests that climate change will be a significant driver of extinction (McCarthy et al. 2001; McLaughlin et al. 2002; Root et al. 2003; Thomas et al. 2004). Researchers typically conclude that mitigating climate change and providing reserve networks that foster connectivity and movement should be a priority (e.g., Hannah et al. 2002). Ecol-"
climate change,"Plant phenology is strongly controlled by climate and has consequently become one of the most reliable bioindicators of ongoing climate change. We used a dataset of more than 200 000 records for six phenological events of 29 perennial plant species monitored from 1943 to 2003 for a comprehensive assessment of plant phenological responses to climate change in the Mediterranean region. Temperature, precipitation and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) were studied together during a complete annual cycle before phenological events to determine their relative importance and potential seasonal carry‐over effects. Warm and dry springs under a positive phase of NAO advance flowering, leaf unfolding and fruiting dates and lengthen the growing season. Spatial variability of dates (range among sites) was also reduced during warm and dry years, especially for spring events. Climate during previous weeks to phenophases occurrence had the greatest impact on plants, although all events were also affected by climate conditions several months before. Immediate along with delayed climate effects suggest dual triggers in plant phenology. Climatic models accounted for more than 80% of variability in flowering and leaf unfolding dates, and in length of the growing season, but for lower proportions in fruiting and leaf falling. Most part of year‐to‐year changes in dates was accounted for temperature, while precipitation and NAO accounted for <10% of dates' variability. In the case of flowering, insect‐pollinated species were better modelled by climate than wind‐pollinated species. Differences in temporal responses of plant phenology to recent climate change are due to differences in the sensitivity to climate among events and species. Spring events are changing more than autumn events as they are more sensitive to climate and are also undergoing the greatest alterations of climate relative to other seasons. In conclusion, climate change has shifted plant phenology in the Mediterranean region."
climate change,"Values play a significant role in climate change debates. To date, however, the use of the term values has been narrowly focused on monetary worth, relative worth, or fair return on exchanges. This article argues that another, broader interpretation of values, one concentrating on intrinsically desirable principles or qualities is needed to understand and respond to climate change. How to respond to climate change impacts depends importantly on what the effects of climate change mean to those affected. Similarly, what is considered as effective and legitimate adaptation depends on what people perceive to be worth preserving and achieving. How to adapt to climate change therefore hinges on the values underlying people's perspectives on what the goals of adaptation should be. This article examines what a values‐based approach is, why it is needed, and what its benefits for understanding adaptation are. The implications for research and policy are discussed.

climate change,"The weight of scientific evidence tells us that Australians are facing risks of damaging climate change. The risk can be substantially reduced by strong, effective and early action by all major economies. Australia will need to play its full proportionate part in global action. As one of the developed countries, its full part will be relatively large, and involve major early changes to established economic structure. The work of the Review shows that the costs of Australia playing its proportionate part in an effective global effort, while considerable, are manageable. There is a path to Australia being a low-emissions economy by the middle of the 21st century, consistently with continuing strong growth in material living standards. By the end of the 21st century, and beyond, more so with each passing decade material living standards would be higher with than without mitigation of climate change.

climate change,"Climate change communication has become a salient topic in science and society. It has grown to be something like a booming industry alongside more established ‘communication enterprises’, such as health communication, risk communication, and science communication. This article situates the theory of climate change communication within theoretical developments in the field of science communication. It discusses the importance and difficulties inherent in talking about climate change to different types of publics using various types of communication tools and strategies. It engages with the difficult issue of the relationship between climate change communication and behavior change, and it focuses, in particular, on the role of language (metaphors, words, strategies, frames, and narratives) in conveying climate change issues to stakeholders. In the process, it attempts to provide an overview of emerging theories of climate change communication, theories that recently have begun to proliferate quite dramatically. In some cases, we can, therefore only provide signposts to the most relevant research that is being carried out with regard to climate change communication without being able to engage with all its aspects. We end with an assessment of how communication could be improved in light of the theories and practices discussed in this article. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
climate change,"Abstract This article discusses the mitigation and adaptation potential of organic agricultural systems along three main features: farming system design, cropland management and grassland and livestock management. An important potential contribution of organically managed systems to climate change mitigation is identified in the careful management of nutrients and, hence, the reduction of N2O emissions from soils. Another high mitigation potential of organic agriculture lies in carbon sequestration in soils. In a first estimate, the emission reduction potential by abstention from mineral fertilizers is calculated to be about 20% and the compensation potential by carbon sequestration to be about 40–72% of the world's current annual agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but further research is needed to consolidate these numbers. On the adaptation side, organic agriculture systems have a strong potential for building resilient food systems in the face of uncertainties, through farm diversification and building soil fertility with organic matter. Additionally, organic agriculture offers alternatives to energy-intensive production inputs such as synthetic fertilizers which are likely to be further limited for poor rural populations by rising energy prices. In developing countries, organic agricultural systems achieve equal or even higher yields, as compared to the current conventional practices, which translate into a potentially important option for food security and sustainable livelihoods for the rural poor in times of climate change. Certified organic products cater for higher income options for farmers and, therefore, can serve as promoters for climate-friendly farming practices worldwide."
climate change,"Problem: Even if significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions are achieved, some amount of climate change appears to be inevitable. Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review. Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development, habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency coordination and new laws and regulations. Takeaway for practice: Local and regional planners can help society adapt to a changing climate by using the best available science, deciding on goals and early actions, locating relevant partners, identifying and eliminating regulatory barriers, and encouraging the introduction of new state mandates and guidelines. Research support: Partial support for this research was provided by Pacific Gas and Electric, The Nature Conservancy, and Next 10."
climate change,"The climate of the western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is undergoing a transition from a cold-dry polar-type climate to a warm-humid sub-Antarctic–type climate. Using three decades of satellite and field data, we document that ocean biological productivity, inferred from chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), has significantly changed along the WAP shelf. Summertime surface Chl a (summer integrated Chl a ∼63% of annually integrated Chl a) declined by 12% along the WAP over the past 30 years, with the largest decreases equatorward of 63°S and with substantial increases in Chl a occurring farther south. The latitudinal variation in Chl a trends reflects shifting patterns of ice cover, cloud formation, and windiness affecting water-column mixing. Regional changes in phytoplankton coincide with observed changes in krill (Euphausia superba) and penguin populations."
climate change,"This article highlights how the loose definition of the term ‘refugia’ has led to discrepancies in methods used to assess the vulnerability of species to the current trend of rising global temperatures. The term ‘refugia’ is commonly used without distinguishing between macrorefugia and microrefugia, ex situ refugia and in situ refugia, glacial and interglacial refugia or refugia based on habitat stability and refugia based on climatic stability. It is not always clear which definition is being used, and this makes it difficult to assess the appropriateness of the methods employed. For example, it is crucial to develop accurate fine‐scale climate grids when identifying microrefugia, but coarse‐scale macroclimate might be adequate for determining macrorefugia. Similarly, identifying in situ refugia might be more appropriate for species with poor dispersal ability but this may overestimate the extinction risk for good dispersers. More care needs to be taken to properly define the context when referring to refugia from climate change so that the validity of methods and the conservation significance of refugia can be assessed."
climate change,"Abstract The high Himalayan mountains in the north of India are important sources for generating and maintaining the climate over the entire northern belt of the Indian subcontinent. They also influence extreme weather events, such as the western disturbances over the region during winter. The work presented here describes some current trends in weather and climate over the western Himalaya and suggests some possible explanations in the context of climate change. The work also shows how the special features of Indian orography in the western Himalaya affect climate change in the long term, changing the pattern of precipitation over the region. Data analysis of different ranges of the western Himalaya shows significant variations in temperature and snowfall trends in the past few decades. Possible explanations for the changing climate over the western Himalaya are proposed, in terms of variations in cloudiness. The possible effects of climate change on the number of snowfall days and the occurrences of western disturbances over the western Himalaya are also analysed."
climate change,"The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest."
climate change,"This paper produces the first large-scale estimates of the US health related welfare costs due to climate change. Using the presumably random year-to-year variation in temperature and two state of the art climate models, the analysis suggests that under a ""business as usual"" scenario climate change will lead to an increase in the overall US annual mortality rate ranging from 0.5% to 1.7% by the end of the 21st century. These overall estimates are statistically indistinguishable from zero, although there is evidence of statistically significant increases in mortality rates for some subpopulations, particularly infants. As the canonical Becker-Grossman health production function model highlights, the full welfare impact will be reflected in health outcomes and increased consumption of goods that preserve individuals' health. Individuals' likely first compensatory response is increased use of air conditioning; the analysis indicates that climate change would increase US annual residential energy consumption by a statistically significant 15% to 30% ($15 to $35 billion in 2006 dollars) at the end of the century. It seems reasonable to assume that the mortality impacts would be larger without the increased energy consumption. Further, the estimated mortality and energy impacts likely overstate the long-run impacts on these outcomes, since individuals can engage in a wider set of adaptations in the longer run to mitigate costs. Overall, the analysis suggests that the health related welfare costs of higher temperatures due to climate change are likely to be quite modest in the US."

climate change,"Climate change poses grave threats to many people, including the most vulnerable. This prompts the question of who should bear the burden of combating ‘dangerous’ climate change. Many appeal to the Polluter Pays Principle. I argue that it should play an important role in any adequate analysis of the responsibility to combat climate change, but suggest that it suffers from three limitations and that it needs to be revised. I then consider the Ability to Pay Principle and consider four objections to this principle. I suggest that, when suitably modified, it can supplement the Polluter Pays Principle."
climate change,"Zoonotic tick-borne diseases are an increasing health burden in Europe and there is speculation that this is partly due to climate change affecting vector biology and disease transmission. Data on the vector tick Ixodes ricinus suggest that an extension of its northern and altitude range has been accompanied by an increased prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis. Climate change may also be partly responsible for the change in distribution of Dermacentor reticulatus. Increased winter activity of I. ricinus is probably due to warmer winters and a retrospective study suggests that hotter summers will change the dynamics and pattern of seasonal activity, resulting in the bulk of the tick population becoming active in the latter part of the year. Climate suitability models predict that eight important tick species are likely to establish more northern permanent populations in a climate-warming scenario. However, the complex ecology and epidemiology of such tick-borne diseases as Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis make it difficult to implicate climate change as the main cause of their increasing prevalence. Climate change models are required that take account of the dynamic biological processes involved in vector abundance and pathogen transmission in order to predict future tick-borne disease scenarios."
climate change,"Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [United Nations (1992) http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf. Accessed February 9, 2009] commits signatory nations to stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that “would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI) with the climate system.” In an effort to provide some insight into impacts of climate change that might be considered DAI, authors of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified 5 “reasons for concern” (RFCs). Relationships between various impacts reflected in each RFC and increases in global mean temperature (GMT) were portrayed in what has come to be called the “burning embers diagram.” In presenting the “embers” in the TAR, IPCC authors did not assess whether any single RFC was more important than any other; nor did they conclude what level of impacts or what atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases would constitute DAI, a value judgment that would be policy prescriptive. Here, we describe revisions of the sensitivities of the RFCs to increases in GMT and a more thorough understanding of the concept of vulnerability that has evolved over the past 8 years. This is based on our expert judgment about new findings in the growing literature since the publication of the TAR in 2001, including literature that was assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), as well as additional research published since AR4. Compared with results reported in the TAR, smaller increases in GMT are now estimated to lead to significant or substantial consequences in the framework of the 5 “reasons for concern.”"
climate change,"There are two main uncertainties in determining future climate: the trajectories of future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and the response of the global climate system to any given set of future emissions [Meehl et al., 2007]. These uncertainties normally are elucidated via application of global climate models, which provide information at relatively coarse spatial resolutions. Greater interest in, and concern about, the details of climate change at regional scales has provided the motivation for the application of regional climate models, which introduces additional uncertainty [Christensen et al., 2007a]. These uncertainties in fi ne- scale regional climate responses, in contrast to uncertainties of coarser spatial resolution global models in which regional models are nested, now have been documented in numerous contexts [Christensen et al., 2007a] and have been found to extend to uncertainties in climate impacts [Wood et al., 2004; Oleson et al., 2007]. While European research in future climate projections has moved forward systematically to examine combined uncertainties from global and regional models [Christensen et al., 2007b], North American climate programs have lagged behind. To fi ll this research gap, scientists developed the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (-NARCCAP). The fundamental scientifi c motivation of thismore » international program is to explore separate and combined uncertainties in regional projections of future climate change resulting from the use of multiple atmosphere- ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) to drive multiple regional climate models (RCMs). An equally important, and related, motivation for this program is to provide the climate impacts and adaptation community with high- resolution regional climate change scenarios that can be used for studies of the societal impacts of climate change and possible adaptation strategies.« less"
climate change,"Migration is one of the variety of ways by which human populations adapt to environmental changes. The study of migration in the context of anthropogenic climate change is often approached using the concept of vulnerability and its key functional elements: exposure, system sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. This article explores the interaction of climate change and vulnerability through review of case studies of dry‐season migration in the West African Sahel, hurricane‐related population displacements in the Caribbean basin, winter migration of ‘snowbirds’ to the US Sun‐belt, and 1930s drought migration on the North American Great Plains. These examples are then used as analogues for identifying general causal, temporal, and spatial dimensions of climate migration, along with potential considerations for policy‐making and future research needs.

climate change,"This paper develops a framework for the study of climate on fish populations based on first principles of physiology, ecology, and available observations. Environmental variables and oceanographic features that are relevant to fish and that are likely to be affected by climate change are reviewed. Working hypotheses are derived from the differences in the expected response of different species groups. A review of published data on Northeast Atlantic fish species representing different biogeographic affinities, habitats, and body size lends support to the hypothesis that global warming results in a shift in abundance and distribution (in patterns of occurrence with latitude and depth) of fish species. Pelagic species exhibit clear changes in seasonal migration patterns related to climateinduced changes in zooplankton productivity. Lusitanian species have increased in recent decades (sprat, anchovy, and horse mackerel), especially at the northern limit of their distribution areas, while Boreal species decreased at the southern limit of their distribution range (cod and plaice), but increased at the northern limit (cod). Although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, available evidence suggests climate-related changes in recruitment success to be the key process, stemming from either higher production or survival in the pelagic egg or larval stage, or owing to changes in the quality/quantity of nursery habitats."
climate change,"Although much has been written about climate change and poverty as distinct and complex problems, the link between them has received little attention. Understanding this link is vital for the formulation of effective policy responses to climate change. This paper focuses on agriculture as a primary means by which the impacts of climate change are transmitted to the poor, and as a sector at the forefront of climate change mitigation efforts in developing countries. In so doing, the paper offers some important insights that may help shape future policies as well as ongoing research in this area."

climate change,"An overview is provided of the observed and potential future responses of zooplankton communities to global warming. I begin by describing the importance of zooplankton in ocean ecosystems and the attributes that make them sensitive beacons of climate change. Global warming may have even greater repercussions for marine ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems, because temperature influences water column stability, nutrient enrichment, and the degree of new production, and thus the abundance, size composition, diversity, and trophic efficiency of zooplankton. Pertinent descriptions of physical changes in the ocean in response to climate change are given as a prelude to a detailed discussion of observed impacts of global warming on zooplankton. These manifest as changes in the distribution of individual species and assemblages, in the timing of important life-cycle events, and in abundance and community structure. The most illustrative case studies, where climate has had an obvious, tangible impact on zooplankton and substantial ecosystem consequences, are presented. Changes in the distribution and phenology of zooplankton are faster and greater than those observed for terrestrial groups. Relevant projected changes in ocean conditions are then presented, followed by an exploration of potential future changes in zooplankton communities from the perspective of different modelling approaches. Researchers have used a range of modelling approaches on individual species and functional groups forced by output from climate models under future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. I conclude by suggesting some potential future directions in climate change research for zooplankton, viz. the use of richer zooplankton functional groups in ecosystem models; greater research effort in tropical systems; investigating climate change in conjunction with other human impacts; and a global zooplankton observing system."
climate change,"Regional or local climate change modeling studies currently require starting with a global climate model, then downscaling to the region of interest. How should global models be chosen for such studies, and what effect do such choices have? This question is addressed in the context of a regional climate detection and attribution (D&A) study of January-February-March (JFM) temperature over the western U.S. Models are often selected for a regional D&A analysis based on the quality of the simulated regional climate. Accordingly, 42 performance metrics based on seasonal temperature and precipitation, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are constructed and applied to 21 global models. However, no strong relationship is found between the score of the models on the metrics and results of the D&A analysis. Instead, the importance of having ensembles of runs with enough realizations to reduce the effects of natural internal climate variability is emphasized. Also, the superiority of the multimodel ensemble average (MM) to any 1 individual model, already found in global studies examining the mean climate, is true in this regional study that includes measures of variability as well. Evidence is shown that this superiority is largely caused by the cancellation of offsetting errors in the individual global models. Results with both the MM and models picked randomly confirm the original D&A results of anthropogenically forced JFM temperature changes in the western U.S. Future projections of temperature do not depend on model performance until the 2080s, after which the better performing models show warmer temperatures."
climate change,"One of the major concerns with a potential change in climate is that an increase in extreme events will occur. Results of observational studies suggest that in many areas that have been analyzed, changes in total precipitation are amplified at the tails, and changes in some temperature extremes have been observed. Model output has been analyzed that shows changes in extreme events for future climates, such as increases in extreme high temperatures, decreases in extreme low temperatures, and increases in intense precipitation events. In addition, the societal infrastructure is becoming more sensitive to weather and climate extremes, which would be exacerbated by climate change. In wild plants and animals, climate-induced extinctions, distributional and phenological changes, and species' range shifts are being documented at an increasing rate. Several apparently gradual biological changes are linked to responses to extreme weather and climate events."
climate change,"Abstract The Antarctic climate system varies on timescales from orbital, through millennial to sub-annual, and is closely coupled to other parts of the global climate system. We review these variations from the perspective of the geological and glaciological records and the recent historical period from which we have instrumental data (∼the last 50 years). We consider their consequences for the biosphere, and show how the latest numerical models project changes into the future, taking into account human actions in the form of the release of greenhouse gases and chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere. In doing so, we provide an essential Southern Hemisphere companion to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment."
climate change,"There is an increasing consensus that global climate change occurs and that potential changes in climate are likely to have important regional consequences for biota and ecosystems. Ecological restoration, including (re)afforestation and rehabilitation of degraded land, is included in the array of potential human responses to climate change. However, the implications of climate change for the broader practice of ecological restoration must be considered. In particular, the usefulness of historical ecosystem conditions as targets and references must be set against the likelihood that restoring these historic ecosystems is unlikely to be easy, or even possible, in the changed biophysical conditions of the future. We suggest that more consideration and debate needs to be directed at the implications of climate change for restoration practice."
climate change,"The research reported here examines the relationship between risk perceptions and willingness to address climate change. The data are a national sample of 1225 mail surveys that include measures of risk perceptions and knowledge tied to climate change, support for voluntary and government actions to address the problem, general environmental beliefs, and demographic variables. Risk perceptions matter in predicting behavioral intentions. Risk perceptions are not a surrogate for general environmental beliefs, but have their own power to account for behavioral intentions. There are four secondary conclusions. First, behavioral intentions regarding climate change are complex and intriguing. People are neither “nonbelievers” who will take no initiatives themselves and oppose all government efforts, nor are they “believers” who promise both to make personal efforts and to vote for every government proposal that promises to address climate change. Second, there are separate demographic sources for voluntary actions compared with voting intentions. Third, recognizing the causes of global warming is a powerful predictor of behavioral intentions independent from believing that climate change will happen and have bad consequences. Finally, the success of the risk perception variables to account for behavioral intentions should encourage greater attention to risk perceptions as independent variables. Risk perceptions and knowledge, however, share the stage with general environmental beliefs and demographic characteristics. Although related, risk perceptions, knowledge, and general environmental beliefs are somewhat independent predictors of behavioral intentions."
climate change,"Abstract:  The scientific literature contains numerous descriptions of observed and potential effects of global climate change on species and ecosystems. In response to anticipated effects of climate change, conservation organizations and government agencies are developing “adaptation strategies” to facilitate the adjustment of human society and ecological systems to altered climate regimes. We reviewed the literature and climate‐change adaptation plans that have been developed in United States, Canada, England, México, and South Africa and found 16 general adaptation strategies that relate directly to the conservation of biological diversity. These strategies can be grouped into four broad categories: land and water protection and management; direct species management; monitoring and planning; and law and policy. Tools for implementing these strategies are similar or identical to those already in use by conservationists worldwide (land and water conservation, ecological restoration, agrienvironment schemes, species translocation, captive propagation, monitoring, natural resource planning, and legislation/regulation). Although our review indicates natural resource managers already have many tools that can be used to address climate‐change effects, managers will likely need to apply these tools in novel and innovative ways to meet the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change."
climate change,"Biological invasions into wholly new regions are a consequence of a far reaching but underappreciated component of global environmental change, the human-caused breakdown of biogeographic barriers to species dispersal . Human activity moves species from place to place both accidentally and deliberately-and it does so at rates that are without precedent in the last tens of millions of years. As a result , taxa that evolved in isolation from each other are being forced into contact in an instant of evolutionary time. This human-caused breakdown of barriers to dispersal sets in motion changes that may seem less important than the changing composition of the atmosphere , climate change , or tropical deforestation-but they are significant for several reasons. First , to date , biological invasions have caused more species extinctions than have resulted from human-caused climatic change or the changing composition of the atmosphere . Only land use change probably has caused more extinction, and (as we later discuss) land use change interacts strongly with biological invasions. Second, the effects of human-caused biological invasions are long-term: changes in climate, the atmosphere, and land use may be reversible in hundreds to thousands of years, but the breakdown of biogeographic barriers has resulted in self-maintaining and evolving"

climate change,"We review recent research of importance to understanding crop and pasture plant species response to climate change. Topics include plant response to elevated CO2 concentration, interactions with climate change variables and air pollutants, impacts of increased climate variability and frequency of extreme events, the role of weeds and pests, disease and animal health, issues in biodiversity, and vulnerability of soil carbon pools. We critically analyze the links between fundamental knowledge at the plant and plot level and the additional socio-economic variables that determine actual production and trade of food at regional to global scales. We conclude by making recommendations for current and future research needs, with a focus on continued and improved integration of experimental and modeling efforts."
climate change,"Climate change is widely acknowledged as foremost among the formidable challenges facing the international community in the 21st century. It poses challenges to fundamental elements of our understanding of appropriate goals for social and economic policy, such as the connection of prosperity, growth, equity, and sustainable development. This volume seeks to establish an agenda for research and action built on an enhanced understanding of the relationship between climate change and the key social dimensions of vulnerability, social justice, and equity. The volume is organized as follows. This introductory chapter first sets the scene by framing climate change as an issue of social justice at multiple levels, and by highlighting equity and vulnerability as the central organizing themes of an agenda on the social dimensions of climate change. Chapter two leads off with a review of existing theories and frameworks for understanding vulnerability, drawing out implications for pro-poor climate policy. Understanding the multilayered causal structure of vulnerability then can assist in identifying entry points for pro-poor climate policy at multiple levels. Building on such analytical approaches, chapters three and four, respectively, consider the implications of climate change for armed conflict and for migration. Those chapters are followed by a discussion of two of the most important social cleavages that characterize distinct forms of vulnerability to climate change and climate action: gender (chapter five) and ethnicity or indigenous identity (chapter six), in the latter case, focusing on the role of indigenous knowledge in crafting climate response measures in the Latin American and Caribbean region. Chapter seven highlights the important mediating role of local institutions in achieving more equitable, pro-poor outcomes from efforts to support adaptation to climate change. Chapter eight examines the implications of climate change for agrarian societies living in dry-land areas of the developing world, and chapter nine does the same for those living in urban centers. Chapter ten considers the role of social policy instruments in supporting pro-poor adaptation to climate change; and it argues for a focus on 'no-regrets' options that integrate adaptation with existing development approaches, albeit with modifications to take better account of the ways in which climate variables interact with other drivers of vulnerability. Finally, chapter eleven turns to the implications of climate policy and action for forest areas and forest people."
climate change,"Plant respiration is a large, environmentally sensitive component of the ecosystem carbon balance, and net ecosystem carbon flux will change as the balance between photosynthesis and respiration changes. Partitioning respiration into the functional components of construction, maintenance, and ion uptake will aid the estimation of plant respiration for ecosystems. Maintenance respiration is the component most sensitive to changes in temperature, CO2 , protein concentration and turnover, water stress, and atmospheric pollutants. For a wide variety of plant tissues, maintenance respiration, corrected for temperature, appears to be linearly related to Kjeldahl nitrogen content of live tissue. Total and maintenance respiration may decline under CO2 enrichment, but the mechanism, independence from changes in protein content, and acclimation are unknown. Response of respiration to temperature can be modelled as a Q10 relationship, if corrections for bias arising from daily and annual temperature amplitude are applied. Occurrence and control of the cyanide-resistant respiratory pathway and acclimation of respiration rates to different climates are poorly understood, but may substantially affect the reliability of model estimates of plant respiration."
climate change,"The projected global increase in the distribution and prevalence of infectious diseases with climate change suggests a pending societal crisis. The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate-change scientists, particularly with respect to malaria and other vector-transmitted human diseases. The result has been the emergence of a crisis discipline, reminiscent of the early phases of conservation biology. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate and disease along with historical and experimental evidence suggest that climate, along with many other factors, can affect infectious diseases in a nonlinear fashion. However, although the globe is significantly warmer than it was a century ago, there is little evidence that climate change has already favored infectious diseases. While initial projections suggested dramatic future increases in the geographic range of infectious diseases, recent models predict range shifts in disease distributions, with little net increase in area. Many factors can affect infectious disease, and some may overshadow the effects of climate."
climate change,"Rain-fed agriculture will remain the dominant source of staple food production and the livelihood foundation of the majority of the rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Greatly enhanced investment in agriculture by a broad range of stakeholders will be required if this sector is to meet the food security requirements of tomorrow’s Africa. However, production uncertainty associated with between and within season rainfall variability remains a fundamental constraint to many investors who often over estimate the negative impacts of climate induced uncertainty. Climate change is likely to make matters worse with increases in rainfall variability being predicted. The ability of agricultural communities and agricultural stakeholders in SSA to cope better with the constraints and opportunities of current climate variability must first be enhanced for them to be able to adapt to climate change and the predicted future increase in climate variability. Tools and approaches are now available that allow for a better understanding, characterization and mapping of the agricultural implications of climate variability and the development of climate risk management strategies specifically tailored to stakeholders needs. Application of these tools allows the development and dissemination of targeted investment innovations that have a high probability of biophysical and economic success in the context of climate variability. # 2008 Elsevier B.V.

climate change,"As water resources become further stressed due to increasing levels of societal demand, understanding the effect of climate change on various components of the water cycle is of strategic importance in management of this essential resource. In this study, we used a hydrologic model of Iran to study the impact of future climate on the country's water resources. The hydrologic model was created using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and calibrated for the period from 1980 to 2002 using daily river discharges and annual wheat yield data at a subbasin level. Future climate scenarios for periods of 2010–2040 and 2070–2100 were generated from the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CGCM 3.1) for scenarios A1B, B1, and A2, which were downscaled for 37 climate stations across the country. The hydrologic model was then applied to these periods to analyze the effect of future climate on precipitation, blue water, green water, and yield of wheat across the country. For future scenarios we found that in general, wet regions of the country will receive more rainfall while dry regions will receive less. Analysis of daily rainfall intensities indicated more frequent and larger‐intensity floods in the wet regions and more prolonged droughts in the dry regions. When aggregated to provincial levels, the differences in the predictions due to the three future scenarios were smaller than the uncertainty in the hydrologic model. However, at the subbasin level the three climate scenarios produced quite different results in the dry regions of the country, although the results in the wet regions were more or less similar."
climate change,"Although long considered to be of marginal importance to global climate change, tropospheric aerosol contributes substantially to radiative forcing, and anthropogenic sulfate aerosol in particular has imposed a major perturbation to this forcing. Both the direct scattering of shortwavelength solar radiation and the modification of the shortwave reflective properties of clouds by sulfate aerosol particles increase planetary albedo, thereby exerting a cooling influence on the planet. Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be –1 to –2 watts per square meter, globally averaged. This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign. Thus, the aerosol forcing has likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree. However, differences in geographical and seasonal distributions of these forcings preclude any simple compensation. Aerosol effects must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influences on past, current, and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding controls on emission of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide. Resolution of such policy issues requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical processes."

climate change,"Abstract It is well-known that the discount rate is crucially important for estimating the social cost of carbon, a standard indicator for the seriousness of climate change and desirable level of climate policy. The Ramsey equation for the discount rate has three components: the pure rate of time preference, a measure of relative risk aversion, and the rate of growth of per capita consumption. Much of the attention on the appropriate discount rate for long-term environmental problems has focussed on the role played by the pure rate of time preference in this formulation. We show that the other two elements are numerically just as important in considerations of anthropogenic climate change. The elasticity of the marginal utility with respect to consumption is particularly important because it assumes three roles: consumption smoothing over time, risk aversion, and inequity aversion. Given the large uncertainties about climate change and widely asymmetric impacts, the assumed rates of risk and inequity aversion can be expected to play significant roles. The consumption growth rate plays multiple roles, as well. It is one of the determinants of the discount rate, and one of the drivers of emissions and hence climate change. We also find that the impacts of climate change grow slower than income, so the effective discount rate is higher than the real discount rate. Moreover, the differential growth rate between rich and poor countries determines the time evolution of the size of the equity weights. As there are a number of crucial but uncertain parameters, it is no surprise that one can obtain almost any estimate of the social cost of carbon. We even show that, for a low pure rate of time preference, the estimate of the social cost of carbon is indeed arbitrary—as one can exclude neither large positive nor large negative impacts in the very long run. However, if we probabilistically constrain the parameters to values that are implied by observed behaviour, we find that the expected social cost of carbon, corrected for uncertainty and inequity, is approximate 60 US dollar per metric tonne of carbon (or roughly $17 per tonne of CO2) under the assumption that catastrophic risk is zero.

climate change,"Fifty-two percent of Americans think most climate scientists agree that the Earth has been warming in recent years, and 47% think climate scientists agree (i.e., that there is a scientific consensus) that human activities are a major cause of that warming, according to recent polling (see http://www.pollingreport.com/enviro.htm). However, attempts to quantify the scientific consensus on anthropogenic warming have met with criticism. For instance, Oreskes [2004] reviewed 928 abstracts from peer-reviewed research papers and found that more than 75% either explicitly or implicitly accepted the consensus view that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities. Yet Oreskes's approach has been criticized for overstating the level of consensus acceptance within the examined abstracts [Peiser, 2005] and for not capturing the full diversity of scientific opinion [Pielke, 2005]. A review of previous attempts at quantifying the consensus and criticisms is provided by Kendall Zimmerman [2008]. The objective of our study presented here is to assess the scientific consensus on climate change through an unbiased survey of a large and broad group of Earth scientists."
climate change,"The largest uncertainty in forecasting the effects of climate change on eco- systems is in understanding how it will affect the nature of interactions among species. Climate change may have unexpected consequences because different species show unique responses to changes in environmental temperatures. Here we show that increasingly warmer springs since 1962 have disrupted the trophic linkages between phytoplankton and zoo- plankton in a large temperate lake because of differing sensitivity to vernal warming. The timing of thermal stratification and the spring diatom bloom have advanced by more than 20 days during this time period. A long-term decline in Daphnia populations, the keystone herbivore, is associated with an expanding temporal mismatch with the spring diatom bloom and may have severe consequences for resource flow to upper trophic levels."
climate change,"Professor Ross Garnaut was commissioned by all of the Governments of Australia's Federation to examine the impacts of climate change on Australia and to recommend policy frameworks to improve the prospects of sustainable prosperity. The Garnaut Climate Change Review is one of the most important reports to be published in Australia for many years. It examines the impacts of climate change on the Australian economy, the costs of adaptation and mitigation, and the international context in which climate change is experienced and negotiated. It analyses the elements of an appropriate international policy response, and the challenges that face Australia in playing its proportionate part in that response. The Garnaut Climate Change Review is highly relevant to the global problem that is climate change. It considers what policies the international community should adopt in responding to climate change, and urges humanity to act now, and in concert, to develop the required policy response in time."
climate change,"Climate change is a threat to human health and life, both now and in the future. Despite this, studies show that the public typically do not consider the issue a priority concern or a direct, personal threat. Furthermore, few are taking any preventive or protective action. Previous studies identify direct experience as a major influence on risk perception, learning and action. Drawing on such evidence, this paper focuses on the intangibility of climate change as a key impediment to personal engagement and explores whether relevant experiences of flooding and air pollution influence individuals' knowledge, attitudes, risk perception and behavioural responses to climate change. Perhaps surprisingly, interviews and a survey conducted in the south of England indicate flood victims differ very little from other participants in their understanding of and responses to climate change, but that experience of air pollution does significantly affect perceptions of and behavioural responses to climate change. Air pollution victims are no more likely to cite pollution as a cause of climate change than non‐victims; but they do have higher pro‐environmental values. Respondents with these values are significantly more likely to consider climate change a salient risk and to take action in response to it. Therefore the relationship between air pollution experience and responses to climate change may be indirect and mediated by environmental values. The paper concludes by highlighting implications of this research for developing climate change policies and strategies for public engagement."
climate change,"Over the past few decades, land-use and climate change have led to substantial range contractions and species extinctions. Even more dramatic changes to global land cover are projected for this century. We used the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios to evaluate the exposure of all 8,750 land bird species to projected land-cover changes due to climate and land-use change. For this first baseline assessment, we assumed stationary geographic ranges that may overestimate actual losses in geographic range. Even under environmentally benign scenarios, at least 400 species are projected to suffer >50% range reductions by the year 2050 (over 900 by the year 2100). Although expected climate change effects at high latitudes are significant, species most at risk are predominantly narrow-ranged and endemic to the tropics, where projected range contractions are driven by anthropogenic land conversions. Most of these species are currently not recognized as imperiled. The causes, magnitude and geographic patterns of potential range loss vary across socioeconomic scenarios, but all scenarios (even the most environmentally benign ones) result in large declines of many species. Whereas climate change will severely affect biodiversity, in the near future, land-use change in tropical countries may lead to yet greater species loss. A vastly expanded reserve network in the tropics, coupled with more ambitious goals to reduce climate change, will be needed to minimize global extinctions."

climate change,"Marine turtles occupy a wide range of terrestrial and marine habitats, and many aspects of their life history have been demonstrated to be closely tied to climatic variables such as ambient temperature and storminess. As a group, therefore, marine turtles may be good indicators of climate change effects on coastal and marine habitats. Despite the small number of species in the taxon and a growing body of research in the field, the evidence base to predict resultant impacts of climate change remains relatively poor. We review the data from peer-reviewed publications to assess the likely impacts of climate change on marine turtles and highlight the types of data that would be most useful for an accurate assessment of future effects. The cumulative indications from these previous studies indicate that future research should focus on: (1) climate change effects on key habitats upon which turtles depend; (2) factors that influence nest site selection; (3) the consequences of skewed primary sex ratios; and (4) the effect of climate change on turtles at sea, for example range shifts and dietary breadth. Although it is too early to give detailed management recommendations, careful protection of coastlines along which turtles nest should be considered, as should the protection of beaches that produce male hatchlings, which may be of increased importance in the future. More active management approaches, for example translocation of eggs to suitable yet vacant nesting beaches, may be necessary to consider under worst-case scenarios."
climate change,"Southeastern Australia (SEA) has suffered from 10 years of low rainfall from 1997 to 2006. A protracted dry spell of this severity has been recorded once before during the 20th century, but current drought conditions are exacerbated by increasing temperatures. Impacts of this dry decade are wide‐ranging, so a major research effort is being directed to better understand the region's recent climate, its variability and climate change. This review summarizes the conditions of these 10 years and the main mechanisms that affect the climate."
climate change,"Abstract Extratropical and tropical transient storm tracks are investigated from the perspective of feature tracking in the ECHAM5 coupled climate model for the current and a future climate scenario. The atmosphere-only part of the model, forced by observed boundary conditions, produces results that agree well with analyses from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), including the distribution of storms as a function of maximum intensity. This provides the authors with confidence in the use of the model for the climate change experiments. The statistical distribution of storm intensities is virtually preserved under climate change using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario until the end of this century. There are no indications in this study of more intense storms in the future climate, either in the Tropics or extratropics, but rather a minor reduction in the number of weaker storms. However, significant changes occur on a regional ..."
climate change,"ABSTRACT Global climate change will increase outdoor and indoor heat loads, and may impair health and productivity for millions of working people. This study applies physiological evidence about effects of heat, climate guidelines for safe work environments, climate modeling, and global distributions of working populations to estimate the impact of 2 climate scenarios on future labor productivity. In most regions, climate change will decrease labor productivity, under the simple assumption of no specific adaptation. By the 2080s, the greatest absolute losses of population-based labor work capacity (in the range 11% to 27%) are seen under the A2 scenario in Southeast Asia, Andean and Central America, and the Caribbean. Increased occupational heat exposure due to climate change may significantly impact on labor productivity and costs unless preventive measures are implemented. Workers may need to work longer hours, or more workers may be required, to achieve the same output and there will be economic costs of lost production and/or occupational health interventions against heat exposures."
climate change,"Climate models have continued to be developed and improved since the AR4, and many models have been extended into Earth System models by including the representation of biogeochemical cycles important to climate change. These models allow for policy-relevant calculations such as the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions compatible with a specified climate stabilization target. In addition, the range of climate variables and processes that have been evaluated has greatly expanded, and differences between models and observations are increasingly quantified using ‘performance metrics’. In this chapter, model evaluation covers simulation of the mean climate, of historical climate change, of variability on multiple time scales and of regional modes of variability. This evaluation is based on recent internationally coordinated model experiments, including simulations of historic and paleo climate, specialized experiments designed to provide insight into key climate processes and feedbacks and regional climate downscaling. Figure 9.44 provides an overview of model capabilities as assessed in this chapter, including improvements, or lack thereof, relative to models assessed in the AR4. The chapter concludes with an assessment of recent work connecting model performance to the detection and attribution of climate change as well as to future projections. {9.1.2, 9.8.1, Table 9.1, Figure 9.44} 
 
The ability of climate models to simulate surface temperature has improved in many, though not all, important aspects relative to the generation of models assessed in the AR4."
climate change,"This paper examines the relationships between climate-related vulnerabilities, adaptation practices, institutions, and external interventions to show the role and importance of local institutions in climate change. The increasing attention to adaptation to climate change has not come with sufficient emphasis on the local nature of climate adaptation and on the role of local institutions and local governance in shaping adaptation practices. This paper presents two research projects on adaptation and institutions at the World Bank which aim to illuminate precisely these existing lacunae in theoretical and practical knowledge about adaptation. Focusing on the linkages between adaptation strategies and institutions, the first study shows the critical role institutions play in determining the nature and outcomes of adaptation strategies in a territorial development context and will try to demonstrate how past decentralized and area-based approaches on local development could be used to strengthen local adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change related risks. The second study focuses on an assessment of the relative costs and benefits of different adaptation responses related to a subset of climate hazards (particularly droughts and erratic rainfall), and the role of institutions in reducing the costs of adaptation."

CCSM3 is a coupled climate model with components representing the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface connected by a flux coupler. CCSM3 is designed to produce realistic simulations over a wide range of spatial resolutions, enabling inexpensive simulations lasting several millennia or detailed studies of continental-scale dynamics, variability, and climate change. This paper will show results from the configuration used for climate-change simulations with a T85 grid for the atmosphere and land and a grid with approximately 1° resolution for the ocean and sea ice. The new system incorporates several significant improvements in the physical parameterizations.

climate change,"Urban areas are hot spots that drive environmental change at multiple scales. Material demands of production and human consumption alter land use and cover, biodiversity, and hydrosystems locally to regionally, and urban waste discharge affects local to global biogeochemical cycles and climate. For urbanites, however, global environmental changes are swamped by dramatic changes in the local environment. Urban ecology integrates natural and social sciences to study these radically altered local environments and their regional and global effects. Cities themselves present both the problems and solutions to sustainability challenges of an increasingly urbanized world."
climate change,"The impact of climate change on Africa is likely to be severe because of adverse direct effects, high agricultural dependence, and limited capacity to adapt. Direct effects vary widely across the continent, with some areas (e.g. eastern Africa) predicted to get wetter, but much of southern Africa getting drier and hotter. Crop yields will be adversely affected and the frequency of extreme weather events will increase. Adaptation to climate change is primarily a private-sector response and should involve relocation of people, changes in the sectoral structure of production, and changes in crop patterns. The role of government is primarily to provide the information, incentives, and economic environment to facilitate such changes. Adaptation will be impeded by Africa's fragmentation into small countries and ethnic groups, and by poor business environments. On the mitigation side, there is a need to design emissions-trading frameworks that support greater African participation than at present, and that include land-use change. Mitigation undertaken elsewhere will have a major impact on Africa, both positive (e.g. new technologies) and negative (e.g. commodity price changes arising from biofuel policies)."
climate change,"There is a growing consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activity will alter the earth’s climate, most notably by causing temperatures, precipitation levels, and weather variability to increase. The design of optimal climate change mitigation policies requires estimates of the health and other benefits of reductions in greenhouse gases; current evidence on the magnitude of the direct and indirect impacts, however, is considered insufficient for reliable conclusions (A. J. McMichael et al. 2003).1 In addition to the overall predicted warming trend, one important feature of many global climate change forecasts is an increased incidence of very high and low temperatures. To provide evidence of the potential benefits of greenhouse gas reductions, this paper documents whether the temperature variation predicted to be part of climate change, including extreme high and low temperatures, historically has had negative health consequences through its effect on babies while in utero. Using individual-level data on more than 37.1 million births, we find that exposure to extreme hot temperatures during pregnancy leads to lower birth weight. We combine this"
climate change,"It may be too late to achieve environmental justice for some indigenous peoples, and other groups, in terms of avoiding dangerous climate change. People in the indigenous climate justice movement agree resolutely on the urgency of action to stop dangerous climate change. However, the qualities of relationships connecting indigenous peoples with other societies' governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations are not conducive to coordinated action that would avoid further injustice against indigenous peoples in the process of responding to climate change. The required qualities include, among others, consent, trust, accountability, and reciprocity. Indigenous traditions of climate change view the very topic of climate change as connected to these qualities, which are sometimes referred to as kin relationships. The entwinement of colonialism, capitalism, and industrialization failed to affirm or establish these qualities or kinship relationships across societies. While qualities like consent or reciprocity may be critical for taking coordinated action urgently and justly, they require a long time to establish or repair. A relational tipping point, in a certain respect, has already been crossed, before the ecological tipping point. The time it takes to address the passage of this relational tipping point may be too slow to generate the coordinated action to halt certain dangers related to climate change. While no possibilities for better futures should be left unconsidered, it's critical to center environmental justice in any analysis of whether it's too late to stop dangerous climate change."
climate change,"This paper presents and applies a conceptual framework to address human vulnerability to climate change. Drawing upon social risk management and asset-based approaches, the conceptual framework provides a unifying lens to examine links between risks, adaptation, and vulnerability. The result is an integrated approach to increase the capacity of society to manage climate risks with a view to reduce the vulnerability of households and maintain or increase the opportunities for sustainable development. We identify 'no-regrets' adaptation interventions, meaning actions that generate net social benefits under all future scenarios of climate change and impacts. We also make the case for greater external support for community-based adaptation, discuss the role of social protection, and propose a research agenda."
climate change,"Introduction Projections of future climate and its impacts on society and the environment have been crucial for the emergence of climate change as a global problem for public policy and decision-making. Climate projections are based on a variety of scenarios, models and simulations which contain a number of embedded assumptions. Central to much of the discussion surrounding adaptation to climate change is the claim – explicit or implicit – that decision-makers need accurate, and increasingly precise, assessments of the future impacts of climate change in order to adapt successfully. According to Fussel (2007), ‘the effectiveness of pro-active adaptation to climate change often depends on the accuracy of regional climate and impact projections, which are subject to substantial uncertainty’. Similarly, Gagnon-Lebrun and Agrawala (2006) note that the level of certainty associated with climate change and impact projections is often key to determining the extent to which such information can be used to formulate appropriate adaptation responses. If true, these claims place a high premium on accurate and precise climate predictions at a range of geographical and temporal scales. But is effective adaptation tied to the ability of the scientific enterprise to predict future climate with accuracy and precision? This chapter addresses this important question by investigating whether or not the lack of accurate climate predictions represents a limit – or perceived limit – to adaptation."
climate change,"Efforts to elucidate the effect of climate change on biodiversity with detailed data sets and refined models reach novel conclusions. Over the past decade, several models have been developed to predict the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Results from these models have suggested some alarming consequences of climate change for biodiversity, predicting, for example, that in the next century many plants and animals will go extinct (1) and there could be a large-scale dieback of tropical rainforests (2). However, caution may be required in interpreting results from these models, not least because their coarse spatial scales fail to capture topography or “microclimatic buffering” and they often do not consider the full acclimation capacity of plants and animals (3). Several recent studies indicate that taking these factors into consideration can seriously alter the model predictions (4–7)."
climate change,"Recent, rapid climate change is driving evolution, as organisms adapt to altered seasonal events rather than to the direct effects of increasing temperature."
climate change,"Global atmospheric temperatures are presently in a warming phase that began 250--300 years ago. Speculations on the potential impact of continued warming on human health often focus on mosquito-borne diseases. Elementary models suggest that higher global temperatures will enhance their transmission rates and extend their geographic ranges. However, the histories of three such diseases--malaria, yellow fever, and dengue--reveal that climate has rarely been the principal determinant of their prevalence or range; human activities and their impact on local ecology have generally been much more significant. It is therefore inappropriate to use climate-based models to predict future prevalence."
climate change,"There is already widespread change in the natural calendars (phenology) of plants and animals, as well as change in some species distributions. Now threshold change (sudden, fundamental change) in ecosystems is beginning to be observed in nature. At minimum, the natural world will experience an equal amount of warming to that which has already taken place. This all suggests a future with nature and ecosystems very much in flux with profound implications for epidemiology."
climate change,"Food insecurity is likely to increase under climate change, unless early warning systems and development programs are used more effectively."
climate change,"There is scientific consensus that the global climate is changing, with rising surface temperatures, melting ice and snow, rising sea levels, and increasing climate variability. These changes are expected to have substantial impacts on human health. There are known, effective public health responses for many of these impacts, but the scope, timeline, and complexity of climate change are unprecedented. We propose a public health approach to climate change, based on the essential public health services, that extends to both clinical and population health services and emphasizes the coordination of government agencies (federal, state, and local), academia, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations."
climate change,"The area burned by forest fires in Canada has increased over the past four decades, at the same time as summer season temperatures have warmed. Here we use output from a coupled climate model to demonstrate that human emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosol have made a detectable contribution to this warming. We further show that human‐induced climate change has had a detectable influence on the area burned by forest fire in Canada over recent decades. This increase in area burned is likely to have important implications for terrestrial emissions of carbon dioxide and for forest ecosystems."
climate change,"In this article, we argue that a major reason the United States failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to ameliorate global warming is the opposition of the American conservative movement, a key segment of the anti-environmental counter-movement. We examine how the conservative movement mobilized between 1990 and 1997 to construct the ""non-problematicity"" of global warming. After we describe how conservative think tanks mobilized to challenge the global warming claims of mainstream climate science, we examine how these countermovement organizations aligned themselves with prominent American climate change skeptics known for their staunch criticism of mainstream climate research and their affiliations with the fossil fuels industry. We then examine how the efforts of these conservative think tanks were enhanced by the shift in the political opportunity structure created by the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress. This study demonstrates how a powerful countermovement effectively challenged the environmental community's definition of global warming as a social problem and blocked the passage of any significant climate change policy."
climate change,"Our paper documents that land-use change impacts regional and global climate through the surface-energy budget, as well as through the carbon cycle. The surface-energy budget effects may be more important than the carbon-cycle effects. However, land-use impacts on climate cannot be adequately quantified with the usual metric of ‘global warming potential’. A new metric is needed to quantify the human disturbance of the Earth's surface-energy budget. This ‘regional climate change potential’ could offer a new metric for developing a more inclusive climate protocol. This concept would also implicitly provide a mechanism to monitor potential local-scale environmental changes that could influence biodiversity."
climate change,"Abstract Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into pastures or annual crops could lead to changes in the climate. We have used a coupled numerical model of the global atmosphere and biosphere (Center for Ocean-Land- Atmosphere GCM) to assess the effects of Amazonian deforestation on the regional and global climate. We found that when the Amazonian tropical forests were replaced by degraded grass (pasture) in the model, there was a significant increase in the mean surface temperature (about 2.5°C) and a decrease in the annual evapo-transpiration (30% reduction), precipitation (25% reduction), and runoff (20% reduction) in the region. The differences between the two simulations were greatest during the dry season. The deforested case was associated with larger diurnal fluctuations of surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit; such effects have been observed in existing deforested arms in Amazonia. The calculated reduction in precipitation was larger than the calculated decrease in evapotranspirat..."
climate change,"No country is immune to climate change, but the developing world will bear the brunt of the effects, including some 75 to 80% of the costs of anticipated damages. Millions in densely populated coastal areas and in island nations will lose their homes as the sea level rises, while poor people will face crop failures, reduced agricultural productivity, and increased hunger, malnutrition, and disease. Extreme events such as droughts, floods, and forest fires will become more frequent, making it even harder for developing countries to attain the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals of 2015. A “climate-smart” world is possible in our time. But to ensure a safe and sustainable future, all nations must act now, act together, and act differently."
climate change,"Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species’ environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species’ physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study."
climate change,"The following text is taken from the publisher's website: 
""Climate change is one of the most challenging issues of our time. As key sites in the production and management of emissions of greenhouse gases, cities will be crucial for the implementation of international agreements and national policies on climate change. This book provides a critical analysis of the role of cities in addressing climate change and the prospects for urban sustainability. 
Cities and Climate Change is the first in-depth analysis of the role of cities in addressing climate change. The book argues that key challenges concerning the resources and powers of local government, as well as conflicts between local goals for economic development and climate change mitigation, have restricted the level of local action on climate change. These findings have significant implications for the prospects of mitigating climate change and achieving urban sustainability. This book provides a valuable interdisciplinary analysis of these issues, and will appeal to students and researchers interested in sustainability at local and global scales."""
climate change,"Abstract:  Limitations imposed on species ranges by the climatic, ecological, and physiological effects of elevation are important determinants of extinction risk. We modeled the effects of elevational limits on the extinction risk of landbirds, 87% of all bird species. Elevational limitation of range size explained 97% of the variation in the probability of being in a World Conservation Union category of extinction risk. Our model that combined elevational ranges, four Millennium Assessment habitat‐loss scenarios, and an intermediate estimate of surface warming of 2.8° C, projected a best guess of 400–550 landbird extinctions, and that approximately 2150 additional species would be at risk of extinction by 2100. For Western Hemisphere landbirds, intermediate extinction estimates based on climate‐induced changes in actual distributions ranged from 1.3% (1.1° C warming) to 30.0% (6.4° C warming) of these species. Worldwide, every degree of warming projected a nonlinear increase in bird extinctions of about 100–500 species. Only 21% of the species predicted to become extinct in our scenarios are currently considered threatened with extinction. Different habitat‐loss and surface‐warming scenarios predicted substantially different futures for landbird species. To improve the precision of climate‐induced extinction estimates, there is an urgent need for high‐resolution measurements of shifts in the elevational ranges of species. Given the accelerating influence of climate change on species distributions and conservation, using elevational limits in a tested, standardized, and robust manner can improve conservation assessments of terrestrial species and will help identify species that are most vulnerable to global climate change. Our climate‐induced extinction estimates are broadly similar to those of bird species at risk from other factors, but these estimates largely involve different sets of species."
climate change,"Climate change and habitat destruction are two of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. Lattice models have been used to investigate how hypothetical species with different characteristics respond to habitat loss. The main result shows that a sharp threshold in habitat availability exists below which a species rapidly becomes extinct. Here, a similar modelling approach is taken to establish what determines how species respond to climate change. A similar threshold exists for the rate of climate change as has been observed for habitat loss—patch occupancy remains high up to a critical rate of climate change, beyond which species extinction becomes likely. Habitat specialists, especially those of relatively poor colonizing ability are least able to keep pace with climate change. The interaction between climate change and habitat loss might be disastrous. During climate change, the habitat threshold occurs sooner. Similarly, species suffer more from climate change in a fragmented habitat."
climate change,"We quantify the risks of climate-induced changes in key ecosystem processes during the 21st century by forcing a dynamic global vegetation model with multiple scenarios from 16 climate models and mapping the proportions of model runs showing forest/nonforest shifts or exceedance of natural variability in wildfire frequency and freshwater supply. Our analysis does not assign probabilities to scenarios or weights to models. Instead, we consider distribution of outcomes within three sets of model runs grouped by the amount of global warming they simulate: <2°C (including simulations in which atmospheric composition is held constant, i.e., in which the only climate change is due to greenhouse gases already emitted), 2–3°C, and >3°C. High risk of forest loss is shown for Eurasia, eastern China, Canada, Central America, and Amazonia, with forest extensions into the Arctic and semiarid savannas; more frequent wildfire in Amazonia, the far north, and many semiarid regions; more runoff north of 50°N and in tropical Africa and northwestern South America; and less runoff in West Africa, Central America, southern Europe, and the eastern U.S. Substantially larger areas are affected for global warming >3°C than for <2°C; some features appear only at higher warming levels. A land carbon sink of ≈1 Pg of C per yr is simulated for the late 20th century, but for >3°C this sink converts to a carbon source during the 21st century (implying a positive climate feedback) in 44% of cases. The risks continue increasing over the following 200 years, even with atmospheric composition held constant."

We suggest that traditional approaches to international relations— regime theory and transnational networks—offer limited conceptual space for analyzing such networks. These approaches obscure how the governance of global climate change takes place through processes and institutions operating at and between a variety of scales and involving a range of actors with different levels and forms of authority. We contend that it is only by taking a multilevel perspective that we can fully capture the social, political, and economic processes that shape global environmental governance.

climate change,"It is widely recognized that anthropogenic climate change will have harmful effects on many human beings and, in particular, on the most disadvantaged. Specifically, it is projected to result in flooding, heat stress, food insecurity, drought and increased exposure to water-borne and vector-borne diseases. Various different normative frameworks have been employed to think about climate change. Some, for example, apply cost–benefit analysis to climate change. The Stern Review provides a good example of this approach. It proceeds by comparing the costs (and any benefits) associated with anthropogenic climate change with the costs and any benefits of a programme for combating climate change. On this basis it argues that an aggressive policy of mitigation and adaptation is justified. Whereas the costs of combating climate change, according to Stern, are quite low, the costs of ‘business of usual’ would be considerable. Other analysts adopt a second perspective and conceive of climate change in terms of its impact on security. For example, the High Representative and the European Commission to the European Council issued a statement on Climate Change and International Security which argues that climate change is ‘a threat multiplier which exacerbates existing trends, tensions and instability’. It argues that climate change will contribute to insecurities, such as tensions over scarce resources, land loss and border disputes, conflicts over energy sources, conflict prompted by migration and tensions between those whose emissions caused climate change and those who will suffer the consequences."
climate change,"The first expected symptoms of a climate change-generated biodiversity crisis are range contractions and extinctions at lower elevational and latitudinal limits to species distributions. However, whilst range expansions at high elevations and latitudes have been widely documented, there has been surprisingly little evidence for contractions at warm margins. We show that lower elevational limits for 16 butterfly species in central Spain have risen on average by 212 m (± SE 60) in 30 years, accompanying a 1.3 °C rise (equivalent to c. 225 m) in mean annual temperature. These elevational shifts signify an average reduction in habitable area by one-third, with losses of 50-80% projected for the coming century, given maintenance of the species thermal associations. The results suggest that many species have already suffered climate-mediated habitat losses that may threaten their long-term chances of survival."
climate change,"This paper analyses the global consequences to crop yields, production, and risk of hunger of linked socio-economic and climate scenarios. Potential impacts of climate change are estimated for climate change scenarios developed from the HadCM3 global climate model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1FI, A2, B1, and B2. Projected changes in yield are calculated using transfer functions derived from crop model simulations with observed climate data and projected climate change scenarios. The basic linked system (BLS) is used to evaluate consequent changes in global cereal production, cereal prices and the number of people at risk from hunger. The crop yield results elucidate the complex regional patterns of projected climate variables, CO2 effects, and agricultural systems that contribute to aggregations of global crop production. The A1FI scenario, as expected with its large increase in global temperatures, exhibits the greatest decreases both regionally and globally in yields, especially by the 2080s. The contrast between the yield change in developed and developing countries is largest under the A2a–c scenarios. Under the B1 and B2 scenarios, developed and developing countries exhibit less contrast in crop yield changes, with the B2 future crop yield changes being slightly more favourable than those of the B1 scenario. When crop yield results are introduced to the BLS world food trade system model, the combined model and scenario experiments demonstrate that the world, for the most part, appears to be able to continue to feed itself under the SRES scenarios during the rest of this century. However, this outcome is achieved through production in the developed countries (which mostly benefit from climate change) compensating for declines projected, for the most part, for developing nations. While global production appears stable, regional differences in crop production are likely to grow stronger through time, leading to a significant polarisation of effects, with substantial increases in prices and risk of hunger amongst the poorer nations, especially under scenarios of greater inequality (A1FI and A2). The use of the SRES scenarios highlights several non-linearities in the world food supply system, both in the biophysical sense, where the levels of atmospheric CO2 tested reach new levels, and the socio-economic sense, where changes in population dynamics and economic and political structures complicate the translation of biophysical climate change impacts into social indices, such as the number of people at risk of hunger. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

climate change,"Elevated ocean temperatures can cause coral bleaching, the loss of colour from reef‐building corals because of a breakdown of the symbiosis with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Recent studies have warned that global climate change could increase the frequency of coral bleaching and threaten the long‐term viability of coral reefs. These assertions are based on projecting the coarse output from atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (GCMs) to the local conditions around representative coral reefs."
climate change,"This paper argues that, in order to address the challenges of climate change, attention needs to be focused not only at the international level but also on how climate protection policy is taking shape locally. It provides a comparative analysis of local climate change policy in Germany and the UK. By moving the focus from an analysis of the formal competencies of local government to the multiple modes of governing through which climate protection is taking place, the similarities between the two countries are brought into view. In both cases, actions are concentrated in the energy sphere and municipalities are increasingly deploying self-governing and enabling approaches to undertaken emissions reductions. The paper argues that the impacts of EU policies, financial crises and the political challenges of implementing climate change policies are changing the capacity for local intervention, with potentially significant consequences for medium- and long-term goals for climate protection."
climate change,"Increases in key measures of Atlantic hurricane activity over recent decades are believed to reflect, in large part, contemporaneous increases in tropical Atlantic warmth [e.g., Emanuel, 2005]. Some recent studies [e.g., Goldenberg et al., 2001] have attributed these increases to a natural climate cycle termed the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), while other studies suggest that climate change may instead be playing the dominant role [Emanuel, 2005; Webster et al., 2005]. 
 
Using a formal statistical analysis to separate the estimated influences of anthropogenic climate change from possible natural cyclical influences, this article presents results indicating that anthropogenic factors are likely responsible for long-term trends in tropical Atlantic warmth and tropical cyclone activity. In addition, this analysis indicates that late twentieth century tropospheric aerosol cooling has offset a substantial fraction of anthropogenic warming in the region and has thus likely suppressed even greater potential increases in tropical cyclone activity."
climate change,"Eleven coupled climate–carbon cycle models used a common protocol to study the coupling between climate change and the carbon cycle. The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850–2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5°C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models."
climate change,"There is now clear scientific evidence that emissions from economic activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels for energy, are causing changes to the Earth´s climate. A sound understanding of the economics of climate change is needed in order to underpin an effective global response to this challenge. The Stern Review is an independent, rigourous and comprehensive analysis of the economic aspects of this crucial issue. It has been conducted by Sir Nicholas Stern, Head of the UK Government Economic Service, and a former Chief Economist of the World Bank. The Economics of Climate Change will be invaluable for all students of the economics and policy implications of climate change, and economists, scientists and policy makers involved in all aspects of climate change."
climate change,"The increasing demand by the scientific community, policy makers, and the public for realistic projections of possible regional impacts of future climate changes has rendered the issue of regional climate simulation critically important. The problem of projecting regional climate changes can be identified as that of representing effects of atmospheric forcings on two different spatial scales: large-scale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the general circulation and determine the sequence of weather events which characterize the climate regime of a given region (for example, greenhouse gas abundance), and mesoscale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the local circulations, thereby regulating the regional distribution of climatic variables (for example, complex mountainous systems). General circulation models (GCMs) are the main tools available today for climate simulation. However, they are run and will likely be run for the next several years at resolutions which are too coarse to adequately describe mesoscale forcings and yield accurate regional climate detail. This paper presents a review of these approaches. They can be divided in three broad categories: (1) Purely empirical approaches, in which the forcings are not explicitly accounted for, but regional climate scenarios are constructed by using instrumental data records or paleoclimatic analogues; (2) semiempirical approaches, in which GCMs are used to describe the atmospheric response to large-scale forcings of relevance to climate changes, and empirical techniques account for the effect of mesoscale forcings; and (3) modeling approaches, in which mesoscale forcings are described by increasing the model resolution only over areas of interest. Since they are computationally inexpensive, empirical and semiempirical techniques have been so far more widely used. Their application to regional climate change projection is, however, limited by their own empiricism and by the availability of data sets of adequate quality. More recently, a nested GCM-limited area model methodology for regional climate simulation has been developed, with encouraging preliminary results. As it is physically, rather than empirically, based, the nested modeling framework has a wide range of applications."

climate change,"Problem: Global warming has emerged as one of the new century's top planning challenges. But it is far from clear how state and local governments in the United States can best address climate change through planning. Purpose: As of 2008, 29 states had prepared some sort of climate change plan, and more than 170 local governments had joined the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) campaign that requires that a plan be developed. This article analyzes this first generation of climate change plans and seeks to assess the goals being set, the measures included or left out, issues surrounding implementation, and the basic strengths and weaknesses of state and local climate change planning to date. Methods: I conducted this research by analyzing planning documents as well as interviewing state and local officials by telephone. I analyzed the plans of three types of governments: all states with planning documents on climate change; cities with populations of over 500,000 that are members of the CCP campaign; and selected smaller cities that are CCP members. Results and conclusions: Most plans set emissions-reduction goals, establish emission inventories, green public sector operations, and recommend a range of other measures. Many recent plans have been developed through extensive stakeholder processes and present very detailed lists of recommendations with quantified emissions benefits. But emissions-reduction goals vary widely, many proposed actions are voluntary, few resources have been allocated, and implementation of most measures has not yet taken place. Most plans do not address adaptation to a changing climate. Officials see rapidly growing public awareness of the issue and general support for climate change planning, but reluctance to change personal behavior. Takeaway for practice: Future climate change planning should (a) set goals that can adequately address the problem; (b) establish long-term planning frameworks in which progress toward these goals can be monitored on a regular basis and actions revised as needed; (c) include the full range of measures needed to reduce and adapt to climate change; (d) ensure implementation of recommended actions through commitment of resources, revised regulation, incentives for reducing emissions, and other means; and (e) develop strategies to deepen public awareness of the need for fundamental changes in behavior, for example regarding motor vehicle use.

climate change,"This paper examines the impact of climate change on rich and poor countries across the world. We measure two indices of the relative impact of climate across countries, impact per capita, and impact per GDP. These measures sum market impacts across the climate-sensitive economic sectors of each country. Both indices reveal that climate change will have serious distributional impact across countries, grouped by income per capita. We predict that poor countries will suffer the bulk of the damages from climate change. Although adaptation, wealth, and technology may influence distributional consequences across countries, we argue that the primary reason that poor countries are so vulnerable is their location. Countries in the low latitudes start with very high temperatures. Further warming pushes these countries ever further away from optimal temperatures for climate-sensitive economic sectors."
climate change,"Tourism is a climate-dependent industry, and many destinations owe their popularity to their pleasant climates during traditional holiday seasons. This article explores the potential implications of climate change for global tourism, with special emphasis on seasonality. Combination of two climate change scenarios with the Tourism Climatic Index reveals that the locations of climatically ideal tourism conditions are likely to shift poleward under projected climate change. Whereas destinations such as the Mediterranean may see shifts in their peak seasons from summer months to current shoulder periods, regions in higher latitudes are likely to experience a lengthening of their summer seasons. The effects of these changes will depend greatly on the flexibility demonstrated by institutions and tourists as they react to climate change, with substantial implications for both spatial and temporal redistribution of tourism activities.

climate change,"A new data set enhances the abilities of researchers and decision-makers to assess possible future climates, explore societal impacts, and approach policy responses from a risk-based perspective. The data set, which consists of a library of 112 fine-resolution climate projections, based on 16 climate models and three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, is now publicly available. Monthly climate projections from 1950 to 2099 were downscaled to a spatial resolution of ⅛° (about 140 square kilometers per grid cell) covering the conterminous United States and portions of Canada and Mexico. 
 
For the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate modeling groups produced hundreds of simulations of past and future climates. The colocation of these simulations in a single archive (at the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), established to facilitate assessment of general circulation models, or GCMs) and the conversion of all results to a common data format have made probabilistic, multi-model projections and impact assessments practical. A remaining issue is that the spatial scale of climate model output is typically too coarse for regional impact studies. Multiple downscaling approaches exist for deriving regional climate from coarse-resolution model output; these approaches are typically applied on an ad hoc basis to a particular region."
climate change,"Palaeoclimate data show that the Earth's climate is remarkably sensitive to global forcings. Positive feedbacks predominate. This allows the entire planet to be whipsawed between climate states. One feedback, the ‘albedo flip’ property of ice/water, provides a powerful trigger mechanism. A climate forcing that ‘flips’ the albedo of a sufficient portion of an ice sheet can spark a cataclysm. Inertia of ice sheet and ocean provides only moderate delay to ice sheet disintegration and a burst of added global warming. Recent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate change that could run out of our control, with great dangers for humans and other creatures. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the largest human-made climate forcing, but other trace constituents are also important. Only intense simultaneous efforts to slow CO2 emissions and reduce non-CO2 forcings can keep climate within or near the range of the past million years. The most important of the non-CO2 forcings is methane (CH4), as it causes the second largest human-made GHG climate forcing and is the principal cause of increased tropospheric ozone (O3), which is the third largest GHG forcing. Nitrous oxide (N2O) should also be a focus of climate mitigation efforts. Black carbon (‘black soot’) has a high global warming potential (approx. 2000, 500 and 200 for 20, 100 and 500 years, respectively) and deserves greater attention. Some forcings are especially effective at high latitudes, so concerted efforts to reduce their emissions could preserve Arctic ice, while also having major benefits for human health, agricultural productivity and the global environment."
climate change,"This study examines the impact of climate change on cropland in Africa. It is based on a survey of more than 9,000 farmers in 11 countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Senegal, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The study uses a Ricardian cross-sectional approach in which net revenue is regressed on climate, water flow, soil, and economic variables. The results show that net revenues fall as precipitation falls or as temperatures warm across all the surveyed farms. In addition to examining all farms together, the study examined dryland and irrigated farms separately. Dryland farms are especially climate sensitive. Irrigated farms have a positive immediate response to warming because they are located in relatively cool parts of Africa. The study also examined some simple climate scenarios to see how Africa would respond to climate change. These uniform scenarios assume that only one aspect of climate changes and the change is uniform across all of Africa. In addition, the study examined three climate change scenarios from Atmospheric Oceanic General Circulation Models. These scenarios predicted changes in climate in each country over time. Not all countries are equally vulnerable to climate change. First, the climate scenarios predict different temperature and precipitation changes in each country. Second, it is also important whether a country is already hot and dry. Third, the extent to which farms are irrigated is also important."
climate change,"This study is experimental and innovative in nature. The CGE modeling has made use of many assumptions to estimate the economics of adaptation to climate change in Ghana in a long time horizon. The numbers and results in the report should be used with caution, and considered indicative. While the report suggests short and long-term policy and investment options, the authors believe that further review of the cost-benefit of adaptation options should be undertaken."
climate change,"Throughout the world, efforts are under way to restore watersheds, but restoration planning rarely accounts for future climate change. Using a series of linked models of climate, land cover, hydrology, and salmon population dynamics, we investigated the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of proposed habitat restoration efforts designed to recover depleted Chinook salmon populations in a Pacific Northwest river basin. Model results indicate a large negative impact of climate change on freshwater salmon habitat. Habitat restoration and protection can help to mitigate these effects and may allow populations to increase in the face of climate change. The habitat deterioration associated with climate change will, however, make salmon recovery targets much more difficult to attain. Because the negative impacts of climate change in this basin are projected to be most pronounced in relatively pristine, high-elevation streams where little restoration is possible, climate change and habitat restoration together are likely to cause a spatial shift in salmon abundance. River basins that span the current snow line appear especially vulnerable to climate change, and salmon recovery plans that enhance lower-elevation habitats are likely to be more successful over the next 50 years than those that target the higher-elevation basins likely to experience the greatest snow–rain transition."
climate change,"Carbon Cycle and Climate Change As climate change accelerates, it is important to know the likely impact of climate change on the carbon cycle (see the Perspective by Reich). Gross primary production (GPP) is a measure of the amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere every year to fuel photosynthesis. Beer et al. (p. 834, published online 5 July) used a combination of observation and calculation to estimate that the total GPP by terrestrial plants is around 122 billion tons per year; in comparison, burning fossil fuels emits about 7 billion tons annually. Thirty-two percent of this uptake occurs in tropical forests, and precipitation controls carbon uptake in more than 40% of vegetated land. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of ecosystem respiratory processes is a key determinant of the interaction between climate and the carbon cycle. Mahecha et al. (p. 838, published online 5 July) now show that the Q10 of ecosystem respiration is invariant with respect to mean annual temperature, independent of the analyzed ecosystem type, with a global mean value for Q10 of 1.6. This level of temperature sensitivity suggests a less-pronounced climate sensitivity of the carbon cycle than assumed by recent climate models. A combination of data and models provides an estimate of how much photosynthesis by all the world’s plants occurs each year. Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is the largest global CO2 flux driving several ecosystem functions. We provide an observation-based estimate of this flux at 123 ± 8 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year−1) using eddy covariance flux data and various diagnostic models. Tropical forests and savannahs account for 60%. GPP over 40% of the vegetated land is associated with precipitation. State-of-the-art process-oriented biosphere models used for climate predictions exhibit a large between-model variation of GPP’s latitudinal patterns and show higher spatial correlations between GPP and precipitation, suggesting the existence of missing processes or feedback mechanisms which attenuate the vegetation response to climate. Our estimates of spatially distributed GPP and its covariation with climate can help improve coupled climate–carbon cycle process models."
climate change,"Changing temperature and precipitation pattern and increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are likely to drive significant modifications in natural and modified forests. Our review is focused on recent publications that discuss the changes in commercial forestry, excluding the ecosystem functions of forests and nontimber forest products. We concentrate on potential direct and indirect impacts of climate change on forest industry, the projections of future trends in commercial forestry, the possible role of biofuels, and changes in supply and demand."
climate change,"Although scientists have warned of possible social perils resulting from climate change, the impacts of long-term climate change on social unrest and population collapse have not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, high-resolution paleo-climatic data have been used to explore at a macroscale the effects of climate change on the outbreak of war and population decline in the preindustrial era. We show that long-term fluctuations of war frequency and population changes followed the cycles of temperature change. Further analyses show that cooling impeded agricultural production, which brought about a series of serious social problems, including price inflation, then successively war outbreak, famine, and population decline successively. The findings suggest that worldwide and synchronistic war–peace, population, and price cycles in recent centuries have been driven mainly by long-term climate change. The findings also imply that social mechanisms that might mitigate the impact of climate change were not significantly effective during the study period. Climate change may thus have played a more important role and imposed a wider ranging effect on human civilization than has so far been suggested. Findings of this research may lend an additional dimension to the classic concepts of Malthusianism and Darwinism."
climate change,"Global warming and related climate changes arelikely to significantly increase the weather-related risks facing human settlements, including floods, water and power supply failures and associated economic collapse into “failed cities”. Action to help poor urban communities adapt to become more resilient to possible change must therefore be initiated, although to date attention has focused on mitigation rather than adaptation. This paper considers the physical and financial implications for urban areas of the potential impacts of climate variability and change on water resources, illustrated by examples from sub-Saharan Africa, which is likely to be one of the most vulnerable and most affected regions. Water management, which will be particularly affected by climate change, could provide an opportunity to initiate structured adaptation responses. Adaptation costs in the sub-Saharan urban water sector are estimated at between 10 and 20 per cent of current overseas development assistance to the region. This paper suggests that additional funding should be made available in terms of the “polluter pays” principle, and should be channelled through government budgets rather than ring-fenced climate funds. This would help ensure that “climate proofing” is mainstreamed and would be in keeping with current trends in overseas development assistance reflected in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness."
climate change,"Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species' environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study."

climate change,"We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments."
climate change,"A new ecosystem-based climate envelope modeling approach was applied to assess potential climate change impacts on forest communities and tree species. Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to describe the realized climate space for British Columbia's ecosystems and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing. Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated as a basis for systematic surveys of biological response to climate change."
climate change,"This article argues for a cultural perspective to be brought to bear on studies of climate change risk perception. Developing the “circuit of culture” model, the article maintains that the producers and consumers of media texts are jointly engaged in dynamic, meaning‐making activities that are context‐specific and that change over time. A critical discourse analysis of climate change based on a database of newspaper reports from three U.K. broadsheet papers over the period 1985–2003 is presented. This empirical study identifies three distinct circuits of climate change—1985–1990, 1991–1996, 1997–2003—which are characterized by different framings of risks associated with climate change. The article concludes that there is evidence of social learning as actors build on their experiences in relation to climate change science and policy making. Two important factors in shaping the U.K.'s broadsheet newspapers' discourse on “dangerous” climate change emerge as the agency of top political figures and the dominant ideological standpoints in different newspapers."

climate change,"Australia's marine life is highly diverse and endemic. Here we describe projections of climate change in Australian waters and examine from the literature likely impacts of these changes on Australian marine biodiversity. For the Australian region, climate model simulations project oceanic warming, an increase in ocean stratification and decrease in mixing depth, a strengthening of the East Australian Current, increased ocean acidification, a rise in sea level, alterations in cloud cover and ozone levels altering the levels of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface, and altered storm and rainfall regimes. Evidence of climate change impacts on biological systems are generally scarce in Australia compared to the Northern Hemisphere. The poor observational records in Australia are attributed to a lack of studies of climate impacts on natural systems and species at regional or national scales. However, there are notable exceptions such as widespread bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef and poleward shifts in temperate fish populations. Biological changes are likely to be considerable and to have economic and broad ecological consequences, especially in climate-change 'hot spots' such as the Tasman Sea and the Great Barrier Reef."

climate change,"Global surface temperature has increased ≈0.2°C per decade in the past 30 years, similar to the warming rate predicted in the 1980s in initial global climate model simulations with transient greenhouse gas changes. Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century, and we suggest that the increased West–East temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Niños, such as those of 1983 and 1998. Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within ≈1°C of the maximum temperature of the past million years. We conclude that global warming of more than ≈1°C, relative to 2000, will constitute “dangerous” climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species."
climate change,"Evidence is presented that North Atlantic climate change since 1950 is linked to a progressive warming of tropical sea surface temperatures, especially over the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The ocean changes alter the pattern and magnitude of tropical rainfall and atmospheric heating, the atmospheric response to which includes the spatial structure of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The slow, tropical ocean warming has thus forced a commensurate trend toward one extreme phase of the NAO during the past half-century."
climate change,"The last time we in the United States tried to do anything at the national level about land-use policy was in 1973. That limited effort was a bill (S.268) introduced in the U.S. Senate by Henry Jackson that aimed only to provide funds for those states bold enough to engage in land planning. Toothless though it was the bill was defeated with much patriotic chest thumping. And the Republic still stands—or more properly, sprawls—having reportedly lost an average of one million acres to badly planned “development” each year since and another million or so to soil loss. In truth, we barely keep track of such numbers, preferring to take comfort in the total land reservoir of 2.2 billion acres that has so far buffered us from the consequences of bad judgment and the absence of intelligent planning. But the true costs of land lost to development and agricultural mismanagement are considerably larger even than the little we do count. First, sprawling development requires more roads, wires, pipes, concrete, and materials than more condensed development or “planned unit development.” A 1974 report by the President’s Council on Environmental Quality concluded that “planned development of all densities is less costly to create and operate than sprawl” (CEQ 1974:7). Second, sprawl requires a lot more energy because more people and goods have to move longer distances, which thereby commits this and other landuse intensive nations to use more oil than they otherwise would need, leading to foreign policies predicated on dependence and in turn to belligerence or begging. Third, sprawl was financed primarily on a foundation of sand that is now washing away in a tsunami of bad debt and insolvency. Fourth, sprawl is bad for our health. Children cannot walk to piano practice or school, which begins a vicious cycle that leads to obesity and future health costs in the form of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and less familiar ailments (Frumkin et al. 2004). Fifth, sprawl tends to disconnect children from nature, causing what Richard Louv (2005) calls “nature deficit disorder” and mental problems that arise from the lack of healthy contact with living things. Sixth, sprawl destroys natural habitats and is a main driver of the loss of species. Sometimes smarter development can lessen impacts on wild habitats, but the aggregate effect of any new development is probably never positive. And finally, sprawl contributes to the use of fossil fuels and to the loss of carbon sinks (including forests and soils) that are driving climate change. According to the Fourth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have already raised the temperature of the Earth by 0.8 ◦C and are locked in to another 0.5 to 1.0 ◦C in coming decades no matter what we do in the meantime. Twenty percent of the excess CO2 now in the atmosphere will still be there 1000 years from now. Assuming we summon the wit to cap the warming below a 2.0 ◦C increase, land-use changes, nonetheless, will be dramatic, if still somewhat conjectural. Sea levels will continue to rise, perhaps for another 1000 years, inundating coastal regions. Larger storms will batter coasts, and bigger storm surges will reach farther inland. Midcontinental areas will likely become hotter and drier, possibly leading to the abandonment of millions of acres that were once “breadbaskets.” Rainfall events will become larger with more floods such as those in Iowa in June 2008. More-frequent tornadoes will stress our emergency response and rebuilding capabilities. Some inland lakes will lose much of their present volume, radically altering shorelines. Lake Erie, for one, is projected to lose 40% of its present volume by 2050. Forested regions will be degraded by larger and hotter fires until there is little left to burn. Climate change, in other words, is not so much a problem to be solved once and for all as it is a worsening condition that we will have to endure for a long time to come. John Locke and others from whom we derive our foundational ideas about land law reckoned with none of this. For Locke, land became private property once someone in the distant past mixed their labor with the land. More than 3 centuries after Locke, defenders of private property, such as legal scholar Richard"
climate change,"The interaction of climate and the timing of low tides along the West Coast of the United States creates a complex mosaic of thermal environments, in which northern sites can be more thermally stressful than southern sites. Thus, climate change may not lead to a poleward shift in the distribution of intertidal organisms, as has been proposed, but instead will likely cause localized extinctions at a series of “hot spots.” Patterns of exposure to extreme climatic conditions are temporally variable, and tidal predictions suggest that in the next 3 to 5 years “hot spots” are likely to appear at several northern sites."
climate change,"Measurement of the likely magnitude of the economic impact of climate change on African agriculture has been a challenge. Using data from a survey of more than 9,000 farmers across 11 African countries, a cross-sectional approach estimates how farm net revenues are affected by climate change compared with current mean temperature. Revenues fall with warming for dryland crops (temperature elasticity of -1.9) and livestock (-5.4), whereas revenues rise for irrigated crops (elasticity of 0.5), which are located in relatively cool parts of Africa and are buffered by irrigation from the effects of warming. At first, warming has little net aggregate effect as the gains for irrigated crops offset the losses for dryland crops and livestock. Warming, however, will likely reduce dryland farm income immediately. The final effects will also depend on changes in precipitation, because revenues from all farm types increase with precipitation. Because irrigated farms are less sensitive to climate, where water is available, irrigation is a practical adaptation to climate change in Africa."
climate change,"The possible effects of climate change on the advance of the tree line are considered. As temperature, elevated CO(2) and nitrogen deposition co-vary, it is impossible to disentangle their impacts without performing experiments. However, it does seem very unlikely that photosynthesis per se and, by implication, factors that directly influence photosynthesis, such as elevated CO(2), will be as important as those factors which influence the capacity of the tree to use the products of photosynthesis, such as temperature. Moreover, temperature limits growth more severely than it limits photosynthesis over the temperature range 5-20 degrees C. If it is assumed that growth and reproduction are controlled by temperature, a rapid advance of the tree line would be predicted. Indeed, some authors have provided photographic evidence and remotely sensed data that suggest this is, in fact, occurring. In regions inhabited by grazing animals, the advance of the tree line will be curtailed, although growth of trees below the tree line will of course increase substantially."
climate change,"It is widely recognized that changes are occurring to the earth's climate and, further, that these changes threaten important human interests. This raises the question of who should bear the burdens of addressing global climate change. This paper aims to provide an answer to this question. To do so it focuses on the principle that those who cause the problem are morally responsible for solving it (the ‘polluter pays’ principle). It argues that while this has considerable appeal it cannot provide a complete account of who should bear the burdens of global climate change. It proposes three ways in which this principle needs to be supplemented, and compares the resulting moral theory with the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibility’."
climate change,"The peculiar features of the climate change problem pose substantial obstacles to our ability to make the hard choices necessary to address it. Climate change involves the convergence of a set of global, intergenerational and theoretical problems. This convergence justifies calling it a ʻperfect moral stormʼ. One consequence of this storm is that, even if the other difficult ethical questions surrounding climate change could be answered, we might still find it difficult to act. For the storm makes us extremely vulnerable to moral corruption."
climate change,"Adaptation to climate change is recognized as an important policy issue by international bodies such as the United Nations and by various national governments. Initiatives to identify adaptation needs and to improve adaptive capacity increasingly start with an assessment of the vulnerability of the system of interest, in terms of who and what are vulnerable, to what stresses, in what way, and what capacity exists to adapt to changing risks. Notwithstanding the scholarship on climate change itself, there are few studies on the nature of Arctic communities' vulnerability to climate-change risks. We review existing literature on implications of climate change for Arctic communities, develop a conceptual model of vulnerability, and present an analytical approach to assessing climate hazards and coping strategies in Arctic communities. Vulnerability is conceptualized as a function of exposure to climatic stresses and the adaptive capacity to cope with these stresses. The analytical framework employs place-specific case studies involving community residents and integrates information from multiple sources, both to document current exposures and adaptations and to characterize future exposures and adaptive capacity."
climate change,"▪ Abstract  Research on impacts of climate change on plant diseases has been limited, with most work concentrating on the effects of a single atmospheric constituent or meteorological variable on the host, pathogen, or the interaction of the two under controlled conditions. Results indicate that climate change could alter stages and rates of development of the pathogen, modify host resistance, and result in changes in the physiology of host-pathogen interactions. The most likely consequences are shifts in the geographical distribution of host and pathogen and altered crop losses, caused in part by changes in the efficacy of control strategies. Recent developments in experimental and modeling techniques offer considerable promise for developing an improved capability for climate change impact assessment and mitigation. Compared with major technological, environmental, and socioeconomic changes affecting agricultural production during the next century, climate change may be less important; it will, however, add another layer of complexity and uncertainty onto a system that is already exceedingly difficult to manage on a sustainable basis. Intensified research on climate change-related issues could result in improved understanding and management of plant diseases in the face of current and future climate extremes."
climate change,"Recent observations indicate that climate change over the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere is dominated by a strengthening of the circumpolar westerly flow that extends from the surface to the stratosphere. Here we demonstrate that the seasonality, structure, and amplitude of the observed climate trends are simulated in a state-of-the-art atmospheric model run with high vertical resolution that is forced solely by prescribed stratospheric ozone depletion. The results provide evidence that anthropogenic emissions of ozonedepleting gases have had a distinct impact on climate not only at stratospheric levels but at Earth's surface as well."
climate change,"The film The Day After Tomorrow depicts the abrupt and catastrophic transformation of the Earth’s climate into a new ice age, playing upon the uncertainty surrounding a possible North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (Gulf Stream) shutdown. This paper investigates the impact of the film on people’s perception of climate change through a survey of filmgoers in the UK. Analysis focuses on four issues: the likelihood of extreme impacts; concern over climate change versus other global problems; motivation to take action; and responsibility for the problem of climate change. It finds that seeing the film, at least in the short term, changed people’s attitudes; viewers were significantly more concerned about climate change, and about other environmental risks. However, while the film increased anxiety about environmental risks, viewers experienced difficulty in distinguishing science fact from dramatized science fiction. Their belief in the likelihood of extreme events as a result of climate change was actually reduced. Following the film, many viewers expressed strong motivation to act on climate change. However, although the film may have sensitized viewers and motivated them to act, the public do not have information on what action they can take to mitigate climate change."
climate change,"Climate change is predicted to become a major threat to biodiversity in the 21st century, but accurate predictions and effective solutions have proved difficult to formulate. Alarming predictions have come from a rather narrow methodological base, but a new, integrated science of climate-change biodiversity assessment is emerging, based on multiple sources and approaches. Drawing on evidence from paleoecological observations, recent phenological and microevolutionary responses, experiments, and computational models, we review the insights that different approaches bring to anticipating and managing the biodiversity consequences of climate change, including the extent of species’ natural resilience. We introduce a framework that uses information from different sources to identify vulnerability and to support the design of conservation responses. Although much of the information reviewed is on species, our framework and conclusions are also applicable to ecosystems, habitats, ecological communities, and genetic diversity, whether terrestrial, marine, or fresh water."
climate change,"Abstract Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes are examined in transient climate change simulations performed with the second-generation coupled global climate model of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis. Three-member ensembles were produced for the time period 1990–2100 using the IS92a, A2, and B2 emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The return values of annual extremes are estimated from a fitted generalized extreme value distribution with time-dependent location and scale parameters by the method of maximum likelihood. The L-moment return value estimates are revisited and found to be somewhat biased in the context of transient climate change simulations. The climate response is of similar magnitude in the integrations with the IS92a and A2 emission scenarios but more modest for the B2 scenario. Changes in temperature extremes are largely associated with changes in the location of the distribution of annual extremes without substantial chan..."
climate change,"Weather is of major importance for the population dynamics of birds, but the implications of climate change have only recently begun to be addressed. There is already compelling evidence that birds have been affected by recent climate changes. This review suggests that although there is a substantial body of evidence for changes in the phenology of birds, particularly of the timing of migration and of nesting, the consequences of these responses for a species’ population dynamics is still an area requiring in-depth research. The potential for phenological miscuing (responding inappropriately to climate change, including a lack of response) and for phenological disjunction (in which a bird species becomes out of synchrony with its environment) are beginning to be demonstrated, and are also important areas for further research. The study of climatically induced distributional change is currently at a predictive modelling stage, and will need to develop methods for testing these predictions. Overall, there is a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could potentially inhibit adaptation to climate change and these are a high priority for research."
climate change,"Aim Bioclimatic envelope models are often used to make projections of species' potential responses to climate change. It can be hypothesized that species with different kinds of distributions in environmental niche and geographical space may respond differently to changes in climate. Here, we compare projections of shifts in species ranges with simple descriptors of species niche (position and breadth) and geographical (range size) distributions. Location Europe. Methods The future distribution for 1200 European plant species were predicted by niche-based models using seven climate variables known to have an important role in limiting plant species distributions. Ecological niche properties were estimated using a multivariate analysis. Species range changes were then related to species niche properties using generalized linear models. Results Generally, percentage of remaining suitable habitat in the future increased linearly with niche position and breadth. Increases in potential suitable habitat were associated with greater range size, and had a hump-shaped relationship with niche position on temperature gradient. By relating species chorotypes to percentage of remaining or gained habitat, we highlighted biogeographical patterns of species sensitivity to climate change. These were clearly related to the degree of exposure according to regional patterns of projected climate change. Main conclusion This study highlights general patterns about the relationships between sensitivity of species to climate change and their ecological properties. There is a strong convergence between simple inferences based on ecological characteristics of species and projections by bioclimatic 'envelope' models, confirming macroecological assumptions about species sensitivity based on niche properties. These patterns appear to be most strongly driven by the exposure of species to climate change, with additional effects of species niche characteristics. We conclude that simple species niche properties are powerful indicators of species' sensitivity to climate change."
climate change,"Climate change is only one of many security, environmental and developmental challenges facing Africa. Its impacts will be magnified or moderated by underlying conditions of governance, poverty and resource management, as well as the nature of climate change impacts at local and regional levels. Adaptation policies and programs, if implemented quickly and at multiple scales, could help avert climate change and other environmental stresses becoming triggers for conflict. But, adaptation must take into account existing social, political and economic tensions and avoid exacerbating them. Once it was an environmental issue, then an energy problem, now climate change is being recast as a security threat. So far, the debate has focused on creating a security hook, illustrated by anecdote, to invest climate negotiations with a greater sense of urgency. Political momentum behind the idea of climate change as a security threat has progressed quickly, even reaching the United Nations Security Council. This article reviews the linkages between climate change and security in Africa and analyzes the role of climate change adaptation policies in future conflict prevention. Africa, with its history of ethnic, resource and interstate conflict, is seen by many as particularly vulnerable to this new type of security threat, despite being the continent least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions. Projected climatic changes for Africa suggest a future of increasingly scarce water, collapsing agricultural yields, encroaching desert and damaged coastal infrastructure. Such impacts, should they occur, would undermine the carrying capacity of large parts of Africa, causing destabilizing population movements and raising tensions over dwindling strategic resources. In such cases, climate change could be a factor that tips fragile states into socio-economic and political collapse. Climate change is only one of many security, environmental and developmental challenges facing Africa. Its impacts will be magnified or moderated by underlying conditions of governance, poverty and resource management, as well as the nature of climate change impacts at local and regional levels. Adaptation policies and programs, if implemented quickly and at multiple scales, could help avert climate change and other environmental stresses becoming triggers for conflict. But, adaptation must take into account existing social, political and economic tensions and avoid exacerbating them."

It evaluates further the sensitivity of croplands to any possible changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Location The location is global, geographically explicit. Methods The methods used are spatial data synthesis and analysis and numerical modelling. Results There is a cropland ‘reserve’ of 120%, mainly in tropical South America and Africa. Our climate sensitivity analysis indicates that the southern provinces of Canada, north-western and north-central states of the United States, northern Europe, southern Former Soviet Union and the Manchurian plains of China are most sensitive to changes in temperature. The Great Plains region of the United States and north-eastern China are most sensitive to changes in precipitation. The regions that are sensitive to precipitation change are also sensitive to changes in CO 2 , but the magnitude is small compared to the influence of direct climate change. We estimate that climate change, as simulated by global climate models, will expand cropland suitability by an additional 16%, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. However, the tropics (mainly Africa, northern South America, Mexico and Central America and Oceania) will experience a small decrease in suitability due to climate change. Main conclusions There is a large reserve of cultivable croplands, mainly in tropical South America and Africa. However, much of this land is under valuable forests or in protected areas. Furthermore, the tropical soils could potentially lose fertility very rapidly once the forest cover is removed. Regions that lie at the margins of temperature or precipitation limitation to cultivation are most sensitive to changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 concentration. It is anticipated that climate change will result in an increase in cropland suitability in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (mainly in developed nations), while the tropics will lose suitability (mainly in developing nations)."
climate change,"Very few moral philosophers have written on climate change. This is puzzling, for several reasons. First, many politicians and policy makers claim that climate change is not only the most serious environmental problem currently facing the world, but also one of the most important international problems per se. Second, many of those working in other disciplines describe climate change as fundamentally an ethical issue."
climate change,"Human emissions of greenhouse gases are already changing our climate. This paper provides an overview of the relation between climate change and weather extremes, and examines three specific cases where recent acute events have stimulated debate on the potential role of climate change: the European heatwave of 2003; the risk of inland flooding, such as recently in Central Europe and Great Britain; and the harsh Atlantic hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005. Furthermore, it briefly assesses the relation between climate change and El Nino, and the potential of abrupt climate change. Several trends in weather extremes are sufficiently clear to inform risk reduction efforts. In many instances, however, the potential increases in extreme events due to climate change come on top of alarming rises in vulnerability. Hence, the additional risks due to climate change should not be analysed or treated in isolation, but instead integrated into broader efforts to reduce the risk of natural disasters."
climate change,"The impacts of climate change are already being observed in a variety of sectors and there is greater clarity that these changes are being caused by human activities, mainly through release of greenhouse gases. In 2005 the UK Government hosted the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change conference to take an in-depth look at the scientific issues associated with climate change. This volume presents the most recent findings from the leading international scientists that attended the conference. The topics addressed include critical thresholds and key vulnerabilities of the climate system, impacts on human and natural systems, socioeconomic costs and benefits of emissions pathways, and technological options for meeting different stabilisation levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The volume provides invaluable information for researchers in environmental science, climatology, and atmospheric chemistry, policy-makers in governments and environmental organizations, and scientists and engineers in industry."
climate change,"As a global society, we need to take action not only to prevent the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change but also to adapt to the unavoidable effects of climate change already imposed on the world. Fairness in Adaptation to Climate Change looks at the challenges of ensuring that policy responses to climate change do not place undue and unfair burdens on already vulnerable populations. All countries will be endangered by climate change risks from flood, drought, and other extreme weather events, but developing countries are more dependent on climate-sensitive livelihoods such as farming and fishing and hence are more vulnerable. Despite this, the concerns of developing countries are marginalized in climate policy decisions that exacerbate current vulnerabilities. Fairness in Adaptation to Climate Change brings together scholars from political science, economics, law, human geography, and climate science to offer the first assessment of the social justice issues in adaptation to climate change. The book outlines the philosophical underpinnings of different types of justice in relation to climate change, present inequities, and future burdens, and it applies these to real world examples of climate change adaptation in Bangladesh, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia, and Hungary. It argues that the key to adapting to climate change lies in recognizing the equity and justice issues inherent in its causes and in human responses to it. Contributors:W.

climate change,"It is now widely accepted that global climate change is affecting many ecosystems around the globe and that its impact is increasing rapidly. Many studies predict that impacts will consist largely of shifts in latitudinal and altitudinal distributions. However, we demonstrate that the impacts of global climate change in the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia have the potential to result in many extinctions. We develop bioclimatic models of spatial distribution for the regionally endemic rainforest vertebrates and use these models to predict the effects of climate warming on species distributions. Increasing temperature is predicted to result in significant reduction or complete loss of the core environment of all regionally endemic vertebrates. Extinction rates caused by the complete loss of core environments are likely to be severe, nonlinear, with losses increasing rapidly beyond an increase of 2°C, and compounded by other climate–related impacts. Mountain ecosystems around the world, such as the Australian Wet Tropics bioregion, are very diverse, often with high levels of restricted endemism, and are therefore important areas of biodiversity. The results presented here suggest that these systems are severely threatened by climate change."
climate change,"Our current understanding of mechanisms that are, or may be, acting to cause climate change over the past century is briefly reviewed, with an emphasis on those due to human activity. The paper discusses the general level of confidence in these estimates and areas of remaining uncertainty. The effects of increases in the so-called well-mixed greenhouse gases, and in particular carbon dioxide, appear to be the dominant mechanism. However, there are considerable uncertainties in our estimates of many other forcing mechanisms; those associated with the so-called indirect aerosol forcing (whereby changes in aerosols can impact on cloud properties) may be the most serious, as its climatic effect may be of a similar size as, but opposite sign to, that due to carbon dioxide. The possible role of volcanic eruptions as a natural climate change mechanism is also highlighted."
climate change,"Climate change simulations made with coupled global climate models typically show a marked hemispheric asymmetry with more warming in the northern high latitudes than in the south. This asymmetry is ascribed to heat uptake by the ocean at high southern latitudes. A recent version of the CCCma climate model exhibits a much more symmetric warming, compared to an earlier version, and agrees somewhat better with observed 20th century trends. This is associated with an improved parameterization of ocean mixing which results in a decrease in heat penetration into the Southern Ocean, in accord with earlier ocean‐only and simple coupled model investigations. The global average warming and the net penetration of heat into the global ocean (and hence its thermal expansion) are essentially unchanged. Observed trends in sea‐ice extent over the past two decades exhibit hemispheric asymmetry with a statistically significant decrease in northern but not in southern ice cover. Both model versions are consistent with these observations implying that observed ice extent is not yet an indicator of asymmetry in future global warming. Taken together, these results suggest that southern hemisphere climate warming at a rate comparable to that in the northern hemisphere should be considered a realistic possiblity."
climate change,"Summary 1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species’ responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species’ interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications . While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, wellplanned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change."
climate change,"This paper reports the results of a series of research projects which have aimed to evaluate the implications of climate change for food production and risk of hunger. There are three sets of results: (a) for IS92a (previously described as a ‘business-as-usual’ climate scenario); (b) for stabilization scenarios at 550 and 750 ppm and (c) for Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). The main conclusions are: (i) the region of greatest risk is Africa; (ii) stabilization at 750 ppm avoids some but not most of the risk, while stabilization at 550 ppm avoids most of the risk and (iii) the impact of climate change on risk of hunger is influenced greatly by pathways of development. For example, a SRES B2 development pathway is characterized by much lower levels of risk than A2; and this is largely explained by differing levels of income and technology not by differing amounts of climate forcing."
climate change,"Climatic factors influence the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases, in addition to multiple human, biological, and ecological determinants. Climatologists have identified upward trends in global temperatures and now estimate an unprecedented rise of 2.0 degrees C by the year 2100. Of major concern is that these changes can affect the introduction and dissemination of many serious infectious diseases. The incidence of mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, dengue, and viral encephalitides, are among those diseases most sensitive to climate. Climate change would directly affect disease transmission by shifting the vector's geographic range and increasing reproductive and biting rates and by shortening the pathogen incubation period. Climate-related increases in sea surface temperature and sea level can lead to higher incidence of water-borne infectious and toxin-related illnesses, such as cholera and shellfish poisoning. Human migration and damage to health infrastructures from the projected increase in climate variability could indirectly contribute to disease transmission. Human susceptibility to infections might be further compounded by malnutrition due to climate stress on agriculture and potential alterations in the human immune system caused by increased flux of ultraviolet radiation. Analyzing the role of climate in the emergence of human infectious diseases will require interdisciplinary cooperation among physicians, climatologists, biologists, and social scientists. Increased disease surveillance, integrated modeling, and use of geographically based data systems will afford more anticipatory measures by the medical community. Understanding the linkages between climatological and ecological change as determinants of disease emergence and redistribution will ultimately help optimize preventive strategies."
climate change,"Abstract A framework is presented to quantify observed changes in climate within the contiguous United States through the development and analysis of two indices of climate change, a Climate Extremes Index (CEI) and a U.S. Greenhouse Climate Response Index (GCRI). The CEI is based on an aggregate set of conventional climate extreme indicators, and the GCRI is composed of indicators that measure changes in the climate of the United States that have been projected to occur as a result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases. The CEI supports the notion that the climate of the United States has become more extreme in recent decades, yet the magnitude and persistence of the changes are not large enough at this point to conclude that the increase in extremes reflects a nonstationary climate. Nonetheless, if impacts due to extreme events rise exponentially with the index, then the increase may be quite significant in a practical sense. Similarly, the positive trend of the U.S. GCRI during the twentieth centu..."
climate change,"Climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity. Concern over the poten- tial effects of long-term climatic change on agriculture has motivated a substantial body of research over the past decade. This body of research addresses possible physical effects of climatic change on agriculture, such as changes in crop and livestock yields, as well as the economic consequences of these potential yield changes. This paper reviews the extant literature on these physical and economic effects and interprets this research in terms of common themes or findings. Of particular interest are findings concerning the role of human adaptations in responding to climate change, possible regional impacts to agricultural systems and potential changes in patterns of food production and prices. Limi- tations and sensitivities of these findings are discussed and key areas of uncertainty are highlighted. Finally, some speculations regarding issues of potential importance in interpreting and using informa- tion on climate change and agriculture are presented."
climate change,"Fundamental plant–environment relationships were revealed by analyses of 20-yr height and survival of 118 populations representing two subspecies of Pinus contorta growing in common gardens at 60 environmentally disparate test sites in British Columbia. The approach involved (1) preparing models that described the general climate of British Columbia, (2) developing population-specific response functions driven by predicted climate variables, (3) developing general transfer functions that predict performance from the climatic distances over which populations were transferred, and (4) interpreting the results in terms of niche breadth, effects of climate change on adaptedness of populations, and reforestation in a changing environment. 
 
Polynomial regression models used physiographic descriptors to predict seven climate variables from normalized records of 513 weather stations. Values of R2 ranged over 0.80–0.97 for thermal variables and 0.54–0.61 for precipitation variables. Validations with independent data from 45 stations were strong and suggested that the models were generally free of bias within the limits of the original data. 
 
Response functions describing the height or survival of each population were developed from quadratic regressions using predicted climate variables for each test site. Mean annual temperature and mean temperature in the coldest month were the most effective variables for predicting population height, while the ratio of summer temperature to summer moisture was the best predictor of survival. Validation of the response functions with independent data from two additional test sites produced values of R2 between actual and predicted values that were as high as 0.93 for height and 0.73 for survival. The results demonstrated that natural populations have different climatic optima but tend to occupy suboptimal environments. Nevertheless, the general transfer functions showed that optimal growth and survival of the species as a whole is associated with the null transfer distance. 
 
These seemingly anomalous results suggest that the same processes thought to determine the distribution of species control the distribution of genotypes within species: (1) environmental selection to produce a broad fundamental niche, and (2) density-dependent selection to produce a relatively narrow realized niche within which most populations are relegated to suboptimal environments. Consequently, the steep geographic clines typical of P. contorta seem to be driven more by density-dependent selection than by environmental selection. Asymmetric gene flow from the center of distribution toward the periphery is viewed as a primary regulator that provides the fuel for both environmental and density-dependent selection and thereby indirectly perpetuates suboptimality. 
 
The response functions predict that small changes in climate will greatly affect growth and survival of forest tree populations and, therefore, that maintaining contemporary forest productivities during global warming will require a wholesale redistribution of genotypes across the landscape. The response functions also provide the climatic bases to current reforestation guidelines and quantify the adjustments necessary for maintaining adaptedness in planted trees during periods of small (∼1°C) temporal temperature shifts."
climate change,"The rapidly increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may lead to significant changes in regional and seasonal climate patterns. Such changes can strongly influence the diversity and distribution of species and, therefore, affect ecosystems and biodiversity. To assess these changes we developed a model, called euromove. The model uses climate data from 1990 to 2050 as compiled from the image 2 model, and determines climate envelopes for about 1400 plant species by multiple logistic regression analysis. The climate envelopes were applied to the projected climate to obtain predictions about plant diversity and distributions by 2050. For each European grid cell, euromove calculates which species would still occur in forecasted future climate conditions and which not. The results show major changes in biodiversity by 2050. On average, 32% of the European plant species that were present in a cell in 1990 would disappear from that cell. The area, in which 32% or more of the 1990 species will disappear, takes up 44% of the modelled European area. Individual responses of the plant species to the forecasted climate change were diverse. In reviewing possible future trends, we found that plant species, in general, would find their current climate envelopes further northeast by 2050, shifting ranges that were comparable with those ranges in other studies."
climate change,"Data from a national butterfly monitoring scheme were analysed to test for relationships between temperature and three phenological measures, duration of flight period and timing of both first and peak appearance. First appearances of most British butterflies has advanced in the last two decades and is strongly related to earlier peak appearance and, for multibrooded species, longer flight period. Mean dates of first and peak appearance are examined in relation to Manley's central England temperatures, using regression techniques. We predict that, in the absence of confounding factors, such as interactions with other organisms and land‐use change, climate warming of the order of 1 °C could advance first and peak appearance of most butterflies by 2–10 days."
climate change,"Recent investigations have shown that the extent of the channel network in some drainage basins is controlled by a threshold for overland flow erosion. The sensitivity of such basins to climate change is analyzed using a physically based model of drainage basin evolution. The GOLEM model simulates basin evolution under the action of weathering processes, hillslope transport, and fluvial bedrock erosion and sediment transport. Results from perturbation analyses reveal that the nature and timescale of basin response depends on the direction of change. An increase in runoff intensity (or a decrease in vegetation cover) will lead to a rapid expansion of the channel network, with the resulting increase in sediment supply initially generating aggradation along the main network, followed by downcutting as the sediment supply tapers off. By contrast, a decrease in runoff intensity (or an increase in the erosion threshold) will lead to a retraction of the active channel network and a much more gradual geomorphic response. Cyclic changes in runoff intensity are shown to produce aggradational‐degradational cycles that resemble those observed in the field. Cyclic variations in runoff also lead to highly punctuated denudation rates, with denudation concentrated during periods of increasing runoff intensity and/or decreasing vegetation cover. The sediment yield from threshold‐dominated basins may therefore exhibit significant variability in response to relatively subtle environmental changes, a finding which underscores the need for caution in interpreting modern sediment‐yield data."
climate change,The need for climate change information at the regional-to-local scale is one of the central issues within the global change debate. Such information is necessary in order to assess the impacts of climate change on human and natural systems and to develop suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies at the national level. The end-user and policy-making communities have long sought reliable regionaland local-scale projections to provide a solid basis for guiding response options.
climate change,"Adaptation in forestry is sustainable forest management that includes a climate change focus. Climate change over the next 100 years is expected to have significant impacts on forest ecosystems. The forestry community needs to evaluate the long-term effects of climate change on forests and determine what the community might do now and in the future to respond to this threat. Management can influence the timing and direction of forest adaptation at selected locations, but in many situations society will have to adjust to however forests adapt. Adapting to climate change in the face of the uncertain timing of impacts means we must have a suite of readily available options. A high priority will be coping with and adapting to forest disturbance while maintaining the genetic diversity and resilience of forest ecosystems. A framework for facilitating adaptation in forestry is discussed and a review of adaptive actions presented."
climate change,"This study addresses the specific challenges which indigenous peoples face as a consequence of climate change and related policy response measures. Generally, the approach is based on the concept that human vulnerability to the impacts of climate change (and to the potential impacts of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures) depends on a range of factors that so far have not been examined in great detail. In order to reduce the vulnerability of indigenous peoples to climate change impacts, responses need to be rooted in an understanding of indigenous people’s rights as human beings and as peoples. This demands coordination with a range of instruments and processes, including the United Nations Permanent Forum on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Forum, together with several inter-governmental and nongovernmental processes and institutions, has been active in promoting approaches that take account of the rights of indigenous peoples.

climate change,"Large ice sheets actively interact with the rest of the climate system by amplifying, pacing, and potentially driving global climate change over several time scales. Direct and indirect influences of ice sheets on climate cause changes in ocean surface temperatures, ocean circulation, continental water balance, vegetation, and land-surface albedo, which in turn cause additional feedbacks in the climate system and help to synchronize global climate change. The effect of the underlying geological substrate on ice-sheet dynamics may be the missing link in understanding the ice sheet–climate interactions that are integral to the middle Pleistocene transition; the 100,000-year climate cycle; high-amplitude, millennial-scale climate variability; and low–aspect ratio ice sheets of the Last Glacial Maximum."
climate change,"It is pointed out that the release of chemicals into the atmosphere has grown greatly over the last 50 years. Contributed to the observed perturbations of trace chemicals in the atmosphere have an increased reliance on synthetic chemicals, deforestation, biomass burning, and fossil fuel combustion. As trace chemicals modify the radiation energy of the earth-atmosphere system, the considered developments can produce an alteration of the earth's climate. One of the major objectives of the present study is related to the characterization of the trace gases, taking into account the observed abundances, known sources, and sinks in the present-day atmosphere. Other objectives include an estimate of the future concentration of trace gases, an inference of the preindustrial concentrations of trace gases, and an estimate of the radiative effects of the trace gases and their potentials for climate changes. 103 references."

climate change,"There is growing consensus that the populations, infrastructure and ecology of cities are at risk from the impacts of climate change. This review collates evidence of effects in four main areas: urban ventilation and cooling, urban drainage and flood risk, water resources, and outdoor spaces (including air quality and biodiversity). It is shown that built areas exert considerable influence over their local climate and environment, and that urban populations are already facing a range of weather related risks such as heat waves, air pollution episodes and flooding. Although climate change is expected to compound these problems, building designers and spatial planners are responding through improved building design and layout of cities. For example, green roofs and spaces provide multiple benefits for air quality, mitigating excessive heat and enhancing biodiversity. Hard engineering solutions will continue to play a role in adapting to climate change, but so too will improved forecasting and preparedness, along with risk avoidance through planning controls. There is also an over-arching need for higher-resolution weather data for testing future performance of buildings, urban drainage and water supply systems at city scales."
climate change,"Images of melting glaciers have come to dominate the pictorial language of climate change. This paper argues that photographs of melting glaciers engender a representational problem in the communication of climate change as they depict the already seen effects of climate change. Given the dominance of the photograph within Greenpeace campaigns, the paper examines this adherence to visual immediacy by analysing Greenpeace climate change campaign literature since 1994. Identifying five representational phases over the last decade, the analysis shows how a symbolic pictorial language of climate change was being created, and the ways in which risks were communicated as actual rather than potential. Understood retrospectively however, this visualisation calls attention to the problems of communicating environmental issues of a temporal (long term) and unseen nature through a medium of representation which privileges the ‘here and now’."
climate change,"Local Speeding Early responses of species to climate change seemed to predict a general poleward response (or upward in mountains and downward in the ocean). Pinsky et al. (p. 1239) test an alternative hypothesis that relates more to the nature of climate change than to changes in temperature. Using nearly 50 years of coastal survey data on >350 marine taxa, they found that climate velocity was a much better predictor of patterns of change than individual species' characteristics or life histories. The findings suggest that responses to climate change largely track changes in local conditions. Variation in species’ responses to climate change can be explained by differences in the local rates of climate change. Organisms are expected to adapt or move in response to climate change, but observed distribution shifts span a wide range of directions and rates. Explanations often emphasize biological distinctions among species, but general mechanisms have been elusive. We tested an alternative hypothesis: that differences in climate velocity—the rate and direction that climate shifts across the landscape—can explain observed species shifts. We compiled a database of coastal surveys around North America from 1968 to 2011, sampling 128 million individuals across 360 marine taxa. Climate velocity explained the magnitude and direction of shifts in latitude and depth much more effectively than did species characteristics. Our results demonstrate that marine species shift at different rates and directions because they closely track the complex mosaic of local climate velocities."
climate change,"A phenological study of springtime events was made over a 61-year period at one site in southern Wisconsin. The records over this long period show that several phenological events have been increasing in earliness; we discuss evidence indicating that these changes reflect climate change. The mean of regressions for the 55 phenophases studied was -0.12 day per year, an overall increase in phenological earliness at this site during the period. Some phenophases have not increased in earliness, as would be expected for phenophases that are regulated by photoperiod or by a physiological signal other than local temperature."
climate change,"Bangladesh is likely to be one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change. This paper discusses the possible impacts of climate change in Bangladesh through tropical cyclones, storm surges, coastal erosion and back water effect. The possible increase in cyclone fre- quency in the Bay of Bengal, lying south of Bangladesh, due to climate change is looked at by analyz- ing the cyclone data for 119 yr. Both qualitative and quantitative discussions are made on cyclone intensity increase for a sea surface temperature rise of 2 and 4°C. Different scenarios of storm surges under different climate change conditions are developed by using a numerical model of storm surges for the Bay of Bengal. Possible loss of land through beach erosion due to sea level rise on the eastern coast of Bangladesh is examined. Some discussions are also made on the impacts of back water effect due to sea level rise on flood situations in the country. Finally, a few remarks are made on the adapta- tion options for Bangladesh in the event of climate change."
climate change,"Monetised estimates of the impact of climate change are derived. Impacts are expressed as functions of climate change and 'vulnerability'. Vulnerability is measured by a series of indicators, such as per capita income, population above 65, and economic structure. Impacts are estimated for nine world regions, for the period 2000-2200, for agriculture, forestry, water resources, energy consumption, sea level rise, ecosystems, fatal vector- borne diseases, and fatal cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. Uncertainties are large, often including sign switches. In the short term, the estimated sensitivity of a sector to climate change is found to be the crucial parameter. In the longer term, the change in the vulnerability of the sector is often more important for the total impact. Impacts can be negative or positive, depending on the time, region, and sector one is looking at. Negative impacts tend to dominate in the later years and in the poorer regions."
climate change,"Recently, there has been increasing evidence of species' range shifts due to changes in climate. Whereas most of these shifts relate ground truth biogeographic data to a general warming trend in regional or global climate data, we here present a reanalysis of both biogeographic and bioclimatic data of equal spatio-temporal resolution, covering a time span of more than 50 years. Our results reveal a coherent and synchronous shift in both species' distribution and climate. They show not only a shift in the northern margin of a species, which is in concert with gradually increasing winter temperatures in the area, they also confirm the simulated species' distribution changes expected from a bioclimatic model under the recent, relatively moderate climate change."
climate change,"Land-use change is related to climate change as both a causal factor and a major way in which the effects of climate change are expressed. As a causal factor, land use influences the flux of mass and energy, and as land-cover patterns change, these fluxes are altered. Projected climate alterations will produce changes in land-cover patterns at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, although human uses of the land are expected to override many effects. A review of the literature dealing with the relationship between land-use change and climate change clearly shows that (1) in recent centuries land-use change has had much greater effects on ecological variables than has climate change; (2) the vast majority of land-use changes have little to do with climate change or even climate; and (3) humans will change land use, and especially land management, to adjust to climate change and these adaptations will have some ecological effects. Therefore, an understanding of the nonclimatic causes of land-use change ..."
climate change,"Climate change is expected to alter the distribution and abundance of many species. Predictions of climate-induced population extinctions are supported by geographic range shifts that correspond to climatic warming, but few extinctions have been linked mechanistically to climate change. Here we show that extinctions of two populations of a checkerspot butterfly were hastened by increasing variability in precipitation, a phenomenon predicted by global climate models. We model checkerspot populations to show that changes in precipitation amplified population fluctuations, leading to rapid extinctions. As populations of checkerspots and other species become further isolated by habitat loss, climate change is likely to cause more extinctions, threatening both species diversity and critical ecosystem services."
climate change,"Aim Conservation strategies currently include little consideration of climate change. Insights about the biotic impacts of climate change from biogeography and palaeoecology, therefore, have the potential to provide significant improvements in the effectiveness of conservation planning. We suggest a collaboration involving biogeography, ecology and applied conservation. The resulting Climate Change-integrated Conservation Strategies (CCS) apply available tools to respond to the conservation challenges posed by climate change. Location The focus of this analysis is global, with special reference to high biodiversity areas vulnerable to climate change, particularly tropical montane settings. Methods Current tools from climatology, biogeography and ecology applicable to conservation planning in response to climate change are reviewed. Conservation challenges posed by climate change are summarized. CCS elements are elaborated that use available tools to respond to these challenges. Results Five elements of CCS are described: regional modelling; expanding protected areas; management of the matrix; regional coordination; and transfer of resources. Regional modelling uses regional climate models, biotic response models and sensitivity analysis to identify climate change impacts on biodiversity at a regional scale appropriate for conservation planning. Expansion of protected areas management and systems within the planning region are based on modelling results. Management of the matrix between protected areas provides continuity for processes and species range shifts outside of parks. Regional coordination of park and off-park efforts allows harmonization of conservation goals across provincial and national boundaries. Finally, implementation of these CCS elements in the most biodiverse regions of the world will require technical and financial transfer of resources on a global scale. Main conclusions Collaboration across disciplines is necessary to plan conservation responses to climate change adequately. Biogeography and ecology provide insights into the effects of climate change on biodiversity that have not yet been fully integrated into conservation biology and applied conservation management. CCS provide a framework in which biogeographers, ecologists and conservation managers can collaborate to address this need. These planning exercises take place on a regional level, driven by regional climate models as well as general circulation models (GCMs), to ensure that regional climate drivers such as land use change and mesoscale topography are adequately represented. Sensitivity analysis can help address the substantial uncertainty inherent in projecting future climates and biodiversity response."

climate change,"This paper studies the economic implications of climate-change-induced variations in tourism demand, using a world CGE model. The model is first re-calibrated at some future years, obtaining hypothetical benchmark equilibria, which are subsequently perturbed by shocks, simulating the effects of climate change. We portray the impact of climate change on tourism by means of two sets of shocks, occurring simultaneously. The first shocks translate predicted variations in tourist flows into changes of consumption preferences for domestically produced goods. The second shocks reallocate income across world regions, simulating the effect of higher or lower tourists’ expenditure. Our analysis highlights that variations in tourist flows will affect regional economies in a way that is directly related to the sign and magnitude of flow variations. At a global scale, climate change will ultimately lead to a welfare loss, unevenly spread across regions."
climate change,"The challenge of agriculture in the 21st century requires a systemic integration of the environmental, social and economic pillars of development to meet the needs of present generations without sacrificing the livelihoods of future generations. Over the next 50 years, the world population is projected to increase by some 3 billion, primarily in the developing countries. Yet, even today, some 800 million people go hungry daily, and more than a billion live on less than a dollar a day. This food insecurity and poverty affecting one-quarter of the world's population is a sad indictment of the failure to respond adequately in a time of unprecedented scientific progress and economic development. There is no way we can meet food security and poverty concerns without first addressing the issues of sustainable agricultural and rural development. 
 
The methodology and results reported in this study form a first comprehensive and integrated global ecological-economic assessment of the impact of climate change on agro-ecosystems in the context of the world food and agricultural system. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) have developed a comprehensive methodology based on environmental principles, referred to as the agro-ecological zones methodology. This GIS-based framework combines crop modeling and environmental matching procedures to identify crop-specific environmental limitations under various levels of inputs and management conditions. This has facilitated comprehensive and geographically detailed assessments of climate-change impacts and agricultural vulnerability. 
 
The sensitivity of agro-ecosystems to climate change, as determined by the FAO/IIASA Agro-ecological Zones (AEZ) model, was assessed within the socio-economic scenarios defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions (SRES). For this purpose, IIASA's global linked model of the world food system was used. This modeling framework, referred to as the Basic Linked System (BLS), comprises a representation of all major economic sectors, and views national agricultural systems as embedded in national economies, which in turn interact with each other at the international level. 
 
The BLS is a global general equilibrium model system for analyzing agricultural policies and food system prospects in an international setting. BLS views national agricultural systems as embedded in national economies, which interact with each other through financial flows and trade at the international level. The national models linked in the BLS cover about 80% of the most important attributes related to the world food system, such as population, land, agricultural production, demand, and trade. The remaining countries of the world are grouped into 14 regional models to provide closure for the world system, both geographically and economically. The national models simulate the behavior of producers, consumers, and the government. They distinguish two broad sectors: agriculture and non-agriculture. Agriculture produces nine aggregate commodities. 
 
The combination of AEZ and BLS provides an integrated ecological-economic framework for the assessment of the impact of climate change. We consider climate scenarios based on experiments with four General Circulation Models (GCM), and we assess the four basic socioeconomic development pathways and emission scenarios as formulated by the IPCC in its Third Assessment Report. 
 
The main results of the study include climate-change impacts on the prevalence of environmental constraints to crop agriculture; climate variability and the variability of rain-fed cereal production; changes in potential agricultural land; changes in crop production patterns; and the impact of climate change on cereal production potential. Results of the AEZ-BLS integrated ecological-economic analysis of climate change on the world food system includes quantification of scale and location of hunger, international agricultural trade, prices, production, land use, etc. The analysis assesses trends in food production, trade, and consumption, and the impact on poverty and hunger of alternative development pathways and varying levels of climate change. 
 
The methodology and database developed in this study provides a foundation for detailed country studies, incorporating country-level information. The climate change issue is global, long term and involves complex interaction between climatic, environmental, economic, political, institutional, social and technological processes. It has significant international and intergenerational implications in the context of equity and sustainable development. Climate change will impact on social, economic and environmental systems and shape prospects for sustainable agricultural and rural development. Adaptation to climate change is essential to complement climate change mitigation, and both have to be central to an integrated strategy to reduce risks and impacts of climate change. 
 
Most of the discussion on climate change has focused on mitigation measures, for example the Kyoto Protocol. Not much attention has been given to climate change adaptation, which will be critical for many developing countries. The developing world has not realized that this issue needs to be on the global agenda and for developed countries this is not a priority, as they have the means and resources to adapt to future climate change. 
 
National governments and the international community must give agriculture and rural sector the highest priority in terms of resource allocation and adoption of development polices that are locally relevant and globally consistent. Only then progress can be made to eradicate hunger and poverty in the world."

 argue that these carbon uptake estimates are too high because the models do not take other nutrients such as nitrogen into account appropriately. The authors estimate that there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios. Nutrients other than nitrogen may also affect carbon uptake in ways not captured by most models."
climate change,"An overview is presented of the principal features of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections in terms of regional patterns of surface temperature, precipitation and mid‐tropospheric atmospheric circulation. The discussion is cast in the context of variations in the associations over time, with decadal scale changes emphasized. In the five decades or so for which we have adequate records to reliably analyse the global aspects of ENSO effects on regional climates around the world, we have witnessed one major decadal scale change in the overall pattern of sea‐surface temperatures (SST) in the global ocean, and concomitant changes in the atmospheric response to those changes. The analysis underscores the connection between low frequency changes in tropical SST, ENSO and decadal scale changes in the general atmospheric circulation, pointing to the complex interplay between the canonical ENSO system, slow changes in SST in the Indo‐Pacific over the last century, and long‐term changes in the atmospheric circulation itself.

climate change,"Switzerland's economy depends heavily on tourism. For many alpine areas in the coun- try, winter tourism is the most important source of income, and snow-reliability is one of the key ele- ments of the offers made by tourism in the Alps. The financial viability of winter tourism, however, depends on sufficient snow conditions. The lack of snow at the end of the 1980s left a lasting imprint on the tourism industry. If the assumptions of the impacts of climate change hold true, snow cover in the Swiss Alps will diminish, and this will, in turn, jeopardise the tourism industry. 85% of Switzer- land's current ski resorts can be designated as snow-reliable. If climate change occurs, the level of snow-reliability will rise from 1200 m up to 1800 m over the next few decades. Only 44% of the ski resorts would then still be snow-reliable. While some regions may be able to maintain their winter tourism with suitable adaptation strategies, others would lose all winter tourism due to a diminishing snow pack. Despite global warming, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of winters with heavy snowfall in the future (e.g. the winter of 1998/99, particularly February 1999). Climate change must be viewed as a catalyst that is reinforcing and accelerating the pace of structural changes in tourism. Today, adaptation strategies are predominant in tourism (e.g. artificial snow production). As an industry that will be severely affected by climate change, however, tourism will increasingly have to focus on mitigation strategies (e.g. less greenhouse gas emissions by tourism traffic)."
climate change,"Abstract The intensive research of recent years on climate change has led to the strong conclusion that climate has always, throughout the Earth's history, changed irregularly on all time scales. Climate changes are closely related to the Hurst phenomenon, which has been detected in many long hydroclimatic time series and is stochastically equivalent to a simple scaling behaviour of climate variability over time scale. The climate variability, anthropogenic or natural, increases the uncertainty of the hydrological processes. It is shown that hydrological statistics, the branch of hydrology that deals with uncertainty, in its current state is not consistent with the varying character of climate. Typical statistics used in hydrology such as means, variances, cross- and autocorrelations and Hurst coefficients, and the variability thereof, are revisited under the hypothesis of a varying climate following a simple scaling law, and new estimators are studied which, in many cases, differ dramatically from the classical ones. The new statistical framework is applied to real-world examples for typical tasks such as estimation and hypothesis testing where, again, the results depart significantly from those of the classical statistics."
climate change,"The UNEP Handbook on Methods for Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Strategies provides an elaboration of the IPCC Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations. This paper presents the concepts and ideas that underpin the chapter Coastal Zones of the UNEP Handbook. Particular emphasis is given to the conceptual framework, which is centered around the concept of vulnerability. Further, the IPCC Common Methodology for Assessing Coastal Vulnerability to Sea-Level Rise is evaluated and compared with the Technical Guidelines. One notable difference between the 2 approaches concerns the use of scenarios. In the Common Methodology scenarios are prescribed, while the Technical Guidelines allow users maximum freedom in selecting and developing scenarios. Finally, the paper discusses 3 levels of increasingly complex assessment in coastal zones. As more experience is acquired, coastal databases improve and better analytical tools and techniques are developed, more comprehensive and integrated assessments will become feasible."

climate change,"Abstract. Global climates have been changing, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, throughout the evolutionary history of amphibians. Therefore, existing amphibian species have been derived from those that have survived major climatic disturbances. Although recent global climate change has resulted in warming in many regions, temperatures in some areas to date have not changed measurably, or have even cooled. Declines of some amphibian populations have been correlated with climate events, but demonstrations of direct causal relationships need further research. Data are available indicating some indirect effect of climate change on the initiation of breeding activities of some amphibians that occur earlier than in previous springs, but the costs and benefits of these changes are just beginning to be investigated. Climate may also play an indirect role in facilitating epidemics of infectious disease. Regardless of the role that climate changes may have played in past and current amphibian declines, future shifts in climate, should they prove as dramatic as predicted, will certainly pose challenges for surviving amphibian populations and for successful recovery efforts of species that have suffered declines."
climate change,"The definition of desertification accepted in the ad hoc conference held by UNEP in Nairobi in 1977 and confirmed at the Earth Summit on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 is: ‘arid, semi-arid and dry-subhumid land degradation’. There is no global long-term trend in any rainfall change over the period of instrumental record (c. 150 years), but there has been an increase of 0·5°C in global temperature over the past 100 years. This increase seems partly due to urbanization, as there is no evidence of it resulting from atmospheric pollution by CO2and other warming gases (SO2, NO2, CH4, CFH etc.). On the other hand, the thermal increase is uneven, increasing with latitudes above 40° N and S. The increase is only slight or non-existent in subtropical and inter-tropical latitudes where most arid and semi-arid lands lie. This, incidently, is consistent with Global Circulation Models (GCM) — derived scenarios. The study of tree-rings, lake level fluctuations and pollen analysis confirm the existence of climatic fluctuations, but with no long-term trends over the past 2000 years. 
 
A possible increase of 1–3°C in arid lands over the next 50 years due to a doubling of the CO2content of the lower atmosphere to 700 p.p.m., as assumed by most scenarios stemming from GCM, would increase global potential evapo-transpiration (PET) by some 75–225 mm year−1. The ratio of mean annual precipitation to PET would then decrease by about 4–5%, assuming that no substantial changes in rainfall took place in arid and semi-arid lands. However, the impact of CO2on plants would boost photosynthesis and, therefore, primary productivity; it would also increase water-use efficiency via the reduction of stomatal conductance. It is therefore at present difficult to predict the net balance of these two opposite consequences or to prophesy which phenomenon would prevail: increased aridity or higher productivity and more efficient water use. At all events, the possible effect of a climatic fluctuation (or change) of the magnitude envisaged would have a trivial consequence on arid environments, as compared with the past and present impact of humans and their livestock. 
 
Drought has always been a normal recurrent event in arid and semi-arid lands. Strategies and tactics to mitigate its consequences via improved land-use and management practices are analysed."
climate change,"Detailed investigations of high latitude sequences recently collected by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) indicate that periods of rapid climate change often culminated in brief transient climates, with more extreme conditions than subsequent long term climates. Two examples of such events have been identified in the Paleogene; the first in latest Paleocene time in the middle of a warming trend that began several million years earlier: the second in earliest Oligocene time near the end of a Middle Eocene to Late Oligocene global cooling trend. Superimposed on the earlier event was a sudden and extreme warming of both high latitude sea surface and deep ocean waters. Imbedded in the latter transition was an abrupt decline in high latitude temperatures and the brief appearance of a full size continental ice-sheet on Antarctica. In both cases the climate extremes were not stable, lasting for less than a few hundred thousand years, indicating a temporary or transient climate state. Geochemical and sedimentological evidence suggest that both Paleogene climate events were accompanied by reorganizations in ocean circulation, and major perturbations in marine productivity and the global carbon cycle. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum was marked by reduced oceanic turnover and decreases in global $$\delta^{13}C $$ and in marine productivity, while the Early Oligocene glacial maximum was accompanied by intensification of deep ocean circulation and elevated $$\delta^{13}C $$ and productivity. It has been suggested that sudden changes in climate and/or ocean circulation might occur as a result of gradual forcing as certain physical thresholds are exceeded. We investigate the possibility that sudden reorganizations in ocean and/or atmosphere circulation during these abrupt transitions generated short-term positive feedbacks that briefly sustained these transient climatic states."

Choices about land-use and land-cover patterns have affected and will continue to affect how vulnerable or resilient human communities and ecosystems are to the effects of climate change. 2. Land-use and land-cover changes affect local, regional, and global climate processes. 3.

Choices about land use and land management provide a means of reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels."
climate change,"Species-energy theory indicates that recent climate warming should have driven increases in species richness in cool and species-poor parts of the Northern Hemisphere. We confirm that the average species richness of British butterflies has increased since 1970–82, but much more slowly than predicted from changes of climate: on average, only one-third of the predicted increase has taken place. The resultant species assemblages are increasingly dominated by generalist species that were able to respond quickly. The time lag is confirmed by the successful introduction of many species to climatically suitable areas beyond their ranges. Our results imply that it may be decades or centuries before the species richness and composition of biological communities adjusts to the current climate."

climate change,"HUMANS ARE NOW MAKING UNprecedented changes to the global environment. Economic development has been fostered by the use of fossil fuels but the accompanying accumulation of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, has implications for the world’s climate (BOX). Since the 1850s when temperature records began, the world has warmed by approximately 0.6°C, largely in the last 3 decades. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects an increase of between 1.8°C and 5.8°C and an increase in sea levels between 9 and 88 cm during the next century. Warming is likely to be greater at the poles than at the equator. The residence time in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide exceeds 100 years; therefore, our actions affect the prospects of future generations. The IPCC concluded, “There is now good evidence that regional changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, have already affected a diverse set of physical and biological systems in many parts of the world.” Earlier break-up of ice on rivers and lakes and movements of plant and animal ranges to higher altitudes are some examples. There is also potential for large-scale and potentially irreversible changes in Earth systems, such as slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the North Atlantic, large-scale melting of the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, and accelerated global warming because of the positive feedbacks of the carbon cycle (eg, methane released from thawing arctic tundra). The probability of these events may be very low but is likely to be affected by the speed and duration of climate change. The potential pathways by which climate change may affect health are shown in the FIGURE."

Attention is paid to the microclimate of glaciers and the physical processes regulating the exchange of energy and mass between glacier surface and atmosphere. Simple analytical and numerical models are used to: * investigate glaciers sensitivity to climate change * estimate response times * make an interpretation of historical glacier records * assess the contribution of glacier melt to sea-level rise Modern developments in glacier research, including satellite measurements are discussed in detail, making this a valuable reference source."
climate change,"Climate scientists note that the effects of climate change vary regionally. Citizen willingness to absorb the costs of adaptation and mitigation policies may correspond with these place-specific effects. Geographic information systems (GIS) analytic techniques are used to map and measure survey respondents' climate change risk at various levels of spatial resolution and precision. Spatial data are used to analyze multiple measures of climate change vulnerability along with demographic, attitudinal, and perception-based variables derived from a representative national survey of U.S. residents to predict variation in support for interventionist climate change policies. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression results show that objective risk measures explain a modest amount of variation in our dependent variable. The effect of risk perception on climate policy support is far more robust. Of all variables examined, the extent to which citizens regard climate change as threatening to their material well-being drives support for costly climate change policies."
climate change,"Even if atmospheric composition were fixed today, global-mean temperature and sea level rise would continue due to oceanic thermal inertia. These constant-composition (CC) commitments and their uncertainties are quantified. Constant-emissions (CE) commitments are also considered. The CC warming commitment could exceed 1°C. The CE warming commitment is 2° to 6°C by the year 2400. For sea level rise, the CC commitment is 10 centimeters per century (extreme range approximately 1 to 30 centimeters per century) and the CE commitment is 25 centimeters per century (7 to 50 centimeters per century). Avoiding these changes requires, eventually, a reduction in emissions to substantially below present levels. For sea level rise, a substantial long-term commitment may be impossible to avoid."
climate change,"Numerous factors are associated with poverty and underdevelopment in Africa, including climate variability. Rainfall, and climate more generally, are implicated directly in the United Nations ""Millennium Development Goals"" to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and reduce child mortality and incidence of diseases such as malaria by the target date of 2015. But, Africa is not currently on target to meet these goals. We pose a number of questions from a climate science perspective aimed at understanding this background: Is there a common origin to factors that currently constrain climate science? Why is it that in a continent where human activity is so closely linked to interannual rainfall variability has climate science received little of the benefit that saw commercialization driving meteorology in the developed world? What might be suggested as an effective way for the continent to approach future climate variability and change? We make the case that a route to addressing the challenges of climate change in Africa rests with the improved management of climate variability. We start by discussing the constraints on climate science and how they might be overcome. We explain why the optimal management of activities directly influenced by interannual climate variability (which include the development of scientific capacity) has the potential to serve as a forerunner to engagement in the wider issue of climate change. We show this both from the perspective of the climate system and the institutions that engage with climate issues. We end with a thought experiment that tests the benefits of linking climate variability and climate change in the setting of smallholder farmers in Limpopo Province, South Africa"
climate change,"Human emissions of greenhouse gases are already changing our climate. This paper provides an overview of the relation between climate change and weather extremes, and examines three specific cases where recent acute events have stimulated debate on the potential role of climate change: the European heatwave of 2003; the risk of inland flooding, such as recently in Central Europe and Great Britain; and the harsh Atlantic hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005. Furthermore, it briefly assesses the relation between climate change and El Niño, and the potential of abrupt climate change. Several trends in weather extremes are sufficiently clear to inform risk reduction efforts. In many instances, however, the potential increases in extreme events due to climate change come on top of alarming rises in vulnerability. Hence, the additional risks due to climate change should not be analysed or treated in isolation, but instead integrated into broader efforts to reduce the risk of natural disasters."
climate change,"Climate change scenario simulations with the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3), a global coupled climate model, show that if concentrations of all greenhouse gases (GHGs) could have been stabilized at the year 2000, the climate system would already be committed to 0.4°C more warming by the end of the twenty-first century. Committed sea level rise by 2100 is about an order of magnitude more, percentage-wise, compared to sea level rise simulated in the twentieth century. This increase in the model is produced only by thermal expansion of seawater, and does not take into account melt from ice sheets and glaciers, which could at least double that number. Several tenths of a degree of additional warming occurs in the model for the next 200 yr in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) B1 and A1B scenarios after stabilization in the year 2100, but with twice as much sea level rise after 100 yr, and doubling yet again in the next 100 yr to 2300. At the end of the twenty-first century, the warming in the tropical Pacific for the A2, A1B, and B1 scenarios resembles an El Nino–like response, likely due to cloud feedbacks in the model as shown in an earlier version. Greatest warming occurs at high northern latitudes and over continents. The monsoon regimes intensify somewhat in the future warmer climate, with decreases of sea level pressure at high latitudes and increases in the subtropics and parts of the midlatitudes. There is a weak summer midlatitude soil moisture drying in this model as documented in previous models. Sea ice distributions in both hemispheres are somewhat overextensive, but with about the right ice thickness at the end of the twentieth century. Future decreases in sea ice with global warming are proportional to the temperature response from the forcing scenarios, with the high forcing scenario, A2, producing an ice-free Arctic in summer by the year 2100."
climate change,"[1] A Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI), is developed based on regional mean precipitation change, mean surface air temperature change, and change in precipitation and temperature interannual variability. The RCCI is a comparative index designed to identify the most responsive regions to climate change, or Hot-Spots. The RCCI is calculated for 26 land regions from the latest set of climate change projections by 20 global climate models for the A1B, A2 and B1 IPCC emission scenarios. The Mediterranean and North Eastern European regions emerge as the primary Hot-Spots, followed by high latitude northern hemisphere regions and by Central America, the most prominent tropical Hot-Spot. The main African Hot-Spots are Southern Equatorial Africa and the Sahara. Eastern North America is the prominent Hot-Spot over the continental U.S. Different factors over different regions contribute to the magnitude of the RCCI, which is in fact greater than 0 for all regions.

climate change,This extensive report entitled “Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change” is the most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment available for scientific understanding of human influences on the past present and future climate. Its aim is to provide objective information on which to base global climate change that will ultimately meet the aim of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The report includes an overview of the factors governing climate and climate change and quantification of the sources of globally important greenhouse gases and other pollutants arising from human activities. A review of the chemical and biological processes governing their removal from the atmosphere is presented. Also included is an assessment of recent trends in climate during the industrial era which has witnessed the ever-growing impact of human activities on the global environment. The strengths and weaknesses of various climate mathematical models used by researchers for understanding the past and present climate and for calculating possible future climates are assessed. Furthermore the report discusses research aimed at the detection of human influence on the climate of the last century and presents future change projections in global climate and sea level based on a range of scenarios of future emissions of pollutants due to human activity. Finally a list of research and observational priorities needed to improve scientific understanding in key areas is presented.
climate change,"This guide sets out the main facts and uncertainties regarding climate change, and helps provide Australians with policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive, advice and source material. It is largely based on, and consistent with, the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC TAR) published in 2001. However, this guide has been substantially updated with relevant summaries of the latest international and Australian observations, scientific developments, and studies regarding the impacts of, and adaptation to climate change in Australia. 
 
While much progress in understanding the climate change issue has been made, uncertainties continue to exist about aspects of the climate change science, and regarding societal developments that will affect the extent of future climate change and societal vulnerability. Some impacts of climate change are now inevitable. However, more certainty and understanding is needed to guide decision-makers towards the most effective and cost-efficient means to adapt to climate changes in the near-term (next decade), and to avoid unacceptably large climate changes in the longer term (multi-decades to centuries) through emissions reductions measures. 
 
The high probability of at least some global warming, given the inertia in the climate and socioeconomic systems, means that some adaptation will be necessary. This will be most efficient if the location- and activity-specific nature of the likely impacts is taken into account. Considerable uncertainties about location-specific impacts can be further reduced by targeted research, while caseby- case assessments of adaptation strategies will be needed for many particular sectors and locations. 
 
Any emission reductions will progressively reduce the likelihood of impacts at the high end of the existing large range of emissions scenarios, and thus help to avoid the potentially most damaging climate change possibilities. Thus, in order to establish minimum objectives for emissions reductions, attention needs to be given to the more extreme possibilities to which adaptation may not be possible. These will determine critical greenhouse gas concentration thresholds that must be avoided if the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to be achieved. Increased research is needed to quantify the probability and global and local consequences of these high impact scenarios."

climate change,"Two different UK limestone grasslands were exposed to simulated climate change with the use of nonintrusive techniques to manipulate local climate over 5 years. Resistance to climate change, defined as the ability of a community to maintain its composition and biomass in response to environmental stress, could be explained by reference to the functional composition and successional status of the grasslands. The more fertile, early-successional grassland was much more responsive to climate change. Resistance could not be explained by the particular climates experienced by the two grasslands. Productive, disturbed landscapes created by modern human activity may prove more vulnerable to climate change than older, traditional landscapes."

Shifts in the distribution and behaviour of insect and bird species indicate that biological systems are already responding to this change. It is well established that climate is an important determinant of the spatial and temporal distribution of vectors and pathogens. In theory, a change in climate would be expected to cause changes in the geographical range, seasonality (intra-annual variability), and in the incidence rate (with or without changes in geographical or seasonal patterns). The detection and then attribution of such changes to climate change is an emerging task for scientists. We discuss the evidence required to attribute changes in disease and vectors to the early effects of anthropogenic climate change. The literature to date indicates that there is a lack of strong evidence of the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases (i.e. malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis, tick-borne diseases). New approaches to monitoring, such as frequent and long-term sampling along transects to monitor the full latitudinal and altitudinal range of specific vector species, are necessary in order to provide convincing direct evidence of climate change effects. There is a need to reassess the appropriate levels of evidence, including dealing with the uncertainties attached to detecting the health impacts of global change."
climate change,"Extreme climate events such as aridity, drought, flood, cyclone and stormy rainfall are expected to leave an impact on human society. They are also expected to generate widespread response to adapt and mitigate the sufferings associated with these extremes. Societal and cultural responses to prolonged drought include population dislocation, cultural separation, habitation abandonment, and societal collapse. A typical response to local aridity is the human migration to safer and productive areas. However, climate and culture can interact in numerous ways. We hypothesize that people may resort to modify dwelling environments by adapting new strategies to optimize the utility of available water by harvesting rain rather than migrating to newer areas. We review recent palaeoclimatological evidence for climate change during the Holocene, and match those data with archaeological and historical records to test our 'climate change-rainwater harvest' hypothesis. We find correlation between heightened historical human efforts for construction of rainwater harvesting structures across regions in response to abrupt climate fluctuations, like aridity and drought. Historical societal adaptations to climate fluctuations may provide insights on potential responses of modern societies to future climate change that has a bearing on water resources, food production and management of natural systems."
climate change,"Until the 1990s, the dominant view of climate change was that Earth’s climate system has changed gradually in response to both natural and human-induced processes. Evidence pieced together over the last few decades, however, shows that climate has changed much more rapidly—sometimes abruptly— in the past and therefore could do so again in the future. Abrupt climate change generally refers to a large shift in climate that persists for years or longer—such as marked changes in average temperature, or altered patterns of storms, floods, or droughts—over a widespread area such as an entire country or continent, that takes place so rapidly and unexpectedly that human or natural systems have difficulty adapting to it. In the context of past abrupt climate change, “rapidly” typically refers to about a decade or longer. It is important not to be fatalistic about the threats posed by abrupt climate change. Societies have faced both gradual and abrupt climate change for thousands of years and have learned to adapt through various mechanisms, such as moving indoors, developing irrigation for crops, and migrating away from inhospitable regions. Nevertheless, because climate change will likely continue in the coming decades, denying the likelihood or downplaying the relevance of past abrupt events could be costly. Increased knowledge is the best way to improve the effectiveness of response; research into the causes, patterns, and likelihood of abrupt climate change can help reduce vulnerabilites and increase our ability to adapt."
climate change,"Large, abrupt, and widespread climate changes with major impacts have occurred repeatedly in the past, when the Earth system was forced across thresholds. Although abrupt climate changes can occur for many reasons, it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large, abrupt events. Were such an event to recur, the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious. Unpredictability exhibited near climate thresholds in simple models shows that some uncertainty will always be associated with projections. In light of these uncertainties, policy-makers should consider expanding research into abrupt climate change, improving monitoring systems, and taking actions designed to enhance the adaptability and resilience of ecosystems and economies."
climate change,"The magnitude of climate changes forecast for the next century is comparable to the magnitude of warming during the last deglaciation. No climate change of similar magnitude has occurred since that event. The palaeoecological evidence of the response, especially of plants, to past climate change indicates that evolutionary adaptation has played no more than a minor role and that migration is the usual response of organisms to climate change. The individualism of response has important implications with respect to changes in the nature of vegetation and ecosystems (...)"
climate change,"A comprehensive statistical analysis of how an index of the Southern Oscillation changed from 1882 to 1995 was given by Trenberth and Hoar [1996], with a focus on the unusual nature of the 1990–1995 El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm event in the context of an observed trend for more El Niño and fewer La Niña events after the late 1970s. The conclusions of that study have been challenged by two studies which deal with only the part of our results pertaining to the length of runs of anomalies of one sign in the Southern Oscillation Index. They therefore neglect the essence of Trenberth and Hoar, which focussed on the magnitude of anomalies for certain periods and showed that anomalies during both the post‐1976 and 1990‐mid‐1995 periods were highly unlikely given the previous record. With updated data through mid 1997, we have performed additional tests using a regression model with autoregressive‐moving average (ARMA) errors that simultaneously estimates the appropriate ARMA model to fit the data and assesses the statistical significance of how unusual the two periods of interest are. The mean SOI for the post‐1976 period is statistically different from the overall mean at <0.05% and so is the 1990‐mid‐1995 period. The recent evolution of ENSO, with a major new El Niño event underway in 1997, reinforces the evidence that the tendency for more El Niño and fewer La Niña events since the late 1970s is highly unusual and very unlikely to be accounted for solely by natural variability."
climate change,"Abstract An optimal linear filter (fingerprint) is derived for the detection of a given time-dependent, multivariate climate change signal in the presence of natural climate variability noise. Application of the fingerprint to the observed (or model simulated) climate data yields a climate change detection variable (detector) with maximal signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal fingerprint is given by the product of the assumed signal pattern and the inverse of the climate variability covariance matrix. The data can consist of any, not necessarily dynamically complete, climate dataset for which estimates of the natural variability covariance matrix exist. The single-pattern analysis readily generalizes to the multipattern case of a climate change signal lying in a prescribed (in practice relatively low dimensional) signal pattern space: the single-pattern result is simply applied separately to each individual base pattern spanning the signal pattern space. Multipattern detection methods can be applied either t..."
climate change,"Abstract: Climate changes may be influencing the breeding patterns of certain organisms. Effects on breeding activities could eventually lead to significant changes in population structure that may be reflected in population declines of species that are especially sensitive, such as some amphibians. Thus, climate changes may have affected the timing of breeding in some European amphibian species. To further test whether amphibian reproductive cycles in temperate countries are responding to climate changes, we conducted an analysis of the breeding phenology of four species of North American anurans for which we have long‐term data sets. Populations of at least two of these species have been declining, and it has been suggested that they and other amphibians may be especially sensitive to climate change. Our results suggest that climate change has not influenced the timing of breeding in amphibians in North America. At one site, in Oregon, a trend (nonsignificant) for western toads (  Bufo boreas) to breed increasingly early was associated with increasing temperature. At four other sites, however, neither western toads nor Cascades frogs (   Rana cascadae) showed statistically significant positive trends toward earlier breeding. At three of four of these sites, breeding time was associated with warmer temperatures. The spring peeper (   Pseudacris crucifer) in Michigan did not show a statistically significant trend toward breeding earlier but did show a significant positive relationship between breeding time and temperature. Fowler's toad (   Bufo fowleri) in eastern Canada did not show a trend toward breeding earlier, and there was no positive relationship between breeding time and temperature. It did however, show a strong but statistically insignificant trend toward breeding later. The broad pattern emerging from available studies is that some temperate‐zone anuran populations show a trend toward breeding earlier, whereas others do not. It is important to track the breeding patterns of amphibians with long‐term data sets to more fully understand how we can manage threatened populations."
climate change,"393 M ounting evidence suggests that the earth is experiencing a period of rapid climate change. Never before has it been so important to understand how environmental change influences the earth’s biota and to distinguish anthropogenic change from natural variability. Long-term studies in the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region provide the opportunity to observe how changes in the physical environment are related to changes in the marine ecosystem. Analyses of paleoc limate records (MosleyThompson 1992, Peel 1992, Domack et al. 1993, Thompson et al. 1994, Dai et al. 1995, Domack and McClennen 1996, Leventer et al. 1996) have shown that the WAP region has moved from a relatively cold regime between approximately 2700 BP and 100 BP, to a relatively warm regime during the current century. Air temperature records from the last half-century show a dramatic warming trend, confirming the rapidity of change in the WAP area (Sansom 1989, Stark 1994, Rott et al. 1996, Smith et al. 1996). Significantly, polar ecosystem research over the last few decades (Fraser et al. 1992, Trivelpiece and Fraser 1996) and paleoecological records for the past 500 years (Emslie 1995, Emslie et al. 1998) reveal ecological transitions that have occurred in response to this climate change. In this article, we summarize the available data on climate variability and trends in the WAP region and discuss these data in the context of long-term climate variability during the last 8000 years of the Holocene. We then compare the available data on ecosystem change in the WAP region to the data on climate variability. Both historical and paleoenvironmental records indicate a climate gradient along the WAP that includes a dry, cold continental regime to the south and a wet, warm maritime regime to the north. The position of this climate gradient has shifted over time in response to the dominant climate regime, and it makes the WAP region a highly sensitive location for assessing ecological responses to climate variability. Our findings show that this century’s rapid climate warming has occurred concurrently with a shift in the population size and distribution of penguin species."
climate change,"Climate change belongs in a new category of global environmental health problems. It is not just that the impacts are widely distributed: climate change is a result of unbalanced global systems. It is one of the modern threats to a ‘safe operating space’ for the planet. The effects on health occur directly, such as increased heat waves; through pressures on natural systems (reduced crop yields and undernutrition, for instance); and, as a consequence of social disruption. Also there may be impacts due to policy responses to climate change: these are so-called ‘transition risks’. Improving baseline health status is fundamental to coping with climate change, because the populations that are most seriously affected are those that already bear a heavy burden of disease. But an undifferentiated public health response is not sufficient. There are distinctive features of climate change that have to be taken into account. Mitigation, or primary prevention, will require rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse emissions if global heating is to be limited. The goal is to identify common solutions, responses to climate change that are health-enhancing rather than health damaging. There are many candidates, but by and large they are not on the path of ‘business as usual’ development."
climate change,"Abstract Climate change does not yet feature prominently within the environmental or economic policy agendas of developing countries. Yet evidence shows that some of the most adverse effects of climate change will be in developing countries, where populations are most vulnerable and least likely to easily adapt to climate change, and that climate change will affect the potential for development in these countries. Some synergies already exist between climate change policies and the sustainable development agenda in developing countries, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and sustainable land-use policies. Despite limited attention from policy-makers to date, climate change policies could have significant ancillary benefits for the local environment. The reverse is also true as local and national policies to address congestion, air quality, access to energy services and energy diversity may also limit GHG emissions. Nevertheless there could be significant trade-offs associated with deeper levels of mitigation in some countries, for example where developing countries are dependent on indigenous coal and may be required to switch to cleaner yet more expensive fuels to limit emissions. The distributional impacts of such policies are an important determinant of their feasibility and need to be considered up-front. It follows that future agreements on mitigation and adaptation under the convention will need to recognise the diverse situations of developing countries with respect to their level of economic development, their vulnerability to climate change and their ability to adapt or mitigate. Recognition of how climate change is likely to influence other development priorities may be a first step toward building cost-effective strategies and integrated, institutional capacity in developing countries to respond to climate change. Opportunities may also exist in developing countries to use regional economic organisations to assist in the design of integrated responses and to exploit synergies between climate change and other policies such as those designed to combat desertification and preserve biodiversity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

climate change,"A methodology is presented for generating surrogate climate-change scenarios with a regional climate model. The procedure is simple to implement and dynamically consistent. It entails (i) adopting a realized or simulated atmospheric flow evolution and (ii) prescribing specific thermodynamic modifications of this realization to a regional model's initial fields and externally-specified time-dependent lateral boundaries fields. The resulting scenarios can be used for process and parameterization studies, to calibrate the regional response to a putative global climate change, and to intercompare different models. The approach is illustrated with two month-long regional climate model simulations. The experiment is designed to explore the response within Europe to a pseudo-global warming of 2 K with an accompanying increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Analysis reveals that there is a spatially-differentiated preciptation increase consonant with the domain-averaged increase of about 16% in the water vapor content."
climate change,"Climate change resulting from the enhanced greenhouse effect is expected to give rise to changes in hydrological systems. This hydrological change, as with the change in climate variables, will vary regionally around the globe. Impact studies at local and regional scales are needed to assess how different regions will be affected. This study focuses on assessment of hydrological impacts of climate change over a wide range of Swedish basins. Different methods of transferring the signal of climate change from climate models to hydrological models were used. Several hydrological model simulations using regional climate model scenarios from Swedish Regional Climate Modelling Programme (SWECLIM) are presented. A principal conclusion is that subregional impacts to river flow vary considerably according to whether a basin is in northern or southern Sweden. Furthermore, projected hydrological change is just as dependent on the choice of the global climate model used for regional climate model boundary conditions as the choice of anthropogenic emissions scenario."
climate change,"In 1990 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) completed its report on the greenhouse effect. The IPCC had been set up under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organisation and the United Nations Environment Programme, to examine how climate and sea level might change, what might be the impact of these changes and what could be the most appropriate response to them. IPCC Working Groups tackled each of these three tasks. Working Group II (Impacts) concluded that greenhouse gas-induced changes of climate would have an important effect on agriculture, with the most severe negative impacts probably occurring in regions of high present-day vulnerability that are least able to adjust technologically to such effects. 1 The purpose of this book is to consider, in more detail than could be covered within the confines of the IPCC report on agriculture, the reasoning behind this conclusion, its implications for global food security and the most appropriate courses of action."
climate change,"Africa is one of the regions of the world potentially most vulnerable to climate change. Warming of the globe due to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases appears to be inevitable. Therefore, it is imperative that policy makers in regions such as Africa begin to consider what measures they should take to adapt to the potential conseqences of climate change. A number of adaptation policies are suggested here. The policies address general adaptation measures as well as specific measures in water resources, coastal resources (adapting to sea-level nse), forests, ecosystems, and agriculture. These measures would enhance the flexibhty of resources to adapt to climate change and would have net benefits greater than costs. In some cases, the measures make sense without considering climate change because they help address current climate variability. In other cases, the measures must be implemented in anticipation of climate change because they would be ineffective if implemented as a reaction to climate change."
climate change,"The presence of radiatively active gases in the Earth's atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone) raises its global mean surface temperature by 30 K, making our planet habitable by life as we know it. There has been an increase in carbon dioxide and other trace gases since the Industrial Revolution, largely as a result of man's activities, increasing the radiative heating of the troposphere and surface by about 2 W m -2. This heating is likely to be enhanced by resulting changes in water vapor, snow and sea ice, and cloud. The associated equilibrium temperature rise is estimated to be between 1 and 2 K, there being uncertainties in the strength of climate feedbacks, particularly those due to cloud. The large thermal inertia of the oceans will slow the rate of warming, so that the expected temperature rise will be smaller than the equilibrium rise. This increases the uncertainty in the expected warming to date, with estimates ranging from less than 0.5 K to over 1 K. The observed increase of 0.5 K since 1900 is consistent with the lower range of these estimates, but the variability in the observed record is such that one cannot necessarily conclude that the observed temperature change is due to increases in trace gases. The prediction of changes in temperature over the next 50 years depends on assumptions concerning future changes in trace gas concentrations, the sensitivity of climate, and the effective thermal inertia of the oceans. On the basis of our current understanding a further warming of at least 1 K seems likely. Numerical models of climate indicate that the changes will not be uniform, nor will they be confined to temperature. The simulated warming is largest in high latitudes in winter and smallest over sea ice in summer, with little seasonal variation in the tropics. Annual mean precipitation and runoff increase in high latitudes, and most simulations indicate a drier land surface in northern mid-latitudes in summer. The agreement between different models is much better for temperature than for changes in the hydrological cycle. Priorities for future research include developing an improved representation of cloud in numerical models, obtaining a better understanding of vertical mixing in the deep ocean, and determining the inherent variability of the ocean-atmosphere system. Progress in these areas should enable detection of a man-made ""greenhouse"" warming within the next two decades."
climate change,"Having risen from relative obscurity as few as ten years ago, climate change now looms large among environmental policy issues. Its scope is global; the potential environmental and economic impacts are ubiquitous; the potential restrictions on human choices touch the most basic goals of people in all nations; and the sheer scope of the potential response—a significant shift away from using fossil fuels as the primary energy source in the modern economy—is daunting. In this paper, we explore the economics of climate change policy. We examine the risks that climate change poses for society, the benefits of protection against the effects of climate change, and the costs of alternative protection policies. We organize our discussion around three broad themes: why costs and benefits matter in assessing climate change policies, as does the uncertainty surrounding them; why well-designed, cost-effective climate policies are essential in addressing the threat of climate change; and why a coherent architecture of international agreements is key to successful policy implementation. We conclude the paper with a summary of key policy lessons and gaps in knowledge."
climate change,"Climate models predict that increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will change our climate. However, the range of observations available to assess these model predictions is limited. We have utilized an ocean biogeochemical model to project the impact of climate change on the oxygen cycle in the ocean and the air‐sea exchange of oxygen. With climate change, our model predicts an outgassing of oxygen from the ocean. In the model, the Southern Ocean is the region that displays the largest change in the air‐sea exchange of oxygen with climate change. The reduced oxygen uptake in the Southern Ocean is dominated by a reduction in convective mixing and in the subduction rate of bottom water which decreases the amount of dissolved oxygen in the Southern Ocean. Our model results suggest that dissolved oxygen is sensitive to changes in Southern Ocean circulation revealing the potential to use dissolved oxygen to test model predictions of climate change. From Southern Ocean observations collected 28 years a part we observed a decrease in dissolved oxygen that was consistent with model climate change simulation. This provides credibility to the climate model predictions. Additional analysis and observations of dissolved oxygen are needed to substantiate our climate model simulations."

climate change,"Post-industrial global warming is not the Earth's first major climate-change event. If we are to appreciate the significance and relevance to biology of current climate change, it is important to be aware of past climate events, at least the significant ones. This chapter summarises some of the major episodes between the Earth's formation and the beginning of the current, Quaternary, ice age. Early biology and climate of the Hadean and Archeaen eons (4.6–2.5 billion years ago, bya) The pre-biotic Earth (4.6–3.8 bya) The Earth and the solar system formed some 4.6 bya, give or take a few hundred million years. It formed with the solar (Sol) system accreting out of a dust and gas cloud. The dust, ice (composed of various volatiles compounds and not just water) and rocks were not all small and particulate but themselves had accreted into small and large asteroid-sized bodies that ranged in size up to, and including, small planets. One of these, a Mars-sized planetoid (Thea) is thought to have had a glancing blow with the proto-Earth, exchanged material, and formed the Moon (Luna). This is not irrelevant to the nature of the Earth's climate. The lunar/Earth ratio of mass of 1:18.3 is much greater than any satellite/planet mass ratio for any other planet in Sol's system. Taking the Copernican principle, that there is nothing cosmologically special about the Earth as a life-bearing planet, this begs the question as to whether our large moon is a necessary factor facilitating a biosphere, or at least a biosphere with longevity."
climate change,"Ecologically relevant measures of contemporary global climate change can predict species distributions and vulnerabilities. Climate change challenges organisms to adapt or move to track changes in environments in space and time. We used two measures of thermal shifts from analyses of global temperatures over the past 50 years to describe the pace of climate change that species should track: the velocity of climate change (geographic shifts of isotherms over time) and the shift in seasonal timing of temperatures. Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes, despite slower ocean warming. These indices give a complex mosaic of predicted range shifts and phenology changes that deviate from simple poleward migration and earlier springs or later falls. They also emphasize potential conservation concerns, because areas of high marine biodiversity often have greater velocities of climate change and seasonal shifts."
climate change,"How anthropogenic climate change will affect hydroclimate in the arid regions of southwestern North America has implications for the allocation of water resources and the course of regional development. Here we show that there is a broad consensus among climate models that this region will dry in the 21st century and that the transition to a more arid climate should already be under way. If these models are correct, the levels of aridity of the recent multiyear drought or the Dust Bowl and the 1950s droughts will become the new climatology of the American Southwest within a time frame of years to decades."

climate change,"We examine the sensitivity of a climate model to a wide range of radiative forcings, including changes of solar irradiance, atmospheric CO2, O3, CFCs, clouds, aerosols, surface albedo, and a “ghost” forcing introduced at arbitrary heights, latitudes, longitudes, seasons, and times of day. We show that, in general, the climate response, specifically the global mean temperature change, is sensitive to the altitude, latitude, and nature of the forcing; that is, the response to a given forcing can vary by 50% or more depending upon characteristics of the forcing other than its magnitude measured in watts per square meter. The consistency of the response among different forcings is higher, within 20% or better, for most of the globally distributed forcings suspected of influencing global mean temperature in the past century, but exceptions occur for certain changes of ozone or absorbing aerosols, for which the climate response is less well behaved. In all cases the physical basis for the variations of the response can be understood. The principal mechanisms involve alterations of lapse rate and decrease (increase) of large-scale cloud cover in layers that are preferentially heated (cooled). Although the magnitude of these effects must be model-dependent, the existence and sense of the mechanisms appear to be reasonable. Overall, we reaffirm the value of the radiative forcing concept for predicting climate response and for comparative studies of different forcings; indeed, the present results can help improve the accuracy of such analyses and define error estimates. Our results also emphasize the need for measurements having the specificity and precision needed to define poorly known forcings such as absorbing aerosols and ozone change. Available data on aerosol single scatter albedo imply that anthropogenic aerosols cause less cooling than has commonly been assumed. However, negative forcing due to the net ozone change since 1979 appears to have counterbalanced 30–50% of the positive forcing due to the increase of well-mixed greenhouse gases in the same period. As the net ozone change includes halogen-driven ozone depletion with negative radiative forcing and a tropospheric ozone increase with positive radiative forcing, it is possible that the halogen-driven ozone depletion has counterbalanced more than half of the radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases since 1979."
flat earth,"Flat slab subduction is an enigmatic style of subduction where the slab attains a horizontal orientation for up to several hundred kilometers below the base of the overriding plate. It has been linked to the subduction of buoyant aseismic ridges or plateaus, but the spatial correlation is problematic, as there are subducting aseismic ridges and plateaus that do not produce a flat slab, most notably in the Western Pacific, and there are flat slabs without an aseismic ridge or plateau. In this paper an alternative hypothesis is investigated which poses that flat slab subduction is associated with subduction zones that are both old (active for a long time) and wide (large trench-parallel extent). A global subduction zone compilation is presented showing that flat slabs preferentially occur at old (>∼80–100 Myr) and wide (≥∼6000 km) subduction zones. This is explained by the tendency for wide subduction zones to decrease their dip angle in the uppermost mantle with progressive time, especially in the center. A set of numerical subduction models confirms this behavior, showing that only the central parts of wide slabs progressively reduce their slab dip, such that slab flattening, and ultimately flat slab subduction, can occur. The models further show that a progressive decrease in slab dip angle for wide slabs leads to increased vertical deviatoric tensional stresses at the top surface of the slab (mantle wedge suction), facilitating flat slab subduction, while narrow slabs retain steep dip angles and low vertical deviatoric tensional stresses. The results provide a potential explanation why present-day flat slabs only occur in the Eastern Pacific, as only here subduction zones were old and wide enough to initiate flat slab subduction, and why Laramide flat slab subduction and South China flat slab subduction were possible in the geological past."

flat earth,"ABSTRACT The Flat Earth movement appears to have emerged from a combination of Biblical literalism (e.g., young Earth creationism, geocentrism) and conspiracy theorizing (e.g., belief that NASA faked the moon landings). Interviews with participants of the first International Flat Earth Conference in 2017 revealed that the majority of Flat Earthers have come to endorse Flat Earth ideas only within the last few years after watching videos on YouTube. However, the novelty of the movement means that there is a lack of literature on this group, including what exactly convinced these new Flat Earthers and how that conversion took place. Here, we provide evidence for a gradual process of conversion after multiple exposures to Flat Earth YouTube videos to which viewers were initially skeptical but report failing to adequately debunk. Furthermore, evidence is presented here regarding the crucial role YouTube played in their conversion process, suggesting the platform is potentially a strong avenue for changing beliefs. The narratives provided here also support much of the research on conversion, describing a gradual process of deep personal change, via the relatively new mechanism of social media, where one finds a new center of concern, interest, and behavior, as well as a different view of reality."
flat earth,"In this article, we focus on the problem of minimization of the fuel consumption for the coplanar orbit transfer problem. This problem is usually solved numerically by a shooting method, based on the application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle; however, the shooting method is known to be hard to initialize, and the convergence is difficult to obtain because of discontinuities of the optimal control. Several methods are known in order to overcome that problem; however, in this article, we introduce a new approach based on the following preliminary remark. When considering a 2D flat Earth model with constant gravity, the optimal control problem of passing from an initial configuration to some final configuration by minimizing the fuel consumption can be very efficiently solved, and the solution leads to a very efficient algorithm. Based on that, we propose a continuous deformation from this flat Earth model to a modified flat Earth model that is diffeomorphic to the usual round Earth model. The resulting numerical continuation process thus provides a new way to solve the problem of minimization of the fuel consumption for the coplanar orbit transfer problem.

flat earth,"Capitalizing on the observational advantage offered by its tiny M dwarf host, we present Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) grism measurements of the transmission spectrum of the super-Earth exoplanet GJ1214b. These are the first published WFC3 observations of a transiting exoplanet atmosphere. After correcting for a ramp-like instrumental systematic, we achieve nearly photon-limited precision in these observations, finding the transmission spectrum of GJ1214b to be flat between 1.1 and 1.7 μm. Inconsistent with a cloud-free solar composition atmosphere at 8.2σ, the measured achromatic transit depth most likely implies a large mean molecular weight for GJ1214b's outer envelope. A dense atmosphere rules out bulk compositions for GJ1214b that explain its large radius by the presence of a very low density gas layer surrounding the planet. High-altitude clouds can alternatively explain the flat transmission spectrum, but they would need to be optically thick up to 10 mbar or consist of particles with a range of sizes approaching 1 μm in diameter."

flat earth,"The development of ultrathin flat lenses has revolutionized the lens technologies and holds great promise for miniaturizing the conventional lens system in integrated photonic applications. In certain applications, the lenses are required to operate in harsh and/or extreme environments, for example aerospace, chemical, and biological environments. Under such circumstances, it is critical that the ultrathin flat lenses can be resilient and preserve their outstanding performance. However, the majority of the demonstrated ultrathin flat lenses are based on metal or semiconductor materials that have poor chemical, thermal, and UV stability, which limit their applications. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene ultrathin flat lens that can be applied in harsh environments for different applications, including a low Earth orbit space environment, strong corrosive chemical environments (pH = 0 and pH = 14), and biochemical environment. The graphene lenses have extraordinary environmental stability and can maintain a high level of structural integrity and outstanding focusing performance under different test conditions. Thus, it opens tremendous practical application opportunities for ultrathin flat lenses."
flat earth,"Subduction of the Paleo‐Pacific Plate caused widespread Mesozoic magmatism, lithospheric deformation and thinning, and mineralization along the continental margin of East Asia. However, the details of this subduction process remain unclear. To investigate the regional geodynamic evolution and subduction processes of the Paleo‐Pacific Plate, we carried out a geochronological, geochemical, and Sr‐Nd‐Hf isotopic study of Middle‐Late Jurassic adakitic lavas in the Hailar Basin, northeast (NE) China. These rocks have relatively high Sr contents (434–877 ppm), low heavy rare earth element and Y (6.81–14.37 ppm) contents, and high Sr/Y ratios (56–83), which are characteristic of adakites. The rocks are classified into Middle Jurassic high‐K and Late Jurassic low‐K adakitic lavas. The high‐K adakitic lavas were derived by dehydration melting of thickened garnet‐bearing amphibolite‐facies lower crust. In contrast, the low‐K adakitic lavas could be considered as pristine slab‐melts that were likely generated by hydrous melting of subducted eclogitic oceanic crust, followed by limited interaction between the slab melt and peridotite as a consequence of flat‐slab subduction. Combined with previous data, our results demonstrate that the late Mesozoic magmatism in NE China records the entire temporal‐spatial evolution of subduction of the Paleo‐Pacific slab from initial shallowing of the subduction angle to flat‐slab subduction, followed by basalt‐eclogite phase transformation and finally slab rollback."
flat earth,"The purpose of this study is to explore primary school children’s understandings about the shape of the Earth. The sample is consisted of 124 first-graders from five primary schools located in an urban city of Turkey. The data of the study were collected through children’s drawings and semi-structured interviews. Results obtained from the drawings showed that only one third of the participants have drawn scientifically acceptable images of the earth. However, the subsequent semi-structured interviews revealed that more children have scientific knowledge about the shape of the Earth. The results also revealed that cartoons, story books and daily life experiences are the reasons for children’s misconceptions."
flat earth,"The Starlink satellites are shaped like flat panels. The flat sides face zenith and nadir during normal operations. Their brightness is determined by the product of the solar illumination on the downward facing side of the panel multiplied by the area of that side projected toward the observer on Earth. This geometry leads to a unique brightness function that is not shared by other satellites. For example, the observed brightness is very sensitive to the solar elevation angle. There are circumstances where sunlight only illuminates the upward facing side of the satellite rendering it invisible to Earth-based observers. A brightness model depending on the solar aspect and the observer aspect of the flat panel, in addition to the satellite distance, is described. Absolute brightness is the only free parameter of the model, and it is taken to be that at a distance of 1,000 km when the solar and observer factors are unity. This model has been successfully fitted to a set of observed magnitudes. The absolute visual magnitude of a Starlink satellite as determined from this fitting is 4.1 +/- 0.1. The model could be used to determine the absolute magnitude of the Starlink satellite known as Dark Sat which has a special low-albedo coating."
flat earth,"Accurate and up-to-date tidal flat mapping is of much importance to learning how coastal ecosystems work in a time of anthropogenic disturbances and rising sea levels, which will provide scientific instruction for sustainable management and ecological assessments. For large-scale and high spatial-resolution mapping of tidal flats, it is difficult to obtain accurate tidal flat maps without multi-temporal observation data. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential and advantages of the freely accessible Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery archive and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for accurate tidal flats mapping. A novel approach was proposed, including multi-temporal feature extraction, machine learning classification using GEE and morphological post-processing. The 50 km buffer of the coastline from Hangzhou Bay to Yalu River in China’s eastern coastal zone was taken as the study area. From the perspective of natural attributes and unexploited status of tidal flats, we delineated a broader extent comprising intertidal flats, supratidal barren flats and vegetated flats, since intertidal flats are major component of the tidal flats. The overall accuracy of the resultant map was about 94.4% from a confusion matrix for accuracy assessment. The results showed that the use of time-series images can greatly eliminate the effects of tidal level, and improve the mapping accuracy. This study also proved the potential and advantage of combining the GEE platform with time-series Landsat images, due to its powerful cloud computing platform, especially for large scale and longtime tidal flats mapping."

flat earth,"Accurate watershed delineation is a precondition for runoff and water quality simulation. Traditional digital elevation model (DEM) may not generate realistic drainage networks due to large depressions and subtle elevation differences in local-scale plains. In this study, we propose a new method for solving the problem of watershed delineation, using the Taihu Basin as a case study. Rivers, lakes, and reservoirs were obtained from Sentinel-2A images with the Canny algorithm on Google Earth Engine (GEE), rather than from DEM, to compose the drainage network. Catchments were delineated by modifying the flow direction of rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and overland flow, instead of using DEM values. A watershed was divided into the following three types: Lake, reservoir, and overland catchment. A total of 2291 river segments, seven lakes, eight reservoirs, and 2306 subwatersheds were retained in this study. Compared with results from HydroSHEDS and Arc Hydro, the proposed method retains crisscross structures in the topology and prevented erroneous streamlines in large lakes. High-resolution Sentinel-2A images available on the GEE have relatively greater merits than DEMs for precisely representing drainage networks and catchments, especially in the plains area. Because of the higher accuracy, this method can be used as a new solution for watershed division in the plains area."
flat earth,"Science has changed many of our dearly held and commonsensical (but incorrect) beliefs. For example, few still believe the world is flat, and few still believe the sun orbits the earth. Few still believe humans are unrelated to the rest of the animal kingdom, and soon few will believe human thinking is computer-like. Instead, as with all animals, our thoughts are based on bodily experiences, and our thoughts and behaviors are controlled by bodily and neural systems of perception, action, and emotion interacting with the physical and social environments. We are embodied; nothing more. Embodied cognition is about cognition formatted in sensorimotor experience, and sensorimotor systems make those thoughts dynamic. Even processes that seem abstract, such as language comprehension and goal understanding, are embodied. Thus, embodied cognition is not limited to 1 type of thought or another: It is cognition."
flat earth,"The sea surface acts as a very strong reflector because of the large impedance contrast between water and air. The reflection coefficient is [Formula: see text] in a very good approximation. Apart from the surface multiples, the sea surface is also responsible for generating the source and receiver ghost wavefields. These cause the well-known ghost notches in the spectrum: areas where the signal-to-noise ratio is very low. To model the ghost wavefields, ghost operators can be computed and applied to ghost-free data. Modeling experiments indicate that in the case of a flat sea surface, the character of the notches in various gather types, e.g., receiver gather, common-offset gather, shot record, is largely determined by the complexity of the earth. In a simple earth, e.g., horizontally layered, the notches are always well-defined and deep, but in a complex earth, they become blurry in some of the gather types. Therefore, in the case of a complex subsurface, source deghosting is best carried out in the common-receiver domain and receiver deghosting is best carried out in the common-shot domain. In the case of a simple subsurface, deghosting can be carried out in all domains. An additional factor is that the sea surface may be rough and dynamic. This causes blurry ghost notches in all gather types, even in the case of a simple earth. To model the source ghost for this situation, an effective static rough sea surface suffices. This keeps the computations simple. The condition is that the source has an impulsive character. However, to model the receiver ghost (and the source ghost for a nonimpulsive source), the dynamics of the sea surface must be included. This can be done by composing the final result from the results computed for several “frozen” snapshots of the dynamic sea surface."
flat earth,"Salar de Uyuni (SdU), with a geological history that reflects 50 000 years of climate change, is the largest hypersaline salt flat on Earth and is estimated to be the biggest lithium reservoir in the world. Its salinity reaches saturation levels for NaCl, a kosmotropic salt, and high concentrations of MgCL2 and LiCl, both salts considered important chaotrophic stressors. In addition, extreme temperatures, anoxic conditions, high UV irradiance, high albedo and extremely low concentrations of phosphorous, make SdU a unique natural extreme environment in which to contrast hypotheses about limiting factors of life diversification. Geophysical studies of brines from different sampling stations show that water activity is rather constant along SdU. Geochemical measurements show significant differences in magnesium concentration, ranging from 0.2 to 2M. This work analyses the prokaryotic diversity and community structure at four SdU sampling stations, selected according to their location and ionic composition. Prokaryotic communities were composed of both Archaea (with members of the classes Halobacteria, Thermoplasmata and Nanohaloarchaea, from the Euryarchaeota and Nanohaloarcheota phyla respectively) and Bacteria (mainly belonging to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla). The important differences in composition of microbial communities inversely correlate with Mg2+ concentration, suggesting that prokaryotic diversity at SdU is chaotropic dependent."
flat earth,"Accurate determination of active earth pressure distribution on rigid retaining wall including the magnitude and height of application of its resultant is of immense importance for designing the earth retaining structures. In this paper, an analytical solution based on the soil arching effect is presented. According to Mohr’s stress circle, a new relationship between active earth pressure and normal stress on failure surface at any depth from backfill surface is obtained. By analysing parabolic arch of minor principal stresses, a new coefficient of active lateral earth pressure is proposed. The problems that the vertical static equilibrium equation of differential flat element considering soil arching effect is not reasonable are analysed. Then, based on the limit equilibrium of differential flat element, new formulas relevant to the distribution of active earth pressure, the magnitude and height of application of its resultant are derived. The effects of backfill internal friction angle, wall–soil friction angle, wall height, surcharge load and backfill unit weight on those formulas are investigated in detail. In addition, the comparisons of the predictions by proposed equations with available test data as well as existing solutions are carried out, which implies adequate accuracy of the proposed solutions for all ratios of wall–soil friction angle to internal friction angle."
flat earth,"Using a kinetic simulation of magnetic reconnection, it was recently shown that magnetic-field-aligned electric fields (E∥) can be present over large spatial scales in reconnection exhausts. The largest values of E∥ are observed within double layers. The existence of double layers in the Earth's magnetosphere is well documented. In our simulation, their formation is triggered by large parallel streaming of electrons into the reconnection region. These parallel electron fluxes are required for maintaining quasi-neutrality of the reconnection region and increase with decreasing values of the normalized electron pressure upstream of the reconnection region, βe∞=2μ0ne∞Te∞/B∞2. A threshold (βe∞ < 0.02) is derived for strong double layers to develop. We also document how the electron confinement, provided in part by the structure in E∥, allows sustained energization by perpendicular electric fields (E⊥). The energization is a consequence of the confined electrons' chaotic orbital motion that includes drifts ali..."
flat earth,"A spectrally flat mid-infrared supercontinuum (MIR-SC) spanning 2.8–3.9 μm with a maximum output power of 411 mW was generated in a holmium-doped ZBLAN fiber amplifier (HDZFA). A broadband fiber-based SC covering the 2.4–3.2 μm region was designed to seed the amplifier. Benefiting from the broadband seed laser, the obtained SC had a high spectral flatness of 3 dB over the range of 2.93–3.70 μm (770 nm). A spectral integral showed that the SC power beyond 3 μm was 372 mW, i.e., a power ratio of 90.6% of the total power. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, not only demonstrates the first spectrally flat MIR-SC directly generated in fluoride fiber amplifiers, but also reports the highest power ratio beyond 3 μm obtained in rare-earth-doped fluoride fiber until now."
flat earth,"A fair knowledge of the atmospheric muon distributions at Earth is a prerequisite for the simulations of cosmic ray setups and rare event search detectors. A modified power law is proposed for atmospheric muon energy distribution which gives a good description of the cosmic muon data in low as well as high energy regime. Using this distribution, analytical forms for zenith angle [Formula: see text] distribution are obtained. Assuming a flat Earth, it leads to the [Formula: see text] form where it is shown that the parameter [Formula: see text] is nothing but the power of the energy distribution. Exact analytical function is obtained for inclined trajectory of muon. A new closed form for zenith angle distribution is obtained without assuming a flat Earth and which gives an improved description of the data at all angles even above [Formula: see text]. These distributions are tested with the available atmospheric muon data of energy and angular distributions. The parameters of these distributions can be used to characterize the cosmic muon data as a function of energy, angle and altitude."
flat earth,"AbstractA new simplified method is proposed to compute the active earth pressure acting on the backface of a rigid retaining wall undergoing horizontal translation. The effect of soil arching for cohesive backfill soil and friction mobilized along the wall–soil interface was considered. Analytical expressions to determine the slip surface angle and the coefficient of active earth pressure were obtained using the limit-equilibrium approach. These expressions were used for the horizontal flat-element method to obtain theoretical formulas for the active earth pressure, active thrust, and its point of application. Additionally, an implicit solution was derived for the depth of the tension crack in the backfill. A parametric study was undertaken to assess the effects of cohesion, unit weight, friction angle, surcharge pressure, and wall–soil friction angle on the active earth pressure, as well as the effects of the friction angle of backfill soil and wall–soil friction angle on the slip surface angle.

flat earth,"The aim of this study was to identify the opportunity of optimising the collection of solar energy as far as it is available in order to increase its utilisation. The second aim of this study was to enhance the performance of solar energy harvesters that depend on it through the appropriate determination of optimum solar collector tilt angles. In this study, ASHRAE clear sky model is applied to calculate the solar radiation; and the fundamental solar energy equations were programmed to determine optimum tilt angles in any location on the earth. The optimum tilt angle was presented in a polynomial form to enable the most convenient use of the function of latitude angle on a Julian day in a monthly, seasonal and an annual manner. According to the comparison between the obtained results with those of the local measured authoritative data and those of NASA published data, it can be safely recommended that these polynomials be used especially in mid and high latitudes ( > 20°) in the two hemispheres. The presented study could serve as a reference for the domestic solar electrical and thermal applications."
flat earth,"Relevant new clues to wave-particle interactions have been obtained in Earth's plasma sheet (PS). The plasma measurements made on Cluster spacecraft show that broadband (approximately 2-6 kHz) electrostatic emissions, in the PS boundary layer, are associated with cold counterstreaming electrons flowing at 5-12x10(3) km s(-1) through hot Maxwellian plasma. In the current sheet (CS), electromagnetic whistler mode waves (approximately 10-80 Hz) and compressional Alfvén waves (<2 Hz) are detected with flat-topped electron distributions whose cutoff speeds are approximately 15-17x10(3) km s(-1). These waves are damped in the central CS where |B|<or=1.5 nT, plasma beta approximately 100, and electron distributions isotropic. Three mechanisms are at work: the beta-dependent lower hybrid drift instability (LHDI), acceleration of electrons along the B field by the LHD waves and whistler mode emissions triggered by the cyclotron resonance instability."
flat earth,"A possible effect of electromagnetic field on high-speed ionized airflow is considered. Namely, the deceleration of a flying body due to the interaction of the electric current induced around the body with the magnetic field generated by an on-board magnetic system is studied. The principal scheme of magnetohydrodynamic interaction over the flat plate is presented. A physical and computational model of the magnetohydrodynamic interaction study corresponding to the Earth’s re-entry flight conditions is described. The primary goal of the study is to demonstrate the deceleration effect in terms of standard aerodynamic drag. Two test cases are considered: a small-scale (lab-scale) interaction zone size and a large-scale (space-scale) one. The primary result of the study is to show the feasibility of increasing the total drag of the body by more than an order of magnitude relative to the original one. The effect can be achieved by means of practically reasonable magnetic field amplitudes. Common to both cases is that the total drag grows as the magnetic field increases. The difference between the two cases is that significantly smaller magnetic fields are required in the space-scale case to increase aerodynamic drag than in the the lab-scale case. In any case, the drag control could potentially be used as high-speed flow control."
flat earth,"By cross-correlating both the Parkes Catalogue and the Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources with the arrival direction of the track-type neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we find the flat-spectrum blazar PKS 0723-008 as a good candidate for the high-energy neutrino event 5 (ID5). Apart from its coordinates matching those of ID5, PKS 0723-008 exhibits further interesting radio properties. Its spectrum is flat up to high Planck frequencies, and it produced a fivefold-increased radio flux density through the last decade. Based upon these radio properties we propose a scenario of binary black hole evolution leading to the observed high-energy neutrino emission. The main contributing events are the spin-flip of the dominant black hole, the formation of a new jet with significant particle acceleration and interaction with the surrounding material, with the corresponding increased radio flux. Doppler boosting from the underlying jet pointing to the Earth makes it possible to identify the origin of the neutrinos, so the merger itself is the form of an extended flat-spectrum radio emission, a key selection criterion to find traces of this complex process."
flat earth,"Cover story The U.S. coal industry is facing tough times. Demand for coal is dwindling, and the industry is under fire for polluting streams and rivers with coal ash and acid mine drainage. But in that waste, and in some cases in the coal itself, are valuable rare-earth elements that may be readily recovered. If researchers can figure out how to extract them economically, sales of rare earths could help pay for some of the cleanup costs now borne by the coal industry and several coal-mining states. Demand for rare-earth elements, which include the lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium, has ticked upward over the past few decades. The long list of high-tech products that rely on rare earths include cell phones, flat-screen TVs, electric cars, wind turbines, satellites, defense aircraft, and high-performance magnets. In 2015, global demand for rare-earth elements was 149,000 metric tons per year, according to Mary Anne"
flat earth,"Earthquake location programs for events recorded at regional to teleseismic distances have traditionally used travel-time tables such as the J-B tables (Jeffreys and Bullen, 1958), which were based on ray tracing in a laterally homogeneous spherical earth ( e.g., Boyd et al., 1984). Such travel-time tables may not give accurate locations for events located using stations at local to near-regional distances because of regional variations in the crustal and upper-mantle velocity structure—the regions of the Earth in which the first-arrival P and S waves spend most of their time for such events. Until recently, it was a nontrivial task to create travel-time tables for different spherical-earth velocity structures. Accordingly, for the past 30+ years, most locations for local and near-regionally-recorded events have used programs which used flat-earth ray tracing through constant-velocity layers. Examples of such programs are Hypo71 (Lee and Lahr, 1972), Hypoinverse (Klein, 1985), Fasthypo (Herrmann, 1979), and Hypoellipse (Lahr, 1999).

With the advent of digital recording and advances in telemetry, there are an increasing number of data sets which include arrival times for small to medium-sized events at both local and regional distances. Most researchers are aware of the fact that the assumption of lateral homogeneity may be invalid for event-station paths at larger epicentral distances, but when shown results as given in Figure 1 below, seismologists often express surprise that the spherical-earth travel-time corrections became significant ( e.g., > 0.1 s) at what seemed relatively small epicentral distances.

The purpose of this paper is to document the limitations of using a flat-earth velocity model to approximate travel times within the earth and to suggest strategies for minimizing errors in the analysis of events which are observed at distances for which the spherical-earth corrections become significant.

flat earth,"Blood Falls refers to the outflow of iron‐rich brine plumes under the Taylor Glacier in Antarctica, which have distinctive blood‐like red color. It was proposed that during the Cryogenian, Fe oxides of terrestrial origin accumulated under glaciers via a mechanism similar to the modern Blood Falls, although reports of iron deposits of such novel origin are lacking in literature. The Quruqsay iron formation is hosted in Neoproterozoic glacial sequences in the northern margin of the Tarim Craton in NW China and consist of 15 lenticular iron orebodies. The iron ores are mainly composed of fine Fe‐oxide aggregate and clastics, with the latter sometimes occurring as dropstones indicating glacial fluvial deposition. The hematite minerals show positive Ce and Y anomalies but lack positive Eu anomalies, with flat shale‐normalized rare Earth elements patterns. The hematite minerals also display remarkably negative εNd values and close‐to‐0 δ56Fe values, which collectively indicate that iron was sourced from continents rather than mid‐ocean ridge hydrothermal vents. Additionally, δ18O values of the hematite are consistent with the large ice‐volume during the Snowball Earth event. Evidence from the Quruqsay iron deposit suggest oxidation of terrestrial sub‐glacier iron‐bearing discharge in oceans of extensive glaciation, correlating with the predicted Blood Falls‐type iron deposits in the Neoproterozoic. The Quruqsay iron formation is a unique hematite‐rich iron deposit implying that subglacial lakes can be a significant repository for Fe2+ and that the volume of the Neoproterozoic glaciers may be much higher than the current glacier."
flat earth,"Here we report the bulk band structure, existence and evolution of topological surface states in rare earth mono-bismuthides, many of which exhibit pronounced magnetic transitions at low temperature due to partially filled f shell. Utilizing synchrotron-based photoemission spectroscopy, we determined the three-dimensional bulk band structure, despite significant kz broadening in the photoemission spectra. In the high temperature paramagnetic phase, we unambiguously identified the bulk band inversion and corresponding topological surface states, which consist of V shaped Dirac cones and relatively flat surface states. The topological surface states can be substantially tuned by varying rare earth elements (or the number of f electrons), which is in good agreement with density-functional theory calculations assuming local f electrons. Our study therefore establishes rare earth mono-bismuthides as an interesting class of materials possessing tunable topological properties and magnetism, providing a promising platform to search for novel properties in correlated topological materials."
flat earth,"Earth surface evolution, like many natural phenomena typified by fluctuations on a wide range of scales and deterministic smoothing, results in a statistically rough surface. We present theory demonstrating that scaling exponents of topographic and stratigraphic statistics arise from long‐time averaging of noisy surface evolution rather than specific landscape evolution processes. This is demonstrated through use of “elastic” Langevin equations that generically describe disturbance from a flat earth surface using a noise term that is smoothed deterministically via sediment transport. When smoothing due to transport is a local process, the geologic record self organizes such that a specific Sadler effect and topographic power spectral density (PSD) emerge. Variations in PSD slope reflect the presence or absence and character of nonlocality of sediment transport. The range of observed stratigraphic Sadler slopes captures the same smoothing feature combined with the presence of long‐range spatial correlation in topographic disturbance."
flat earth,"Explicit compact expressions were obtained for the far displacement field of Rayleigh and Love waves generated by force configurations which served to simulate shear-type faults with arbitrary dip and slip. The medium transfer functions for dipolar sources were computed for a Gutenberg flat continental earth model with 23 layers. These were then used to obtain universal radiation pattern charts for couple- and double-couple-type sources at various depths over the period range 50 to 350 sec. It was demonstrated by means of few typical examples that the radiation patterns of Rayleigh waves may depend strongly on the depth of the source, and unlike the fundamental Love mode may be rather sensitive to small variations in frequency. For a given source and frequency the radiation pattern may differ considerably from one mode to another."
flat earth,"A variety of actively precipitating mineral environments preserve morphological evidence of microbial biosignatures. One such environment with preserved microbial biosignatures is the oxidized portion of a massive sulfide deposit, or gossan, such as that at Iron Mountain, California. This gossan may serve as a mineralogical analogue to some ancient martian environments due to the presence of oxidized iron and sulfate species, and minerals that only form in acidic aqueous conditions, in both environments. Evaluating the potential biogenicity of cryptic textures in such martian gossans requires an understanding of how microbial textures form biosignatures on Earth. The iron-oxide-dominated composition and morphology of terrestrial, nonbranching filamentous microbial biosignatures may be distinctive of the underlying formation and preservation processes. The Iron Mountain gossan consists primarily of ferric oxide (hematite), hydrous ferric oxide (HFO, predominantly goethite), and jarosite group minerals, categorized into in situ gossan, and remobilized iron deposits. We interpret HFO filaments, found in both gossan types, as HFO-mineralized microbial filaments based in part on (1) the presence of preserved central filament lumina in smooth HFO mineral filaments that are likely molds of microbial filaments, (2) mineral filament formation in actively precipitating iron-oxide environments, (3) high degrees of mineral filament bending consistent with a flexible microbial filament template, and (4) the presence of bare microbial filaments on gossan rocks. Individual HFO filaments are below the resolution of the Mars Curiosity and Mars 2020 rover cameras, but sinuous filaments forming macroscopic matlike textures are resolvable. If present on Mars, available cameras may resolve these features identified as similar to terrestrial HFO filaments and allow subsequent evaluation for their biogenicity by synthesizing geochemical, mineralogical, and morphological analyses. Sinuous biogenic filaments could be preserved on Mars in an iron-rich environment analogous to Iron Mountain, with the Pahrump Hills region and Hematite Ridge in Gale Crater as tentative possibilities."
flat earth,"Employing a hybrid density functional theory, we reveal the origin of the large absorption coefficient in BaSi2, which is roughly two to eighty times larger at ħω − Eg = 0.5 eV than other conventional absorbers such as Si, GaAs, CdTe, CuInSe2, and Cu2ZnSnS4. This is explained on the basis of the electronic band structure of BaSi2, whereby the lowest conduction band (CB) has a small dispersion, owing to the localized Ba-d states, resulting in flat bands. Consequently, these flat bands contribute to a wide range of optical absorption in the low-energy region and lead to high optical activity in BaSi2."
flat earth,"Understanding the structural, physical and chemical properties of the surface and interfaces of different metal-oxides and their possible applications in photo-catalysis and biology is a very important emerging research field. Motivated in this direction, this article would enable understanding of how different fluids, particularly water, interact with oxide surfaces. We have studied the water contact angle of 3d transition metal oxide thin films of SrTiO3, and of 4f rare-earth oxide thin films of Lu2O3. These metal oxides were grown using pulsed laser deposition and they are atomically flat and with known orientation and explicitly characterized for their structure and composition. Further study was done on the effects of oxygen vacancies on the water contact angle of the 3d and 4f oxides. For 3d SrTiO3 oxide with oxygen vacancies, we have observed an increase in hydroxylation with consequent increase of wettability which is in line with the previous reports whereas an interesting opposite trend was seen in the case of rare-earth Lu2O3 oxide. Density functional theory simulations of water interaction on the above mentioned systems have also been presented to further substantiate our experimental findings."
flat earth,"Investigation of children's understanding of the earth provides important insights into the origins of children's knowledge, the structure of their concepts, and the development of scientific ideas. Vosniadou & Brewer (1992) proposed that, under the influence of intuitive constraints and observations, children form naïve but coherent mental models of the earth: for example they believe it to be flat, or that we live inside a hollow sphere. To test this claim, 59 children aged 6 – 8 years and 33 adults were given multiple-choice questions and a 3D model selection task. This approach avoided the criticisms of recent studies by providing participants with a full range of possible answers. Even the youngest children preferred scientific responses and so demonstrated some knowledge of the earth. Only 10% of the children showed any evidence of naïve mental models; other participants who gave non-scientific answers were inconsistent and unsystematic. It is argued that intuitive constraints have little or no influence on the development of children's ideas in this domain, and that emerging knowledge of the earth progresses from being fragmented to consistently scientific."
flat earth,"N-Type pyrite (FeS2) thin films, deposited on titanium substrates, have been synthesized and photoelectrochemically characterized. Its flat band potential has been estimated to be −0.75 ± 0.05V vs Ag/AgCl by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The corresponding energy level diagram of the FeS2/electrolyte interface has been established. Profuse hydrogen flows have been produced under visible light illumination of FeS2 photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) at different bias potentials. Their values, measured by mass spectrometry (MS), were higher than 5 μmol H2/min·cm2. Hydrogen photogeneration efficiencies of ∼8% have been reached."
flat earth,"Significance Early climate and weather models, constrained by computing resources, made numerical approximations on modeling the real world. One process, the radiative transfer of sunlight through the atmosphere, has always been a costly component. As computational ability expanded, these models added resolution, processes, and numerical methods to reduce errors and become the Earth system models that we use today. While many of the original approximations have since been improved, one—that the Earth’s surface and atmosphere are locally flat—remains in current models. Correcting from flat to spherical atmospheres leads to regionally differential solar heating at rates comparable to the climate forcing by greenhouse gases and aerosols. In addition, spherical atmospheres change how we evaluate the aerosol direct radiative forcing. Sunlight drives the Earth’s weather, climate, chemistry, and biosphere. Recent efforts to improve solar heating codes in climate models focused on more accurate treatment of the absorption spectrum or fractional clouds. A mostly forgotten assumption in climate models is that of a flat Earth atmosphere. Spherical atmospheres intercept 2.5 W⋅m−2 more sunlight and heat the climate by an additional 1.5 W⋅m−2 globally. Such a systematic shift, being comparable to the radiative forcing change from preindustrial to present, is likely to produce a discernible climate shift that would alter a model’s skill in simulating current climate. Regional heating errors, particularly at high latitudes, are several times larger. Unlike flat atmospheres, constituents in a spherical atmosphere, such as clouds and aerosols, alter the total amount of energy received by the Earth. To calculate the net cooling of aerosols in a spherical framework, one must count the increases in both incident and reflected sunlight, thus reducing the aerosol effect by 10 to 14% relative to using just the increase in reflected. Simple fixes to the current flat Earth climate models can correct much of this oversight, although some inconsistencies will remain."
flat earth,"The radial surface deflection of a spherical earth model appropriate to time scales characteristic of glacial loading is compared with the associated halfspace response. For that purpose the analytical solution for a Maxwell sphere surrounded by a thick elastic shell is derived under the assumption of incompressibility. The half-space approximation is deduced as a special case directly from the spherical solution. Comparison of the response spectra, for different thicknesses of the elastic shell, reveals only minor differences. In the spatial domain, the half-space approximation may, nevertheless, diverge significantly from the spherical solution. For a disk load radius R = 800 km (Fennoscandia), the half-space approximation is adequate, whereas it is usually inappropriate if R = 1600 km (Laurentia). The sensitivity of the response to the thickness of the elastic shell is also investigated. For R = 800 km, the surface deflection in the central region below the load is fairly diagnostic of the shell thickness. If R = 1600 km, the peripheral region is more sensitive to this parameter."
flat earth,"In the present paper, design of solar chimney (SC) and earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) to meet the thermal need of flat buildings are studied regarding adaptive thermal comfort criteria. Investigation on the effects of geometric features shows that the design of SC with the air gap and outlet sizes of 0.2 m and also EAHE with the diameter and length of 0.5 and 25.0 m reveals better performance. Thermal comfort analysis shows that the SC is capable to power the underground heating system during few hours of the sunny days even at the ambient temperature as low as 0°C and the heating demand of 1000 W without needing the auxiliary devices. In addition, the required numbers of SCs and the underground air channels are strongly influenced by environmental outdoor conditions and heating demand of building and are approximately calculated by: roomvolume/50and2×(roomvolume/50)+1, respectively."
flat earth,"Doping of rare-earth metal oxides into nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (NTD) films is known to improve performance for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications; however, the reasons for this improvement are not well understood. To explore the enhancement mechanism, an electrical and electrochemical study of rare-earth oxide-doped NTD films was performed. Doped films were found to be 40–50 times more conductive than undoped films, with linear current–voltage characteristics and decreased light sensitivity. Cyclic voltammograms of doped samples show an enhanced scan rate dependence in the deep trap regime due to a slower charge trapping rate. Finally, electrochemical impedance measurements reveal a decrease in space charge density and a shift in the flat-band potential. Taken together, these results suggest that charge transfer from the rare earth oxide neutralizes the deep trap states in the NTD film, decreasing charge scattering, and improving the NTD performance as an electron acceptor and electron ..."
flat earth,"In June 1993, REOSC got the contract for the optical fabrication of a Three Mirror Anastigmat (TMA) for a high resolution space camera of 1-meter focal length, F/4 relative aperture and +/- 2.125 by +/- 0.425 degrees object field angle. After having shown the various advantages of such type of optics, we will discuss the issues of design, fabrication, alignment, and testing of such a system. TMA are a promising type of optical systems that can constitute performant upgrades of present earth observation projects. Preliminary test results will be discussed."
flat earth,"AbstractBased on the limit-equilibrium concept, a new method for calculating the active earth pressure acting on a rigid retaining wall that moves horizontally away from soil mass is proposed. Using this method, the trajectory of the minor principal stress resulting from the soil arching effect in retained soil mass is considered, and the arc-shaped axis of the minor principal stress is approximated to a linear axis using the improved horizontal flat-element method. The effects of soil’s internal frictional angle, its unit weight, the wall–soil friction angle relative to the active earth pressure, and the point of application of the resultant active earth pressure are investigated. Finally, the proposed method is applied to two existing tests for rigid retaining walls with different heights. A comparison of the predicted and measured values shows that the proposed method yields satisfactory results."
flat earth,"The Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout is a solar sail mission whose objective is to scout at least one Near Earth Asteroid to help prepare for human missions to Near Earth Asteroids. NEA Scout will launch as a secondary payload on the first SLS-Orion mission. NEA Scout will perform a small trim maneuver shortly after deploy from the spent SLS upper stage using a cold gas propulsion system, but from that point on will depend entirely on the solar sail for thrust. As such, it is important to accurately characterize the thrust of the sail in order to achieve mission success. Additionally, the solar sail creates a relatively large solar disturbance torque that must be mitigated. For early mission design studies a flat plate model of the solar sail with a fixed center of pressure was adequate, but as mission concepts and the sail design matured, greater fidelity was required. Here we discuss the progress to a three-dimensional sail model that includes the effects of tension and thermal deformation that has been derived from a large structural Finite Element Model (FEM) developed by the Langley Research Center. We have found that the deformed sail membrane affects torque relatively much more than thrust; a flat plate model could potentially model thrust well enough to close mission design studies, but a three-dimensional solar sail is essential to control system design. The three-dimensional solar sail model revealed that thermal deformations of unshielded booms would create unacceptably large solar disturbance torques. The original large FEM model was used in control and mission simulations, but was resulted in simulations with prohibitive run times. This led us to adapt the Generalized Sail Model (GSM) of Rios-Reyes. A design reference sail model has been baselined for NEA Scout and has been used to design the mission and control system for the sailcraft. Additionally, since NEA Scout uses reaction wheels for attitude pointing and control, the solar torque model is essentially to successfully design the NEA Scout momentum management control system. We have also updated the estimate of diffusivity used for the aluminized sail material based on optical testing of wrinkled sail material. The model presented here represents the current state of the art of NASA's ability to model solar sail thrust and torque."
flat earth,"This paper presents a statistical analysis showing additional evidence that Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from Google Earth is commendable and has a good correlation with ASTER (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data. The accuracy of DEM elevation points from Google Earth was compared against that of DEMs from ASTER and SRTM for flat, hilly and mountainous sections of a pre-selected rural watershed. For each section, a total of 5,000 DEM elevation points were extracted as samples from each type of DEM data. The DEM data from Google Earth and SRTM for flat and hilly sections are strongly correlated with the R2 of 0.791 and 0.891 respectively. Even stronger correlation is shown for the mountainous section where the R2 values between Google Earth's DEM and ASTER's and between Google Earth's DEM and SRTM's DEMs are respectively 0.917 and 0.865. Further accuracy testing was carried out by utilising the DEM dataset to delineate Muar River's watershed boundary using ArcSWAT2009, a hydrological modelling software. The result shows that the percentage differences of the watershed size delineated from Google Earth's DEM compared to those derived from Department of Irrigation and Drainage's data (using 20m-contour topographic map), ASTER and SRTM data are 9.6%, 10.6%, and 7.6% respectively. It is therefore justified to conclude that the DEM derived from Google Earth is relatively as acceptable as DEMs from other sources."
flat earth,"The feedback instability in the ionospheric Alfvén resonator in Earth's magnetosphere is examined using a two‐dimensional multifluid numerical model of coupled ionosphere and magnetosphere. Two simulation configurations are used to demonstrate that the instability occurs under an assumption that is unrealistic for Earth's ionosphere. In the first configuration, a flat sheet height‐integrated conducting boundary replaces the ionospheric E layer. In the second configuration, plasma dynamics in a simplified E layer is resolved ignoring ion production, loss, and diffusion. For the same parameters (plasma and neutral density profiles and convection electric field), the instability develops only with the flat sheet boundary. When the E layer is resolved, the variation of ion‐neutral collision frequencies with altitude produces vertical shear in the horizontal ion flow velocity. The shear prevents density perturbations from remaining field aligned, causing them to decay rather than grow. It is suggested that the instability cannot occur in Earth's ionosphere because ion‐neutral collision frequencies always have a significant variation with altitude through the E layer."

The focus here is on saturated clays, and the effect of soil stress history on the horizontal stress index is discussed in detail. The obtained results appear to be in good agreement with published and new field data, leading to the proposal of two new expressions for estimating the overconsolidation ratio and the earth pressure coefficient at rest directly from flat dilatometer tests in estuarine clays."

flat earth,"We describe the development and validation of an operational space weather tool to forecast propagation delay times between L1 and Earth using the Weimer and King (2008) tilted phase front technique. A simple flat plane convection delay method is currently used by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) to propagate the solar wind from a monitoring satellite located at L1 to a point upstream of the magnetosphere. This technique assumes that all observed solar wind discontinuities, such as interplanetary shocks and interplanetary coronal mass ejection boundaries, are in a flat plane perpendicular to the Sun‐Earth line traveling in the GSE X direction at the observed solar wind velocity. In reality, these phase plane fronts can have significantly tilted orientations, and by relying on a ballistic propagation method, delay time errors of ±15 min are common. In principle, the propagation time delay product presented here should more accurately predict L1 to Earth transit times by taking these tilted phase plane fronts into account. This algorithm, which is based on the work of Weimer and King (2008), is currently running in real time in test mode at SWPC as part of the SWPC test bed. We discuss the current algorithm performance, and via our detailed validation study, show that there is no significant difference between the two propagation methods when run in a real‐time operational environment."
flat earth,"As a source of strategic commodities for high technologies, the deposits of rare earth elements (REEs) in China are a world-class phenomenon. The combination of the world's largest accumulation of REEs in the Bayan Obo deposit and the low cost of mining the extremely valuable heavy REEs from residual deposits makes China almost a monopoly producer. Research on a range of Chinese deposits shows that not only hypogene but also secondary processes create economic REE deposits. These deposits have characteristic REE distribution patterns, which range from primary light REE enrichment in carbonatites from the Himalayan Mianning–Dechang orogenic belt and in metamorphosed carbonatite and polyphase mineralization at Bayan Obo, through unusual flat REE patterns in carbonatites from the Qinling orogenic belt, to strong secondary heavy REE enrichment in residual clays from southern China."
flat earth,"Abstract The institutions that made American science famous figure less and less in the leadership and management of American science. Causes for this decline, especially evident in ocean and atmospheric sciences, include large programs that cut across institutions, the volume of federal funds, the scale of scientific instruments and facilities, easier travel and telecommunications, and time horizons of entrepreneurial science. The pattern emerging results not from a deliberate policy of bypassing major institutions and their management, but from radical changes in the structure of scientific activity. Science is matching industry in a trend toward flatter management and functional, rather than geographic, organization. Some risks and needs arise with the new balance—or imbalance—of power."
flat earth,"Abstract. Wetlands, often called the “kidneys of the earth”, play an important role
in maintaining ecological balance, conserving water resources, replenishing
groundwater and controlling soil erosion. Wetland mapping is very
challenging because of its complicated temporal dynamics and large spatial
and spectral heterogeneity. An accurate global 30 m wetland dataset that can
simultaneously cover inland and coastal zones is lacking. This study
proposes a novel method for wetland mapping by combining an automatic sample
extraction method, existing multi-sourced products, satellite time-series
images and a stratified classification strategy. This approach allowed for
the generation of the first global 30 m wetland map with a fine
classification system (GWL_FCS30), including five inland
wetland sub-categories (permanent water, swamp, marsh, flooded flat and
saline) and three coastal tidal wetland sub-categories (mangrove, salt
marsh and tidal flats), which was developed using Google Earth Engine
platform. We first combined existing multi-sourced global wetland products,
expert knowledge, training sample refinement rules and visual
interpretation to generate large and geographically distributed wetland
training samples. Second, we integrated the Landsat reflectance time-series
products and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to generate various water-level and
phenological information to capture the complicated temporal dynamics and
spectral heterogeneity of wetlands. Third, we applied a stratified
classification strategy and the local adaptive random forest classification
models to produce the wetland dataset with a fine classification system at
each 5∘×5∘geographical tile in 2020. Lastly,
GWL_FCS30, mosaicked by 961 5∘×5∘ regional wetland maps, was validated using 25 708 validation
samples, which achieved an overall accuracy of 86.44 % and a kappa
coefficient of 0.822. The cross-comparisons with other global wetland
products demonstrated that the GWL_FCS30 dataset performed
better in capturing the spatial patterns of wetlands and had significant
advantages over the diversity of wetland sub-categories. The statistical
analysis showed that the global wetland area reached 6.38 million km2,
including 6.03 million km2 of inland wetlands and 0.35 million km2
of coastal tidal wetlands, approximately 72.96 % of which were distributed
poleward of 40∘ N. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed
method is suitable for large-area wetland mapping and that the
GWL_FCS30 dataset is an accurate wetland mapping product that
has the potential to provide vital support for wetland management. The
GWL_FCS30 dataset in 2020 is freely available at

flat earth,"Score-based generative models (SGMs) are a powerful class of generative models that exhibit remarkable empirical performance. Score-based generative modelling (SGM) consists of a ``noising'' stage, whereby a diffusion is used to gradually add Gaussian noise to data, and a generative model, which entails a ``denoising'' process defined by approximating the time-reversal of the diffusion. Existing SGMs assume that data is supported on a Euclidean space, i.e. a manifold with flat geometry. In many domains such as robotics, geoscience or protein modelling, data is often naturally described by distributions living on Riemannian manifolds and current SGM techniques are not appropriate. We introduce here Riemannian Score-based Generative Models (RSGMs), a class of generative models extending SGMs to Riemannian manifolds. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of manifolds, and in particular with earth and climate science spherical data."
flat earth,"Skywave over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems have important long-range strategic warning values. They exploit skywave propagation reflection of high frequency signals from the ionosphere, which provides the ultra-long-range surveillance capabilities to detect and track maneuvering targets. Current OTH radar systems are capable of localizing targets in range and azimuth but are unable to achieve reliable instantaneous altitude estimation. Most existing height measurement methods of skywave OTH radar systems have taken advantage of the micromultipath effect and been considered in the flat earth model. However, the flat earth model is not proper since large error is inevitable, when the detection range is over one thousand kilometers. In order to avoid the error caused by the flat earth model, in this paper, an earth curvature model is introduced into OTH radar altimetry methods. The simulation results show that application of the earth curvature model can effectively reduce the estimation error."
flat earth,"The North China Craton (NCC) was originally formed by the amalgamation of the eastern and western blocks along an orogenic belt at ∼1.9 Ga. After cratonization, the NCC was essentially stable until the Mesozoic, when intense felsic magmatism and related mineralization, deformation, pull-apart basins, and exhumation of the deep crust widely occurred, indicative of destruction or decratonization. Accompanying this destruction was significant removal of the cratonic keel and lithospheric transformation, whereby the thick (∼200 km) and refractory Archean lithosphere mantle was replaced by a thin (<80 km) juvenile one. The decratonization of the NCC was driven by flat slab subduction, followed by a rollback of the paleo-Pacific plate during the late Mesozoic. A global synthesis indicates that cratons are mainly destroyed by oceanic subduction, although mantle plumes might also trigger lithospheric thinning through thermal erosion. Widespread crust-derived felsic magmatism and large-scale ductile deformation can be regarded as petrological and structural indicators of craton destruction. ▪ A craton, a kind of ancient continental block on Earth, was formed mostly in the early Precambrian (>1.8 Ga). ▪ A craton is characterized by a rigid lithospheric root, which provides longevity and stability during its evolutionary history. ▪ Some cratons, such as the North China Craton, can be destroyed by losing their stability, manifested by magmatism, deformation, earthquake, etc."
flat earth,"Geologic evidence of tropical sea level glaciation in the Neoproterozoic is one of the cornerstones of the Snowball Earth hypothesis. However, it is not clear during what part of the Snowball Earth cycle that land-based glaciers or ice sheets could have grown: just before the collapse with tropical oceans still open, or after the collapse with oceans completely covered with sea ice. In the former state, the tropics may still have been too warm to allow flowing ice to reach sea level; in the latter, snowfall minus sublimation may have been too small to build significant ice. These possibilities are tested with a coupled global climate model and dynamic ice sheet model, with two continental configurations (∼750 Ma, 540 Ma) and two CO 2 levels bracketing the collapse to Snowball Earth (840, 420 ppmv). Prior to collapse large high-latitude ice sheets form at 750 Ma, but with flat continents, no low-latitude ice grows at 750 or 540 Ma. In the absence of reliable knowledge of Neoproterozoic topography, we apply a small-scale test profile in the ice sheet model, representing a coastal mountain range on which glaciers can be initiated and flow seaward. Prior to collapse, almost all low-latitude test glaciers fail to reach the coast at 750 Ma, but at 540 Ma many do reach the sea. After the collapse to full Snowball conditions, the hydrologic cycle is greatly reduced, but extensive kilometer-thick ice sheets form slowly on low-latitude continents within a few 100,000 years, both at 750 Ma and 540 Ma."
flat earth,"In the late-1990’s, two movies were released that dealt with the theme of an asteroid on a trajectory directly towards earth. One of these films, Mimi Leder’s Deep Impact (1998) held the opinion that a collision was inevitable and all we could do to attempt to survive was hide, wait it out, and hope for the best. The ending of the film features a poignant scene with a father and daughter watching the tidal wave from the collision come ashore. The other film, Armageddon (1998) directed by Michael Bay, combatted the potential impact head-on. The government sent a team up to blow the asteroid to smithereens in order to prevent catastrophe. Thomas L. Friedman, in his latest book, sounds the alarm for policy makers, innovators, and everyone else. While an asteroid is not coming straight towards the planet Earth, according to Friedman, Al Gore, and others, global catastrophe lies on the horizon. This book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution – and How it Can Renew America alerts readers to three crises points we have arrived at. First, our world is hot and getting hotter due to the global warming phenomenon. Second, our world is “flat.” Friedman uses the term to refer to the notion that technology – especially the internet – has made the world smaller than it was fifty years ago. There is a growing middle class, consumerism runs rampant, and people are more likely to know someone in India than the name of their next-door neighbor. Finally, our world is crowded and getting more-so all the time. According to Friedman, these problems should have been solved yesterday. One thing Friedman is very good at doing in Hot, Flat, and Crowded is providing us with concrete examples – both of the problems as they present themselves in the world and of solutions that are occurring in various parts of the world. For instance, Friedman calls for an “energy internet” in chapter ten. He takes this example from Washington State’s Olympic Peninsula where smart appliances save energy. He describes a chip that manages the amount of energy used by appliances. (pp. 238-239) Friedman calls for us to treat the year 2000 as the start of a new era. This is the Energy-Climate Era (ECE). Our world is rapidly changing and unless we respond we are in big trouble. Friedman says that the biggest threats to our way of living are: Too many people wanting to live like Americans, Petro-dictatorship, Abnormal weather patterns, Loss in biodiversity, and Energy Poverty. The solution to the problem, he suggests, is a combination of awareness, innovation, and radical change – “Code Green.” He goes so far to suggest, in chapter twelve that the government offer financial benefits to companies searching for solutions to our global problem. He paints a picture of an ecologically responsible world, “Everyone now has an SBB—your own personal energy dashboard. Just as when you sign up for cable television you get a set-top box or digital recorder with it, now, when you sign up for the Energy Internet...you get an SBB [Small Black Box]” (224). While Friedman offers examples of solutions for the current energy crisis, loss of biodiversity, and overcrowding, it appears more as if he leans towards the position of Mimi Leder’s characters in Deep Impact. While he knows that something has to be done in order to change the current trajectory of exponential growth of problems, it’s never really that clear as to what it is that has to be done. Friedman does suggest a “formula” based upon Google’s greening formula:"
flat earth,"This article investigates how disinformation circulates on social media as adversarial narratives embedded in identity-driven controversies. Empirically, the article reports on the flat Earth echo chamber on YouTube, a controversial group arguing that the earth is a plane, not a sphere. By analyzing how they weave their arguments, this study demonstrates that disinformation circulates through identity-based grievances. As grudges intensify, back-and-forth argumentation becomes a form of knowing that solidifies viewpoints. Moreover, the argument resists fact-checking because it stokes the contradictions of identity work through grievances (pathos) and group identification (ethos). The conceptual contribution proposes a two-phase framework for how disinformation circulates on social media. The first phase, “seeding,” is when malicious actors strategically insert deceptions by masquerading their legitimacy (e.g., fake news). The second phase, “echoing,” enlists participants to cocreate the contentious narratives that disseminate disinformation. A definition of disinformation is proposed: Disinformation is an adversarial campaign that weaponizes multiple rhetorical strategies and forms of knowing—including not only falsehoods but also truths, half-truths, and value-laden judgments—to exploit and amplify identity-driven controversies. Finally, the paper has implications for policy makers in handling the spread of disinformation on social media."

Bottom sediments were collected from 27 sampling stations on board UMT Discovery II vessel using a Smith McIntyre grab and analyzed for rare earth elements (REEs) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results showed that the REEs patterns in sediments reflected the source rock patterns with an overall order of abundance such as: light rare earth elements (LREE) > middle rare earth element (MREE) > high rare earth elements (HREE). The chondrite normalized patterns of REEs showed enrichment of LREEs over HREEs with La/Yb of 13.6 while the chondrite normalized value showed low (Gd/Yb)N ratios (2.12) which was illustrated in the flat HREE pattern. The chondrite normalized REE patterns of sediments showed the enrichment of LREE and depletion of HREE. From our findings, REEs concentrations in the study area were found to be of geogenic origins and the distributions were not influenced by anthropogenic sources."
flat earth,"Slab melting has been suggested as a likely source of adakitic arc magmas (i.e., andesitic and dacitic magmas strongly depleted in Y and heavy rare earth elements). Existing numerical and petrologic models, however, restrict partial melting to very young (≤ 5 Ma) oceanic crust (typically at 60–80 km depth). Paradoxically, most of the known Pliocene-Quaternary adakite occurrences are related to subduction of 10–45 Ma lithosphere, which should not be able to melt under normal subduction-zone thermal gradients. We propose an unusual mode of subduction known as flat subduction, occurring in ∼10% of the world's convergent margins, that can produce the temperature and pressure conditions necessary for fusion of moderately old oceanic crust. Of the 10 known flat subduction regions worldwide, eight are linked to present or recent (<6 Ma) occurrences of adakitic magmas. Observations from Chile, Ecuador, and Costa Rica suggest a three-stage evolution: (1) steep subduction produces a narrow calc-alkaline arc, typically ∼300 km from the trench, above the asthenospheric wedge; (2) once flat subduction begins, the lower plate travels several hundred kilometers at nearly the same depth, thus remaining in a pressure-temperature window allowing slab melting over this broad distance; and (3) once flat subduction continues for several million years, the asthenospheric wedge disappears, and a volcanic gap results, as in modern-day central Chile or Peru. The proposed hypothesis, which reconciles thermal models with geochemical observations, has broad implications for the study of arc magmatism and for the thermal evolution of convergent margins."
flat earth,"Laser heating plays an essential role for in-situ high pressure high temperature studies into the physical and chemical properties of materials in the diamond anvil cell (DAC) and minerals at conditions relevant to the Earth's deep interior. High temperature experiments in the multi-Mbar (over 100 GPa) pressure range require the use of very small samples and consequently the utmost stability and controllability of the laser heating is crucial. To accomplish this, we have modified the laser heating system at GSECARS employing newly developed beam shaping optics combined with two diode-pumped, single mode fiber lasers. Varying the settings of the laser heating system, we were able to shape the beam to almost any desired intensity profile and size on the surface of the sample in the DAC, including tight focus, flat top, trident and doughnut types. The advantages and excellent performance of the flat top laser heating (FTLH) technique were demonstrated in melting experiments on germanium in the DAC at pressures up to 40 GPa."
flat earth,"of the belt formed at � 4·28 Ga, which would make it the only known remnant of Hadean crust preserved on Earth. The dominant lithology of the belt has a mafic composition that consists of gneisses ranging from cummingtonite amphibolite to garnet^biotite schist composed of variable proportions of cummingtonite þ biotite þ quartz, � plagioclasegarnetanthophyllitecordierite. The composition of this unit ranges from basalt to andesite and it is divided into two distinct geochemical groups that are stratigraphical- ly separated by a banded iron formation (BIF). At the base of the se- quence, the mafic unit is mainly basaltic in composition and generally has relatively low Al2O3 and high TiO2 contents, whereas above the BIF, the unit is characterized by high Al2O3 and low TiO2 contents and exhibits a wider range of compositions from bas- altic to andesitic. The low-Ti unit can be further subdivided into a trace element depleted and a trace element enriched subgroup. The high-Ti unit is characterized by relatively flat REE patterns as opposed to the low-Ti gneisses, which display light REE-enriched profiles with flat heavy REE slopes. The incompatible element depleted low-Ti rocks have U-shaped REE profiles.The geochemical groups have compositional analogues in three types of ultramafic sills that exhibit the same stratigraphic succession. Generally, the mafic gneisses have low Ca, Na and Sr contents, with many samples having CaO contents51wt %. Such low Ca contents are unlikely to represent the original composition of their igneous precursors and are interpreted to reflect intensive alteration of plagioclase. These compositional characteristics along with the presence of cordier- ite þ anthophyllite suggest that the protoliths of the mafic gneisses were mafic volcanic rocks exhibiting variable degrees of hydrothermal alteration. The high-Ti compositional type shares geochemical char- acteristics with tholeiitic volcanic suites with low Al2O3 and high TiO2 contents and is consistent with crystal fractionation at low pressures under dry conditions. In contrast, the low-Ti compositional group is geochemically similar to boninitic and calc-alkaline volcanic suites.The high Al2O3 and lowTiO2 contents in the andesitic com- positions suggest the early crystallization of Fe^Ti oxides and late appearance of plagioclase, and are more consistent with fractionation at elevated water pressures. The succession from 'tholeitic' to 'calc-alkaline' magmatism seen in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt is typical of the volcanic successions of many younger Archean green- stone belts. Regardless of the exact tectonic setting, this volcanic suc- cession suggests that the geological processes responsible for the formation and evolution of Archean greenstone belts were active at 3·8 Ga and perhaps as early as 4· 3G a."
flat earth,"Abstract : The measurements of the energy spectra and angular distributions of earth albedo neutrons from 10 to 100 MeV are reported. The measurements were made at 40 degrees N. geomagnetic latitude from a balloon at 120,000 ft. (below 4.6 g/sq. cm. of the residual atmosphere). The fluxes of upward moving neutrons at angles of 20 degrees to 70 degrees to the vertical show that the intensities of lower energy neutrons are peaked near the vertical. The distributions are integrated over angle to give a vertical energy distribution for upward moving neutrons that is flat to 50 MeV, then drops off with energy. The absolute neutron flux is of the correct strength and the energy distribution is of the correct shape for the albedo neutrons to be the source of the protons trapped in the earth's inner radiation belt. An upper limit for solar neutrons from 20 to 60 MeV for the quiet sun on September 26, 1971 is 1.0 x 10 to the minus 3rd power neutrons/sq. cm.-s with a 95% confidence limit. (Author)"
flat earth,"The (550‐530Ma) alkaline magmatic suite of the Amram Massif, southern Israel, was emplaced during the transition from an orogenic to an intra-plate tectonic setting in the northeastern Arabian‐Nubian Shield (ANS). The suite ranges from 45 6t o 788 wt % SiO2, and consists of rhyolites, alkali quartz syenites, quartz syenites, monzonites, and co-magmatic mafic to felsic alkaline dikes. These rocks define a continuous chemical evolutionary trend and reveal a correlation between decreasing stratigraphic age and increasing silica content. The felsic members of the suite display A-type characteristics and are genetically linked through fractionation to the more mafic ones. Moderately positive initial eNd values (a2 05), low initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values (07036 2), high MgO and Fe2O3 concentrations (410‐895 and 100‐125 wt %, respectively) and relatively flat rare earth element patterns [(La/Yb)na 64 09] in the Amram mafic dikes (456‐495 wt % SiO2), suggest their derivation from the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, above the garnet stability zone. The MELTS program was used to quantitatively model the chemical evolution of the suite. Extensive anhydrous fractionation (490%), of plagioclase, alkali-feldspar, clinopyroxene, olivine, and minor Timagnetite and apatite from parental mafic magmas, represented by the Amram mafic dikes, produced the rhyolitic compositions as well as the intermediate members of the suite. This suggests the presence of a large unexposed body of cumulate rocks at depth, as well as fusion of a large source-region (equivalent to an 5km layer) in the lithospheric mantle. Regarded as a representative example for similar A-type outcrops in this region, this petrogenetic model further suggests that Neoproterozoic‐Early Cambrian A-type magmatism in the northeastern ANS represents a significant post-orogenic addition of mantlederived material to the juvenile crust. This magmatic episode was of a similar magnitude to that of the Cenozoic, extensionrelated, alkaline volcanism of the Arabian plate."

However, recent developments in multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) have brought a new dimension to this field. In addition to its simple and robust sample introduction, high sample throughput, and high mass resolution, the flat-topped peaks generated by this technique provide for accurate and precise determination of isotope ratios with precision reaching 0.001%, comparable to that achieved with TIMS. These features, in combination with the ability of the ICP source to ionize nearly all elements in the periodic table, have resulted in an increased use of MC-ICP-MS for such measurements in various sample matrices. To determine accurate and precise isotope ratios with MC-ICP-MS, utmost care must be exercised during sample preparation, optimization of the instrument, and mass bias corrections. Unfortunately, there are inconsistencies and errors evident in many MC-ICP-MS publications, including errors in mass bias correction models. This review examines ""state-of-the-art"" methodologies presented in the literature for achievement of precise and accurate determinations of isotope ratios by MC-ICP-MS. Some general rules for such accurate and precise measurements are suggested, and calculations of combined uncertainty of the data using a few common mass bias correction models are outlined."

 By means of the Biswas-Knopoff (1970) transformation, programs for the computation of the Love-wave response to a point source in a flat structure can be modified, quite easily, to compute the response in a sphere."
flat earth,"The MODIS Protoflight Model, launched on-board the NASA EOS Terra spacecraft on 18 December 1999, has been in operation for more than two years, providing the science community with calibrated data sets for global studies of the Earth's land, oceans and atmosphere. MODIS has 36 spectral bands, covering the spectral range from 412 nm to 14 200 nm, and provides spatial resolutions of 0.25 km (two bands), 0.5 km (five bands) and 1 km (29 bands) at nadir. The key on-board calibrators (OBCs) include a solar diffuser (SD) and a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) system for calibration of the reflective solar bands, and a V-grooved flat-panel blackbody (BB) for calibration of the thermal emissive bands. In this paper, we describe the use of OBCs for the sensor's radiometric calibration and characterization and discuss on-orbit performance. In addition, we provide an assessment of the on-orbit degradation of the SD and MODIS optics."
flat earth,"Major, trace, and rare earth element (REE) studies have been conducted on the Proterozoic clastic rocks of the Kerur Formation of the Kaladgi-Badami Basin, South India, to determine their paleoweathering conditions and provenance characteristics. Geochemically, these sedimentary rocks are classified as quartz arenite, arkose, litharenite, and sublitharenite. The chemical index of alteration values and the A-CN-K diagram suggest that the clastics rocks in this study underwent moderate to intensive weathering. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns with light REE enrichment, flat heavy REE, and a negative Eu anomaly also attribute felsic source-rock to sedimentary rocks of the Kerur Formation. In addition, Eu/Eu* (~0.77), (La/Lu)cn (~7.65), La/Sc (~5.39), Th/Sc (~3.49 ), La/Co (~6.79), and Cr/Th (~0.31) ratios support a felsic source for these rock types. Comparing REE patterns and Eu anomalies of the source rocks reveals that the Kerur Formation clastic rocks received a major contribution of sediments from the Dharwar Craton."
flat earth,"Summary 
 
Lithospheric-scale controlled-source seismic experiments are most often evaluated by modelling schemes that assume a flat Earth. The practice of modelling the Earth as flat to analyse such data continues because of the simplicity of the parametrization and the relative insignificance of the systematic error introduced by the approximation in many seismic surveys. Significant systematic errors introduced in larger-scale experiments can be compensated for by the application of the Earth-flattening transform; however, this compensation is not accurate when significant lateral velocity contrasts are present. To remedy this, a widely used ray-theoretical traveltime inversion routine has been modified such that rays are traced through a cylindrical coordinate system rather than a Cartesian coordinate system. Synthetic examples are presented to emphasize: (1) the nature of the systematic error present in a model if the Earth's curvature is ignored and (2) the systematic errors that remain if only the 1-D Earth-flattening transform is used to compensate for the Earth's curvature. The enhanced routine presented here improves 2-D interpretations without the need to apply approximations from the Earth-flattening transformation. Seismic refraction surveys greater than ∼350 km in length should use this new method."
flat earth,"Abstract The orography representation in spectral models has always led to problems. These problems become critical in high-resolution models, like the variable-resolution spectral model used at Meteo-France, because they interact with the physical fields. The author describes a variational process to compute a spectral approximation of a gridpoint field. The method is used to improve the representation of the earth topography, and it is compared to a simple spectral filter. The author presents first, in the variable-resolution model, some unsuccessful attempts to show that it is not easy to find the more relevant cost function and then describes the best results obtained. In the variable-resolution case, Gibbs waves are eliminated from the high-resolution area. In the constant-resolution model, Gibbs waves are eliminated from all of the flat areas. In the two cases, the improvement of the orography representation is better with the variational process than with the spectral fitter."

 An earth-flattening transformation is developed for wave-propagation problems that can be formulated in terms of uncoupled scalar Helmholtz equations. Through the transformation, wave problems in isotropic, spherically symmetric media with a specified radial heterogeneity can be expressed in terms of a flat geometry with a suitably vertical heterogeneity. The transformation is exact for homogeneous (no source) problems and is useful for normal mode studies. When a point source of waves is present, the earth-flattening transformation together with the Watson transform converts the reflected wave field from a sum over discrete, spherical eigenfunctions to an integral over continuous wave numbers in a flat geometry. The far-field form of this integral shares many properties with the Weyl integral and is useful for body-wave studies in a spherical earth."
flat earth,"Geologic and geophysical observations indicate that the thickness, density, and strength of the lithosphere vary on the Earth. However, the role of the overriding plate lithosphere properties on the evolution and morphology of subduction is not well understood. This paper presents time‐dependent numerical models of subduction that vary the overriding plate thickness, strength, and density and allow for a plate interface that evolves with time via an anisotropic brittle failure rheology. We examine the effect of these parameters on subduction evolution, in particular, the emergence of (a) asymmetric versus symmetric subduction, (b) trench retreat versus advance, (c) subduction zone geometry, (d) slab stagnation versus penetration into the lower mantle, and (e) flat slab subduction. Almost all of the models presented result in sustained asymmetric subduction from initiation. Trench advance occurs in models with a thick and or strong overriding plate. Slab dip, measured at a depth below the plate boundary interface, has a negative correlation with an increase in overriding plate thickness. Overriding plate thickness exerts a first‐order control over slab penetration into the lower mantle, with penetration most commonly occurring in models with a thick overriding plate. Periods of flat slab subduction occur with thick, strong overriding plates producing strong plate boundary interface coupling. The results provide insight into how the overriding plate plays a role in establishing advancing and retreating subduction as well as providing an explanation for the variation of slab geometry across subduction zones on Earth, where similar patterns of evolution are observed."
flat earth,"Radio-wave transmission over the surface of the Earth is a subject of enquiry going back to the beginning of the century. In this review, an attempt is made to describe the ground-wave mechanism that is omni-present. We first call attention to the early analytical contributions of Zenneck and Sommerfeld, based on a flat-Earth model. The subsequent controversies, particularly with regard to the role of the Zenneck surface wave, are outlined. Further developments by other pioneers, such as van der Pol, Fock, Bremmer, Norton, and Millington, are reviewed, and an attempt is made to put these in a modern context. We also show that the trapped surface wave can be a significant contribution to the total ground-wave field, when the Earth boundary is sufficiently inductive. Mixed-path theory and confirming model tests by Ray King are described briefly, along with calculated propagation curves for twoand three-section paths. The bibliography includes references to related topics, such as tropospheric refraction and topographic influences."
flat earth,"Abstract The tectonic history and time of closure of the Palaeo-Asian ocean of the Altaids are issues of lively current debate. To address these issues, this paper presents detailed geological, petrological and geochemical data of the Liuyuan complex (LC) in the Beishan region in NW China, located in the southernmost Altaids, in order to constrain its age, origin and tectonic setting. The LC mainly comprises massive basalts, pillow basalts, basaltic breccias, gabbros and ultramafic rocks together with cherts and tuffs. Most prominent are gabbros and large volumes of basaltic lavas. These mafic rocks have high TiO2 contents, flat rare earth element (REE) patterns and show high-field-strength elements (HFSEs) similar to those of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). The mafic rocks exhibit positive εNd(t) (6.6–9.0) values, representing magmas derived from the mantle. But these basic rocks are also enriched in Th relative to REEs, and are systematically depleted in Nb–Ta–(Ti) relative to REEs. There is also a large range in initial 87Sr/86Sr (0.7037–0.7093). All these variables indicate that mantle-derived magma was contaminated by fluids and/or melts from a subducting lithospheric slab, and formed in a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) setting. A gabbro intruded in the complex was dated by LA-ICP-MS on 20 zircons that yielded a 206Pb–238U weighted average age of 286 ± 2 Ma. Considering the fact that all these basalts are imbricated against Permian tuffaceous sediments and limestone, we propose that the LC formed as an ophiolite in a fore-arc in Carboniferous–Permian time. This indicates that the Palaeo-Asian ocean still existed at 286 ± 2 Ma in early Permian time, and thus the time of closure of the Palaeo-Asian ocean was in or after the late Permian."
flat earth,"Coesite‐bearing eclogites from >100 km2 in the southern Dulan area, North Qaidam Mountains (NQM) of western China, contain zircon that records protolith crystallization and ultra high pressure (UHP) metamorphism. Sensitive High‐Resolution Ion Microprobe (Mass Spectrometer) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry U–Pb analyses from cathodoluminescence (CL)‐dark zircon cores in a coesite‐bearing eclogite yield an upper intercept age of 838 ± 50 Ma, and oscillatory zoned cores in a kyanite‐bearing eclogite gave a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 832 ± 20 Ma. These zircon cores yield steep heavy rare earth element (HREE) slopes and negative Eu anomalies that suggest a magmatic origin. Thus, c. 835 Ma is interpreted as the eclogite protolith age. Unzoned CL‐grey or ‐bright zircon and zircon rims from four samples yield weighted mean ages of 430 ± 4, 438 ± 2, 446 ± 10 and 446 ± 3 Ma, flat HREE patterns without Eu anomalies, and contain inclusions of garnet, omphacite, rutile, phengite and rare coesite. These ages are interpreted to record 16 ± 5 Myr of UHP metamorphism. These new UHP ages overlap the age range of both eclogite and paragneiss from the northern Dulan area, suggesting that all UHP rock types in the Dulan area belong to the same tectonic unit. Our results are consistent with slow continental subduction, but do not match oceanic subduction and diapiric exhumation UHP model predictions. These new data suggest that, similar to eclogites in other HP/UHP units of the NQM and South Altyn Tagh, protoliths of the eclogites in the Dulan area formed in a continental setting during the Neoproterozoic, and then subducted to mantle depth together with continental materials during the Early Palaeozoic."
flat earth,"Multiple-aperture synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (MAI) enables the measurement of along-track surface deformations by means of split-beam SAR processing. This paper examines the effects of flat-Earth and topographic phases on the MAI phase and derives formulas to correct them. Detailed MAI processing steps are introduced and discussed with particular consideration given to coherence improvement, as well as to computational efficiency. Forward- and backward-looking MAI pairs have different perpendicular baselines, which play a key role in phase distortion; consequently, an orbital deviation of only a few centimeters could result in a significant flat-Earth phase. A second-order polynomial model was used to estimate the perpendicular baseline difference. European Remote Sensing 2 satellite SAR data sets of the Hector Mine earthquake event in 1999 were used for performance evaluation. The proposed processing with the flat-Earth and topographic phase corrections achieved precision of along-track deformation ranging from 10.2 to 13.1 cm. Two coseismic pairs were compared and the standard deviation of the difference between the two independent measurements was 7.0 cm, with a mean difference of -0.24 cm. Thus, the measurement accuracy of MAI was improved using flat-Earth correction and coherence enhancement."
flat earth,"In a layered spherical earth, we take inhomogeneity in each shell such that the solutions of equation of motion are obtained in terms of exponential functions. In this case, the propagator matrix becomes similar to that in a flat earth. We call such transformation as ‘exact flattening transformation’. This transformation allows us to study wave propagation using the rich algorithms of a flat earth and to achieve similar accuracy and efficiency as in a flat earth. Here we generate synthetic seismograms in a spherical earth through exact flattening transformation using the corresponding computer code of a flat layered earth. Comparison of vertical, radial and transverse components of waveforms with approximate flattening transformation has been made for epicentral distances between 20 deg and 60 deg; comparisons show that the body waves fairly agree in both transformations but disagree mainly in Rayleigh wave part; the disagreement increases with the increase of epicentral distance."

It is shown that reflections are indeed small but some interesting and possibly significant exceptions may occur at highly oblique incidence. In fact, total reflection may take place for night-to-day transmission at angles within several degrees of grazing. The same analytical model is also relevant to oblique transmission across a flat lying coast line. >"
flat earth,"Lion roars are low‐frequency (∼100 Hz) whistler waves frequently observed in the Earth's magnetosheath. By analyzing both wave and electron data from the Cluster spacecraft, and comparing with linear Vlasov kinetic theory, Masood et al. (2006) investigated the underlying cause of the lion roar generation. However, the analysis based upon the bi‐Maxwellian distribution function did not adequately explain the observations qualitatively as well as quantitatively. This outstanding problem is revisited in the present paper, and a resolution is put forth in which, the flat‐top non‐Maxwellian distribution function with a velocity power law energetic tail, known as the (r,q) distribution, or the generalized kappa distribution is employed. Upon carrying out the linear stability analysis of the (r,q) distribution against the whistler wave perturbation, and upon comparison with the Cluster data, good qualitative and quantitative agreements are found between theory and data."

flat earth,"Tidal flats, which are non-vegetated land–sea transition areas, have an important ecological function in the global ecosystem. However, they have been shrinking in recent years due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Although many studies focus on tidal flats in the Yangtze River estuary (YRE) in China, how reclamation and plant invasion affect the expansion and erosion of tidal flats are still unclear. In this study, we analyzed all of the available Landsat TM/ETM+ /OLI imagery from the period 1996 to 2018 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to obtain annual maps of coastal tidal flats of YRE at 30 m spatial resolution. We chose three sample tidal flats where severe Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) invasion, reclamation, and control areas existed to explore the joint impact of plant invasion and reclamation on tidal flats. We also point out the main driving factor of tidal flat expansion of each island in YRE by multiple linear regression. Our results suggest that the tidal flats of YRE had obvious expansion from 1996 to 2018, and the speed of expansion is getting slower because of the decreasing deposits in the Yangtze River. Invasive S. alterniflora is effective at promoting silting, and tidal flats with S. alterniflora invasion expanded 2.54 times faster than the control group. Chongming and Hengsha Islands were mainly affected by sediment concentration, while Changxing and Jiuduansha Islands were affected by reclamation and S. alterniflora invasion, respectively. The results could be used to support coastal zone management and biodiversity conservation of the YRE."
flat earth,"Position calculations, e.g. adding, subtracting, interpolating, and averaging positions, depend on the representation used, both with respect to simplicity of the written code and accuracy of the result. The latitude/longitude representation is widely used, but near the pole singularities, this representation has several complex properties, such as error in latitude leading to error in longitude. Longitude also has a discontinuity at ±180°. These properties may lead to large errors in many standard algorithms. Using an ellipsoidal Earth model also makes latitude/longitude calculations complex or approximate. Other common representations of horizontal position include UTM and local Cartesian ‘flat Earth’ approximations, but these usually only give approximate answers, and are complex to use over larger distances. The normal vector to the Earth ellipsoid (called n -vector) is a non-singular position representation that turns out to be very convenient for practical position calculations. This paper presents this representation, and compares it with other alternatives, showing that n -vector is simpler to use and gives exact answers for all global positions, and all distances, for both ellipsoidal and spherical Earth models. In addition, two functions based on n -vector are presented, that further simplify most practical position calculations, while ensuring full accuracy."

The scrapbook can be used to evaluate the breadth and depth of the students' comprehension of Earth Science concepts. The assignment encourages students to relate course content to the world outside the classroom, and to become aware of the relevance of Earth Science to their daily lives."
flat earth,"The paper is concerned with the concept of surface impedance as applied to the theory of radio-wave propagation over a real, i.e. inhomogeneous and irregular, earth; some of the conclusions may also be of value in the theory of waveguides, cavity resonators and certain types of aerial.The advantages and limitations of the surface-impedance concept are shown in connection with a very general integral equation for the field strength.The approximations and physical phenomena underlying the surface-impedance concept are first discussed in the simplest case of a homogeneous and flat earth. The analysis is then extended to a horizontally stratified earth; it is then possible to characterize the earth by certain effective parameters depending on frequency and the geometric structure of the soil. The same is also true in the cases of a spherical or not too excessively irregular earth. The discussion is then generalized to the case of an arbitrarily inhomogeneous earth. The height/gain function and the shape of the ellipse of polarization are discussed. Approximate boundary conditions for the Hertzian vector and Hertzian scalar function are related to the concept of surface impedance.Practical conclusions are drawn with regard to the existence and measurement of the effective earth constants and to some aspects of geological prospecting by radio methods."
flat earth,"Extensive model studies have been carried out in the past to investigate the effects of ionospheric perturbations on VLF radio propagation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide. In these model studies the surface of the earth is considered flat and the ionosphere is characterized by a finite surface impedance of variable effective height. However, the restrictions for the flat-earth model are not satisfied for modes of near-grazing incidence. 
 
As shown before by Wait, a planar structure that supports the desired modes may be constructed simply by modifying the medium of propagation in the straight rectangular dual-model waveguide. 
 
As a result of including the earth's curvature in the model, the analysis yields an explanation for the relatively large undulations in the electric field observed at the surface of the earth. 
 
The larger undulations in the “curved” model are a result of both the modification of the characteristic functions and a larger scattering coefficient."
flat earth,"Abstract The problem of relating satellite measurements from wide field-of-view (WFOV) radiometers to the radiant exitance emitted from the top of the atmosphere is treated. The problem is formulated as an integral equation to be solved for the radiant exitance distribution in terms of the measurements. An analytical solution to this integral equation in terms of spherical harmonies is presented for the case in which the directional dependence of the outgoing radiation is a function of zenith angle only. It is shown that the resolution which can be obtained under real conditions is limited. The sensitivity of the derived radiant exitance distribution to the directional dependence of the out-going radiation is studied, and results are presented for WFOV flat-plate and spherical radiometers and for restricted field-of-view flat-plate radiometers. It is demonstrated that this sensitivity is a function of the scale of spatial resolution; thus higher resolutions in the radiant exitance distribution are more se..."
flat earth,"We measured the oxidation rates of thin samarium, gadolinium, ytterbium, and yttrium films at room temperature in air by a simple optical transmission technique to help understand how to produce flat 100 nm or so thick films on 150‐nm freestanding polymer substrates for use as x‐ray lasers. The validity of the method is established with aluminum, whose oxide layer reaches a limiting thickness of about 5 nm within 1 h. The oxidation kinetics of different rare earths follow different rate laws. Ytterbium and gadolinium are best described by an inverse logarithmic rate law, yttrium by a direct logarithmic rate law, and samarium by a parabolic rate law. After 2 months, the oxide thicknesses of Y, Yb, Gd, and Sm are about 5, 9, 15, and 17 nm, respectively. Only Sm continues to oxidize rapidly, reaching 35 nm in 6.5 months. Spectroscopic results on Eu and Gd are consistent with previous results that the oxidized layer on the rare earths is usually a carbonated hydroxide. The results of our measurements are comp..."
flat earth,"The concept of a spherical Earth and the implications of that fact are well-represented in the AAAS Project 2061 Science for all Americans report and the difficulty of teaching it has been documented by Nussbaum, Vosniadou and Brewer [3,4]. The concept of a round Earth is not a simple one for children to acquire. Their everyday experience reinforces their deeply held notion that the Earth is flat. More precisely, their mental model of the world separates `sky' and `earth' into two parallel layers, one `above' the other; the two directions `up' and `down' are absolute. Telling young children that the Earth is round does not cause their intuitive model to be replaced by a spherical conception of the Earth. Instead children assimilate the new information into their prior knowledge and often conclude that the earth is flat and circular."
flat earth,"To analyze ELF wave propagation in the earth-ionosphere cavity, a flat earth approximation may be derived from the exact equations, which are applicable to the spherical cavity, by introducing a second-order or Debye approximation for the spherical Hankel functions. In the frequency range 3 to 30 Hz, however, the assumed conditions for the Debye approximation are not satisfied. For this reason an exact evaluation of the spherical Hankel functions is used to study the effects of the flat earth approximation on various propagation and resonance parameters. By comparing the resonance equation for a spherical cavity with its flat earth counterpart and by assuming that the surface impedance Z/sub i/ at the upper cavity boundary is known, the relation between the eigenvalue ..nu.. and S/sub v/, the sine of the complex angle of incidence at the lower ionosphere boundary, is established as ..nu..(..nu.. + 1) = (kaS/sub v/)/sup 2/. It is also shown that the approximation ..nu..(..nu.. + 1) approximately equals (..nu.. + 1/2)/sup 2/ which was used by some authors is not adequate below 30 Hz. Numerical results for both spherical and planar stratification show that (1) planar stratification is adequate for the computation of the lowest three ELF resonancemore » frequencies to within 0.1 Hz; (2) planar stratification will lead to errors in cavity Q and wave attenuation which increase with frequency; (3) computation of resonance frequencies to within 0.1 Hz requires the extension of the lower boundary of the ionosphere to a height where the ratio of conduction current to displacement current, (sigma/..omega..epsilon/sub 0/), is less than 0.3; (4) atmospheric conductivity should be considered down to ground level in computing cavity Q and wave attenuation.« less"

Measurements were taken from three transmitting evolved node base stations (eNodeBs) located along three major routes in Lagos Nigeria, at an operating frequency of 1800MHz.Measured pathloss was comparatively analyzed with respect to predictions made by free space, flat earth, Okumura-Hata, Walfisch-Ikegami, Ericsson, ECC-33, and Lee models. Results showed that the free space, flat earth, Walfisch-Ikegami, ECC-33, Ericsson, and Lee models over predict the path loss along the tested routes with root mean square errors (RMSEs) relatively higher than the specified range. The Okumura-Hata model showed the best performance with RMSEs of 7.42dB, 7.63dB and 9.64dB along the investigated routes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This model was modified using the least square method in order to enhance its signal prediction accuracy. The modified Okumura-Hata model predicted the path loss along routes 1, 2, and 3, with RMSEs of 5.20dB, 4.89dB and 8.78dB, respectively. Overall, the modified Okumura-Hata model showed lower RMSEs closer to zero which are acceptable. This model could find very useful applications in the area of quality signal prediction and pathloss modeling for related wireless mobile environments.

In particular, for earthquake site studies or shallow environmental investigations the surface of the earth may have a significant impact on the outcome of simulations. Computations based on several elastic/viscoelastic flat horizontal free-surface conditions are compared and benchmarked against an analytical solution. An accurate and simple condition is found and then generalized to allow for irregular free surfaces.

flat earth,"There has been geographical variation in sea level since rapid postglacial melting of polar ice ceased similar to 6 k.y. ago, reflecting isostatic adjustments of Earth and ocean surfaces to past (and ongoing) redistribution of ice and water loads. A new data set of over 100 fossil microatolls from Christmas (Kiritimati) Island provides a Holocene sea-level record of unparalleled continuity. Living reef-flat corals grow up to a low-tide level. Adjacent fossil microatolls, long-lived Porites corals up to several meters in diameter, occur at similar elevations (±0.1 m), and extensive fossil microatolls in the island interior are at consistent elevations within each population. Collectively, they comprise an almost continuous sequence spanning the past 5 k.y., indicating that, locally, sea level has been within 0.25 m of its present position, and precluding global sea-level oscillations of one or more meters inferred from less stable locations, or using other sea-level indicators. This mid-Pacific atoll is tectonically stable and far from former ice sheets. The precisely surveyed and radiometrically dated microatolls indicate that sea level has not experienced significant oscillations, in accordance with geophysical modeling, which implies that the eustatic contribution from past ice melt and the isostatic adjustment of the ocean floor to loading largely cancel each other at this site."
flat earth,"The Chingiz–Tarbagatai megazone is a well-known early Palaeozoic unit in eastern Kazakhstan that extends into northern West Junggar along the Tarbagatai–Xiemisitai–Sharbuti Mountains. Here, we report new geochronological and geochemical data for the Chagantaolegai ophiolite, discovered in the south Xiemisitai Mountains, north of the Heshituoluogai Valley in West Junggar. The laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry zircon U–Pb ages of a gabbro in the Chagantaolegai ophiolite are 517 ± 3 and 519 ± 3 Ma, corresponding to the early to middle Cambrian. Serpentinized peridotites in the ophiolite show low rare earth element (REE) abundances (0.61–0.94 μg/g) and slight loss of middle REEs. Chagantaolegai metagabbro samples have flat to very slightly depleted patterns in light REEs, with a narrow range of REE abundances. The Chagantaolegai spilites and metagabbros display similar flat patterns, which show a geochemical signature similar to mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) between Yb and Zr, and diverge from MORB towards the most incompatible elements in MORB-normalized multi-element diagrams. The Th/Yb vs. Nb/Yb diagram for the spilite samples also suggests a mid-ocean ridge (MOR) setting. To summarize, all the geochemical characteristics of the Chagantaolegai ophiolite point to MOR ophiolite. The positive εNd(t) values (0.78 to +9.85) suggest that the gabbros and spilites were derived from a depleted mantle source with chemical inhomogeneity. The Chagantaolegai ophiolite spatiotemporal characteristics correlate well with the Kujibai and Hongguleleng ophiolites in the northern part of West Junggar, and the Zhaur and Balkybek ophiolites in eastern Kazakhstan. These data show that early Palaeozoic oceanic crust started to develop in the early to middle Cambrian in northern West Junggar. Stratigraphic correlations also suggest that the South Saur Fault and an inferred fault buried in the Heshituoluogai depression are the northern and southern boundary of the Chingiz–Tarbagatai megazone, respectively."
flat earth,"This paper investigates the potential of low‐cost spaceborne data to approximate longitudinal surface profiles during flood events on large rivers. In February 2000, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) measured the elevation of most of the Earth's surface with spatially continuous sampling and an absolute vertical accuracy between 5.6 and 9 m. The vertical error has been shown to change with topographic complexity, being less important over flat terrain. This allows water surface slopes to be measured and associated discharge volumes to be estimated for open channels in large basins, such as the Amazon. Building on these capabilities, this paper demonstrates that near real‐time coarse resolution radar imagery of a recent flood event on a 98 km reach of the River Po (Italy) combined with SRTM terrain height data leads to a water slope remarkably similar to that derived by combining the radar image with highly accurate airborne laser altimetry. Moreover, it is shown that this spaceborne flood wave approximation compares well to a hydraulic model and thus allows the performance of the latter, calibrated on a previous event, to be assessed when applied to an event of different magnitude in near real time. These results are not only of great importance to real‐time flood management and flood forecasting but also support the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission that will routinely provide water levels and slopes with higher precision around the globe."

Effectiveness of treatments was tested against the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.); the granary weevil, Sitophilus granarius (L.); the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.); the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Jacquelin duVal; the saw-toothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus, surinamensis (L.); and the flat grain beetle, Cryptolestes pusillus (Schonherr).

Tests were made under constant conditions of 80° ± 1° F. and 60% ± 5% relative humidity. Untreated control samples of wheat were completely riddled by the end of 6 months after initial exposure to insects. Results show that 4 Ibs. of diatomaceous earth per ton or grain would prevent infestations for 6 months, and 6 1bs. per ton would last 9 months. The 8-lbs.-per ton treatment was still effective when the experiment was terminated 12 months after initial exposure to insects. The results indicate that diatomaceous earth offers promise as a means of protecting seeds against insects, and it was concluded that more extensive trials should be undertaken with this material."
flat earth,"One of the most widely recognized parameters in solid-earth geophysics is the assumed density of the surface rocks of the continental crust, 2.67 g/cm 3 , or 2670 kg/m 3 in today9s preferred SI units. In the calculation of Bouguer and isostatic gravity anomalies, which are widely used for geological studies, the gravitational effect of the earth mass between an observation site and a datum is calculated assuming an infinite, flat slab of a specified density that approximates the mass. The datum for most surveys is sea level or, in the case of surveys of limited areas, it may be the elevation of the lowest station in the survey. Although the choice of datum is arbitrary, commonly sea level is used in an attempt to standardize anomalies from different surveys. Similarly, a density of 2.67 g/cm 3 is generally assumed for the density of the included mass in regional gravity surveys."
flat earth,"The problem of the radiation from a horizontal antenna at low radio frequencies over a spherical earth is discussed. The solution is facilitated by considering that the surface of the earth can be characterized by a boundary impedance. It is shown that, in general, both vertically and horizontally polarized waves are radiated along the surface of the earth. At short distances for a homogeneous earth, the expressions are in agreement with Norton's formulas for the radiation field of a horizontal dipole over a flat earth."
flat earth,"We construct models of the structural evolution of super-Earth- and mini-Neptune-type exoplanets with H2–He envelopes, incorporating radiative cooling and XUV-driven mass loss. We conduct a parameter study of these models, focusing on initial mass, radius, and envelope mass fractions, as well as orbital distance, metallicity, and the specific prescription for mass loss. From these calculations, we investigate how the observed masses and radii of exoplanets today relate to the distribution of their initial conditions. Orbital distance and the initial envelope mass fraction are the most important factors determining planetary evolution, particularly radius evolution. Initial mass also becomes important below a “turnoff mass,” which varies with orbital distance, with mass–radius curves being approximately flat for higher masses. Initial radius is the least important parameter we study, with very little difference between the hot start and cold start limits after an age of 100 Myr. Model sets with no mass loss fail to produce results consistent with observations, but a plausible range of mass-loss scenarios is allowed. In addition, we present scenarios for the formation of the Kepler-11 planets. Our best fit to observations of Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c involves formation beyond the snow line, after which they moved inward, circularized, and underwent a reduced degree of mass loss."
flat earth,"The reduced gravity experienced in lunar or Martian surfaces can be simulated on the earth using a cable-driven system, where the cable lifts a person to reduce his or her weight. This paper presents a novel cable-driven system designed for the purpose. It is integrated with a head-mounted display and a motion capture system. Focusing on jump motion within the system, this paper proposes to scale the jump and reports the experiments made for quantifying the extent to which a jump can be scaled without the discrepancy between physical and virtual jumps being noticed by the user. With the tolerable range of scaling computed from these experiments, an application named retargeted jump is developed, where a user can jump up onto virtual objects while physically jumping in the real-world flat floor. The core techniques presented in this paper can be extended to develop extreme-sport simulators such as parasailing and skydiving."
flat earth,"The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat 8 was tasked with continuing thermal band measurements of Earth as part of the Landsat program. From first light in early 2013, there were obvious indications, such as nonuniform banding and varying absolute calibration errors, that stray light was contaminating the thermal image data collected from the instrument. Stray light in this case refers to unwanted radiance from outside the field-of-view entering the optical system and being recorded by the focal plane. Standard calibration techniques used to flat-field and radiometrically correct the data were not sufficient to adjust the image products to within the accuracy that the Landsat community has come to expect. The development of an operational technique to remove the effects of the stray light in the TIRS data has become a high priority. A methodology is presented that makes use of a stray light optical model developed for the instrument along with knowledge of the out-of-field area surrounding the TIRS earth scene. Two versions of the algorithm are proposed in which one method utilizes near-coincident image data from an external sensor while another novel method is proposed that makes use of TIRS image data itself without the need for external data. Preliminary results of the algorithm indicate that banding artifacts due to stray light are significantly reduced when the methods are applied. Additionally, initial absolute calibration error estimates of over 9K are reduced to within 2K when applying the correction methods. Although both variations of the proposed algorithm have significantly reduced the stray light effects, the fact that the latter method utilizing TIRS image data itself does not rely on any external data is a significant advantage toward the development of an operational stray light correction solution. Ongoing work is focused on operationalizing the algorithm and identifying and quantifying potential sources of error when applying the method."
flat earth,"Abstract. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is an established method for the detection and monitoring of earth surface processes. This approach has been most successful where the observed area fulfills specific requirements, such as sufficient backscattering, flat slope gradients or very slow changes of vegetation. We investigated the capability of two different InSAR techniques and achieved good results for the recognition of landslides in China and Greece that compared well with geodetic derived movement rates. This demonstrates the strong potential of SAR Interferometry for the detection of landslides and earth surface movements."

 We solve the equations of P-SV motion in a transversely isotropic non-gravitating spherical shell with elastic parameters being proportional to rp and density being proportional to rp−2, where p is an arbitrary constant and r is the radial distance from the center of the Earth. The solutions are obtained in terms of exponential functions. The expression for the displacement-stress matrix becomes similar to that used in an isotropic flat-layered Earth. Thus, the existing formulations of this isotropic flat Earth can be used to study wave propagation in a transversely istropic spherical-layered Earth. As an example, one of the existing formulations of the isotropic flat Earth has been used successfully to find phase velocity and eigenfunctions of Rayleigh wave in a transversely isotropic spherical Earth."
flat earth,"Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses of U–Pb isotopes and trace elements in zircon and titanite were carried out on epoxy mounts and thin sections for ultrahigh‐pressure (UHP) eclogite in association with paragneiss in the Dabie orogen. The results provide a direct link between metamorphic ages and temperatures during continental subduction‐zone metamorphism. Zircon U–Pb dating gives two groups of concordant ages at 242 ± 2 to 239 ± 5 Ma and 226 ± 2 to 224 ± 6 Ma, respectively. The Triassic zircon U–Pb ages are characterized by flat heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns typical of metamorphic growth. Ti‐in‐zircon thermometry for the two generations of metamorphic zircon yields temperatures of 697 ± 27 to 721 ± 8 °C and 742 ± 19 to 778 ± 34 °C, respectively. We interpret that the first episode of zircon growth took place during subduction prior to the onset of UHP metamorphism, whereas the second episode in the stage of exhumation from UHP to HP eclogite facies regime. Thus, the continental subduction‐zone metamorphism of sedimentary protolith is temporally associated with two episodes of fluid activity, respectively, predating and postdating the UHP metamorphic phase. The significantly high Ti‐in‐zircon temperatures for the younger zircon at lower pressures indicate the initial ‘hot’ exhumation after the peak UHP metamorphism. There are two types of titanite. One exhibits light rare earth element (LREE) enrichment, steep MREE–HREE patterns and no Eu anomalies, and yields Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures of 551 to 605 °C at 0.5 GPa, and the other shows LREE depletion and flat MREE–HREE patterns, and gives Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures of 782–788 °C at 2.0 GPa. The former is amenable for U–Pb dating, yielding a discordia lower intercept age of 252 ± 3 Ma. Thus, the first type of titanite is interpreted to have grown in the absence of garnet and plagioclase and thus in the early stage of subduction. In contrast, the second one occurs as rims surrounding rutile cores and thus grew in the presence of garnet during the ‘hot’ exhumation. Therefore, there is multistage growth of zircon and titanite during the continental subduction‐zone metamorphism. The combined studies of chronometry and thermobarometry provide tight constraints on the P–T–t path of eclogites during the continental collision. It appears that the mid‐T/UHP eclogite facies zone would not only form by subduction of the continental crust in a P–T path slightly below the wet granite solidus, but also experience decompression heating during the initial exhumation."
flat earth,"An expression is derived for the gravity anomaly at an external point caused by a horizontal lamina with the boundary of an irregular polygon. This expression is put in a form suitable for computation by a high speed digital computer. By making the number of sides of the polygon sufficiently large, any irregular outline can be closely approximated. Any three dimensional body can be represented by contours. By replacing each contour by a polygonal lamina, the anomaly caused by it can be obtained at any external point. By a system of interpolation between contours combined with a numerical integration the gravity anomaly caused by the three‐dimensional body can be calculated to a high degree of precision. This method may also be used for rapidly computing terrain corrections on a flat earth. By making a small modification it can further be adopted for computing the terrain correction as well as local isostatic compensation on the Airy system up to the external radius of Hayford zone O on a spherical earth. ..."

In effect, this system was a sort of scientific version of the traditional poetic picture of the world in which a round, flat earth was surmounted by the dome of heaven wreathed with ""signs"" and had beneath it first Hades, then Tartarus, with gates, a bronze threshold at the top, a bronze fence round it, about its ""neck"" a triple coil of night, and a floor which was as far beneath earth as earth was beneath heaven., The Parmenidean rationalisation of poetry is in strong contrast to the more strictly mnaterialistic picture of the Ionian Greeks, according to which the world was either like a log of wood floating on water (Thales) 2, or like a cylindrical drum three times as broad as it was deep (Anaximander) 3, or like a lid floating upon air (Anaximenes Anaxagoras, Democritus) 4, and in which the poetical concept of Hades and Tartarus, so necessary to those preoccupied with rewards and punishments in an after life but quite unnecessary to those who were not, had been totally eliminated. I considered the Parmenidean picture in connexion with the general account of t& i'7ra yiq and the image of whorls given in the myth of Er in the Republic.

As such the global South is everywhere, but always also somewhere: accountable, embodied, and highly heterogeneous. It interrupts the flat earth, borderless world, and smooth space conceits of globalists, highlighting asymmetry and inequality amidst intensifying global interdependency. At the same time, it displaces the divide and dispossess discourses of both liberals and neoliberals alike, articulating earlier critical geographies of a non-aligned Third World with new struggles against dispossession on a global scale."
flat earth,"We studied oceanic mafic igneous rocks of the Mesozoic Banggongco–Nujang suture zone in western Tibet to constrain the tectonic evolution of these rocks and the region as a whole. Two transects were accomplished. Seven basalt samples from the base of the Nadongshan transect (N1 basalts) have flat chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) and primitive-mantle-normalized trace element variation diagrams that are similar to MORB. Two basalt samples from the base of the Nadongshan transect (N1 basalts), ten gabbro samples from the middle of Nadongshan transect (N2 gabbros), four basalt samples from the bottom of Tanjiuxiama transect (T1 basalts), and four basalt samples from the top of the Tanjiuxiama transect (T2 basalts) are alkali basalts and have light rare earth element (LREE)-enriched chondrite-normalized REE patterns, and have primitive-mantle-normalized trace element variation diagrams that are enriched in highly incompatible elements, similar to OIB. LREE concentrations increase from N1 basalts to the T1 and T2 basalts, which have (La/Yb)N up to 16 and have even higher (Ce/Sm)N. These data indicate that the Nadong ocean island is an Azores-type ocean island that formed during the mature stage of development of the Banggongco–Nujiang Ocean. The conformable nature of the Nadong ocean island with the Mugagangri Group flysch indicates that the Banggongco–Nujiang Ocean was never a large ocean."
flat earth,"The viscosity structure of Earth's mantle, even the 1‐D radial viscosity profile, remains not well constrained. The dynamics of the subducting slabs is strongly affected by, and can be used to constrain, the viscosity structure of the mantle. Here, we perform fully dynamic, self‐consistent mantle convection models to study the dynamics of subducted slabs in the deep mantle. We use a statistical analysis approach to quantify how the depth distribution of flat‐lying slabs is affected by the depth‐dependence of mantle viscosity. We find that, for cases in which the viscosity increases at 660 km depth, whether sharply or gradually, flat‐lying slabs preferentially occur above this depth, and importantly, up to ∼30% of the subducted slabs previously flatted at this depth later sink to the deep lower mantle and maintain a flat‐lying morphology. The frequency of (or the probability to have) flat‐lying slabs at ∼1,000 km depth in these cases is similar to cases in which the viscosity jump occurs at 1,000 km depth. Therefore, to explain the presence of flat‐lying slabs at ∼1,000 km depth for the Earth does not require a viscosity jump at this depth. In contrast, a viscosity jump merely occurring at ∼1,000 km depth causes a lack of flat‐lying slabs in the uppermost lower mantle at ∼700–900 km depth and is inconsistent with seismic observations. The presence of flat‐lying slab materials in the Earth's uppermost lower mantle requires a viscosity increase at 660 km depth."
flat earth,"A six degree-of-freedom, flat-earth dynamics, non-linear, and non-proprietary aircraft simulation was developed that is representative of a generic mid-sized twin-jet transport aircraft. The simulation was developed from a non-proprietary, publicly available, subscale twin-jet transport aircraft simulation using scaling relationships and a modified aerodynamic database. The simulation has an extended aerodynamics database with aero data outside the normal transport-operating envelope (large angle-of-attack and sideslip values). The simulation has representative transport aircraft surface actuator models with variable rate-limits and generally fixed position limits. The simulation contains a generic 40,000 lb sea level thrust engine model. The engine model is a first order dynamic model with a variable time constant that changes according to simulation conditions. The simulation provides a means for interfacing a flight control system to use the simulation sensor variables and to command the surface actuators and throttle position of the engine model."
flat earth,"Abstract. Energy balance models (EBMs) are highly simplified models of the climate system, providing
admissible conceptual tools for understanding climate changes.
The global temperature is calculated by the radiation budget through the incoming energy from the Sun and the outgoing energy from the Earth.
The argument that the temperature can be calculated by this simple radiation budget is revisited.
The underlying assumption for a realistic temperature distribution is explored: one has to assume a moderate diurnal cycle due to the large heat capacity and the fast rotation of the Earth. Interestingly, the global mean in the revised EBM is very close to the originally proposed value.
The main point is that the effective heat capacity and its temporal
variation over the daily and seasonal cycle needs to be taken into account when estimating surface temperature from the energy budget.
Furthermore, the time-dependent EBM predicts a flat meridional temperature gradient for large heat capacities, reducing the seasonal cycle and the outgoing radiation and increasing global temperature.
Motivated by this finding, a sensitivity experiment with a complex model is performed where the vertical diffusion in the ocean has been increased.
The resulting
temperature gradient, reduced seasonal cycle, and global warming is also found in climate reconstructions,
providing a possible mechanism for past climate changes prior to 3 million years ago.

flat earth,": Mineralogical and geochemical analyses of samples collected from piston core HZ11-P01 at the western margin of Lake Hazar were studied to determine the provenance and weathering conditions on the source area together with tectonic setting of the source rocks, paleoclimate of the region, and paleo-redox conditions of the lake sediments. Nonclay minerals in the sediment core are represented by feldspar, quartz, dolomite, and calcite. The clay mineral assemblage consists of smectite/chlorite mixed-layer clay, chlorite, and illite. Most major, trace, and rare earth element contents of the lake samples are generally similar to those of the catchment area. Chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns of the lake samples are characterized by enrichment of light rare earth elements, a relatively flat heavy rare earth element pattern, and no Eu negative anomaly. The chemical index of alteration and index of compositional variability of the core sediment suggested that the intensity of weathering in the source area was low to moderate. The paleoclimatic indicator (C-values) showed that a paleoclimate changing from semiarid to semimoist prevailed during the last ~2 ka BP. Authigenic U and element ratios such as Th/U, Ni/Co, Cu/Zn, V/Cr, Eu/Eu*, and Ce/Ce* indicate that the lake sediments were deposited under oxic conditions. La/Sc, Co/Th, Cr/Th, Zr/Sc, and Th/Sc element ratios in the core sediments are consistent with values of sediments derived from mainly mafic and intermediate source rocks. According to discriminant-function diagrams, lake samples are plotted within the arc setting and arc-continent collision, which is in accordance with the geology of the study area."
flat earth,"Recent studies of the amount of electron heating and of the Shapesof electron velocity distributions across shocks near the earth are reviewed. It is found that electron heating increases with increasing shock strength but is always less than the ion \eatfng. The scale length of ●lectron heating is also less than that for the ions. Electron velocity distributions show characteristic shapes which depend on the strength of the shocks. At the weaker shocks, electron heating is mostly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, i, and results in Gaussian-shaped velocity distrl.butionsar lcw-tomoderate energies. At the stronger shocks, parallel heating predominates resultfng in flat-topped velocity distributions.

flat earth,"Significance Although plate tectonics has seen broad acceptance for Earth, the manner in which lithospheric plates are coupled to Earth’s deeper interior is still heavily debated. In particular, recent seismological observations suggest a sharp, flat base of the lithosphere, whereas thermal models suggest a gradational boundary that deepens with age. Based on laboratory experiments, we suggest that thermal models are most appropriate and that seismic studies are detecting features frozen into the lithosphere after melting at midocean ridges. Experiments on olivine aggregates demonstrate that the seismic characteristics of deforming upper mantle are dramatically different between melt-free and low-melt-fraction aggregates. A model of upper-mantle flow incorporating these results predicts seismological features in excellent agreement with observations beneath the Pacific Ocean basin. Tectonic plates are a key feature of Earth’s structure, and their behavior and dynamics are fundamental drivers in a wide range of large-scale processes. The operation of plate tectonics, in general, depends intimately on the manner in which lithospheric plates couple to the convecting interior. Current debate centers on whether the transition from rigid lithosphere to flowing asthenosphere relates to increases in temperature or to changes in composition such as the presence of a small amount of melt or an increase in water content below a specified depth. Thus, the manner in which the rigid lithosphere couples to the flowing asthenosphere is currently unclear. Here we present results from laboratory-based torsion experiments on olivine aggregates with and without melt, yielding an improved database describing the crystallographic alignment of olivine grains. We combine this database with a flow model for oceanic upper mantle to predict the structure of the seismic anisotropy beneath ocean basins. Agreement between our model and seismological observations supports the view that the base of the lithosphere is thermally controlled. This model additionally supports the idea that discontinuities in velocity and anisotropy, often assumed to be the base of the lithosphere, are, instead, intralithospheric features reflecting a compositional boundary established at midocean ridges, not a rheological boundary."
flat earth,"Lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the northwestern Tarim basin were strongly altered by complicated geofluids, which resulted in the occurrence of various diagenetic minerals (e.g., dolomite). Here, in situ major, trace, and rare earth element geochemistry of Lower Ordovician diagenetic dolomite grains as well as petrography were performed to unravel the geochemical features, the nature, and origin of the diagenetic fluids. The results indicate that different geochemical information can be detected within a single sample, even within a single dolomite grain. Five generations of diagenetic dolomite have been identified based on geochemical signatures, resulting from four distinct types of diagenetic fluids: (1) HREE enrichment (PAAS‐normalized), low ΣREE, no Eu anomaly, low Mn, Ba, moderate Fe, and high Sr contents are probably due to early burial dolomitizing fluids; (2) MREE enrichment, high ΣREE, high Mn, Fe, and low Sr content are likely to be associated with Devonian deep‐circulating crustal hydrothermal fluids; (3) flat or LREE enrichment pattern with obviously positive Eu anomaly is inferred to be linked to Permian magmatic hydrothermal fluids; and (4) flat REE pattern, moderate ΣREE, no Eu anomaly, low Mn, Ba, moderate Fe, and high Sr contents are probably due to late burial dolomitizing fluids. The significances of in situ method demonstrated in this study, compared with the whole rock analysis, include not only contamination‐free analysis but also unraveling the internal geochemical variation within a single sample or a mineral grain. Thus, for the geochemical study of complicated diagenetic process, in situ method should be preferentially considered."
flat earth,"For decades, alluvial plains have been the areas of the fastest population growth over most of the globe. Modern societies demand growing extensions of flat and easily accessible land to accommodate the swelling urban areas, booming industrial districts, large power plants, and multi-runway airports. But how can we tell if such flat areas hide large active faults? How can we assign a significant pre-instrumental earthquake to its causative source? In other words, how can modern societies deal with buried, that is to say, 'invisible' faults, and with the elusiveness of the hazards they can pose? The issue of blind faulting became widely debated in the Earth sciences community in 1989, following the publication of a summary on a sequence of 'hidden earthquakes' that hit central and southern California, USA, between 1983 and 1987, and following the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta, California, earthquake (Mw 6.9). These earthquakes shattered the accepted belief that large earthquakes are associated with large topographic contrasts; i.e., that they usually take place in mountainous terrains, and that their causative faults are expressed at the surface. Stein and Yeats [1989] spelled out clearly that ""...large earthquakes can take place not only on faults that cut the Earth's surface, but also on 'blind' faults under folded terrain"". Due to the growing concentrations of population and infrastructures in low topography areas, although such earthquakes might pose comparable hazards, they can come with substantially greater risk than earthquakes that occur in hilly or mountainous terrains.

flat earth,"Rocks in the earth’s crust usually contain pores and cracks. Typical examples include tight sandstone and shale rocks that have low porosity but contain abundant microcracks. By extending the classic Biot’s poroelastic wave theory to include the effects of cracks, we obtain an elastic wave theory for porous rocks containing cracks, adding crack density and aspect ratio as two important parameters to the original theory. Because the flat- or narrow-shaped cracks can easily deform under acoustic wave excitation, the acoustic property of a cracked porous rock is quite different for different saturation conditions. The predicted fluid sensitivity is used to interpret acoustic velocity log data from tight sand and shale gas formations. In both scenarios, the new theory correctly predicts the trend of velocity variation with gas saturation. The results confirm that the presence of cracks in tight rocks can give rise to significant hydrocarbon signature in the acoustic measurement data, allowing for identifying hydrocarbons from the data."
flat earth,"In this study,we showthat the traditionally defined Bouguer gravity anomaly needs a correction to become 'the no-topography gravity anomaly' and that the isostatic gravity anomaly is better defined by the latter anomaly plus a gravity anomaly compensation effect than by the Bouguer gravity anomaly plus a gravitational compensation effect. This is because only the newisostatic gravity anomaly completely removes and compensates for the topographic effect. F. A. Vening Meinesz' inverse problem in isostasy deals with solving for the Moho depth from the known external gravity field and mean Moho depth (known, e.g. from seismic reflection data) by a regional isostatic compensation using a flat Earth approximation. H. Moritz generalized the problem to that of a global compensation with a spherical mean Earth approximation. The problem can be formulated mathematically as that of solving a non-linear Fredholm integral equation. The solutions to these problems are based on the condition of isostatic balance of the isostatic gravity anomaly, and, theoretically, this assumption cannot be met by the old definition of the isostatic gravity anomaly. We show how the Moho geometry can be solved for the gravity anomaly, gravity disturbance and disturbing potential, etc., and, from a theoretical point of view, all these solutions are the same."
flat earth,"In the Acatlan Complex of southern Mexico, a late Paleozoic assemblage, consisting of a gabbro-diorite-tonalite-trondhjemite suite (Totoltepec pluton) and clastic-calcareous metasedimentary rocks (Tecomate Formation), postdates collisional orogeny that resulted in the amalgamation of Pangea. This region offers a rare opportunity to examine assemblages developed at different crustal levels along the periphery of Pangea at the critical stage between amalgamation and breakup. The Totoltepec pluton consists of minor mafic-ultramafic rocks (306 ± 2 Ma; concordant U-Pb zircon analysis) that are marginal to the main mafic-felsic intrusion (289 ± 2 Ma). Geochemistry of the marginal rocks indicates an arc tholeiitic to calc-alkaline character with high large ion lithophile elements (LILEs)/high field strength elements (HFSEs), flat rare earth element (REE) patterns, and initial ɛ Nd values of +1.3 to +3.3. The younger Totoltepec phase exhibits a calc-alkaline trace-element geochemistry with flat to moderately fractionated light (L) REE–enriched patterns and initial ɛ Nd values of –0.8 to +2.6, which are also consistent with an arc environment. The Sm-Nd isotopic signature is more primitive compared to contemporaneous arc-related igneous rocks in southern Mexico, suggesting the pluton was emplaced in a less mature, outboard part of the arc, and/or along a fault conduit. The Tecomate Formation, as currently defined, is a composite of lithologically similar strata deposited in several fault-bounded basins ranging from Carboniferous to Early Permian in age. To the south of the Totoltepec pluton, the depositional age of the Tecomate Formation is tightly constrained in one section to ca. 300 Ma, but in another section, it is between ca. 288 and ca. 263 Ma. The Tecomate Formation rocks are interpreted to have been derived from a late Paleozoic arc based on (1) arc-related geochemistry, (2) ɛ Nd (t) values ranging from –5.6 to +0.3 (t = 288 Ma) that overlap those of the Totoltepec pluton, and (3) detrital zircons with predominantly Carboniferous–Permian ages. The Totoltepec and Tecomate units in the study area form part of a continental arc extending from Guatemala to California, which necessitates subduction of the paleo-Pacific oceanic lithosphere beneath the western margin of a Pangea-A configuration."

The mission has the goal of generating a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with an accuracy corresponding to the DTED-3 specifications (12 m posting, 2 m relative height accuracy for flat terrain). This goal will be achieved by means of a second, TerraSAR-X like satellite (TanDEM-X) flying in a close orbit configuration with TerraSAR-X.

flat earth,"A new approach to self‐potential (SP) data interpretation for the recognition of a buried causative SP source system is presented. The general model considered is characterized by the presence of primary electric sources or sinks, located within any complex resistivity structure with a flat air‐earth boundary. First, using physical considerations of the nature of the electric potential generated by any arbitrary distribution of primary source charges and the related secondary induced charges over the buried resistivity discontinuity planes, a general formula is derived for the potential and the electric field component along any fixed direction on the ground surface. The total effect is written as a sum of elementary contributions, all of the same simple mathematical form. It is then demonstrated that the total electric power associated with the standing natural electric field component can be written in the space domain as a sum of cross‐correlation integrals between the observed component of the total electric field and the component of the field due to each single constitutive elementary charge. By means of the cross‐correlation bounding inequality, the concept of a scanning function is introduced as the key to the new interpretation procedure. In the space domain, the scanning function is the unit strength electric field component generated by an elementary positive charge. Next, the concept of charge occurrence probability is introduced as a suitable function for the tomographic imaging of the charge distribution geometry underground. This function is defined as the cross‐correlation product of the total observed electric field component and the scanning function, divided by the square root of the product of the respective variances. Using this physical scheme, the tomographic procedure is described. It consists of scanning the section, through any SP survey profile, by the unit strength elementary charge, which is given a regular grid of space coordinates within the section, at each point of which the charge occurrence probability function is calculated. The complete set of calculated grid values can be used to draw contour lines in order to single out the zones of highest probability of concentrations of polarized, primary and secondary electric charges. An extension to the wavenumber domain and to three‐dimensional tomography is also presented and discussed. A few simple synthetic examples are given to demonstrate the resolution power of the new SP inversion procedure."
flat earth,"It is commonly assumed that if the optical metric of a dielectric medium is identical to the metric of a vacuum space-time then light propagation through the dielectric mimics light propagation in the vacuum. However, just as the curved surface of the Earth cannot be mapped into a flat plane without distortion of some surface features, so too is it impossible to project the behavior of light from the vacuum into a dielectric analog residing in Minkowski space-time without introducing distortions. We study the covariance properties of dielectric analog space-times and the kinematics of a congruence of light in the analog, and show how certain features can be faithfully emulated in the analog depending on the choice of projection, but that not all features can be simultaneously emulated without distortion. These findings indicate conceptual weaknesses in the idea of using analog space-times as a basis for transformation optics, and we show that a certain formulation of transformation optics closely related to analog space-times resolves these issues."
flat earth,"Accreted terranes, comprising a wide variety of Jurassic and Cretaceous igneous and sedimentary rocks, are an important and conspicuous feature of Cuban geology. Although the Mesozoic igneous rocks are generally poorly exposed and badly altered, we have collected and geochemically analyzed 25 samples that place new constraints on plate tectonic models of the Caribbean region. From our recognizance sampling, six main lava types have been identified within the Mesozoic igneous rocks of Cuba: rift basalts, oceanic tholeiites, backarc basin lavas, boninites, island arc tholeiites (IAT), and calc-alkaline lavas. We suggest that the rift-related basalts may have formed during the development of the proto-Caribbean, as the Yucatan block rifted away from northern South America in Jurassic–Early Cretaceous time. The Early Cretaceous oceanic tholeiites have flat rare earth element patterns, and are compositionally similar to Pacific mantle plume–derived oceanic plateaus of similar age. The Early Cretaceous arc-related rocks are either backarc basalts, boninites, or relatively trace element–depleted IAT lavas. A limited amount of geochemical and field evidence hints that two parallel arc systems existed in the western proto-Caribbean area in Early Cretaceous time. This leads us to speculate that in the proto-Caribbean at this time there was a western arc with a northeast-dipping subduction zone erupting IAT lavas (with Farallon plate being consumed), and a more eastern boninitic arc with a southwest-dipping subduction zone (with proto-Caribbean plate being consumed). This latter arc was relatively short lived and after being aborted was mostly eroded away. The Cretaceous primitive (IAT) arc survived and, later in Cretaceous time, as this arc system moved into the widening gap between North and South Americas, calc-alkaline lavas began to be erupted. The evidence suggests that the change from IAT to calc-alkaline lavas was gradual and not abrupt. These new data, although limited, provide geochemical constraints on the tectonic development of the northern part of the Caribbean plate. In consequence, we present a new plate tectonic model for this area of the Caribbean."
flat earth,"High-altitude electromagnetic pulses (HEMPs) are magnetic field fluctuations generated by nuclear bombs detonated above the earth's surface. They have the potential to disrupt the power grid by inducing geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) on transmission lines. The magnitude of the GIC highly depends on the conductivity of the earth hundreds of thousands of meters beneath the surface. This paper describes a method to calculate HEMP electric fields using the one-dimensional (1-D) conductivity model, in which the earth is modeled with flat layers of varying thicknesses and conductivity levels. This method applies the 1-D conductivity model by modifying a publicly available HEMP electric field originally calculated under the uniform conductivity model. The electric fields resulting from each model have significant differences in magnitude and locational sensitivity. A comparison of these electric fields and their impact on a power system is presented using a 10 000 bus synthetic grid."
flat earth,"We measured Newton's gravitational constant G using a new torsion balance method. Our technique greatly reduces several sources of uncertainty compared to previous measurements: (1) It is insensitive to anelastic torsion fiber properties; (2) a flat plate pendulum minimizes the sensitivity due to the pendulum density distribution; (3) continuous attractor rotation reduces background noise. We obtain G = (6.674215+/-0.000092) x 10(-11) m3 kg(-1) s(-2); the Earth's mass is, therefore, M = (5.972245+/-0.000082) x 10(24) kg and the Sun's mass is M = (1.988435+/-0.000027) x 10(30) kg."
flat earth,"Design and performance data are presented for the Strato-spheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) instrument, which has been developed for the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS). SAGE II is designed to monitor globally the vertical distribution of stratospheric aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide by measuring the ex-tinction of solar radiation through the earth's atmosphere during the ERBS observatory solar occultations. Solar radiation is reflected from a flat scanning mirror into a Cassegrain telescope, which forms a solar image on the entrance slit of a grating spectrometer. The SAGE II instan-taneous field of view is scanned along the vertical solar diameter by the elevation scan mirror. The entire optical system is contained within an azimuth gimbal that tracks the solar radiometric centroid during the data event. This spectrometer, with help from three interference filters, iso-lates seven spectral wavelengths ranging from 0.385 um to 1.02 um. All seven channels use silicon photodiode detectors operated in the photo-voltaic mode. Detector outputs are multiplexed into a serial data stream for readout by the ERBS telemetry system. Each output is sampled 64 times per second and digitized to 12 bit resolution. SAGE II is a third generation instrument, following the highly successful Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement II (SAM II) and SAGE programs."
flat earth,"Historically, wireless sensor networks have mainly addressed military applications. However, in recent years, many civilian applications, such as managing inventory, monitoring product quality and monitoring disaster zones have emerged. Various technical issues, such as power consumption, radio propagation models, routing protocols, sensors etc need to be considered for different applications. In this paper, we propose a particular application for wireless sensor networks, specifically a water distribution network monitoring system. We propose a possible communication model for the water distribution monitoring network, and describe our channel measurement approach for the determination of an appropriate path-loss model. The accuracy of the proposed measurement approach has been confirmed using the flat earth two-ray model [1]."
flat earth,"III‐V semiconductors, GaAs and in particular InGaP, are used in many different electronic applications, such as high power and high frequency devices, laser diodes and high brightness LED. Their direct bandgap and high reliability make them ideal candidates for the realisation of high efficiency solar cells: in the past years they have been successfully used as power sources for satellites in space, where they are able to produce electricity from sunlight with an overall efficiency of around 30%. Nowadays, the use of arsenides and phosphides as photovoltaic (PV) devices is confined only to space applications since their price is much higher than conventional Si flat panel modules, the leading PV market technology. But with the introduction of multijunction solar cells capable of operating in high concentration solar light, the area and, therefore, the cost of these cells can be reduced and will eventually find an application and market also on Earth. This article will review the situation of semiconductor solar cell materials, focusing on Si, GaAs, InGaP and multijunction solar cells and will discuss future trends and possibilities of bringing III‐V technology from space to Earth.

flat earth,The microstructural evolution of hot-deformed Nd-Fe-B magnets in each stage of hot-deformation process was studied using transmission electron microscopy and three dimensional atom probe (3DAP). The anisotropic growth of initially isotropic grains in rapidly solidified alloy occurs by annealing without pressing. 3DAP analyses showed a higher concentration of rare-earth elements in the intergranular phase parallel to the flat surface of platelet shaped Nd2Fe14B grains compared to that in the intergranular phase at the side of platelets.
flat earth,"Observations upstream of the earth's bow shock with the LASL/MPI fast plasma experiments on ISEE 1 and 2 reveal the presence of two distinct and mutually exclusive populations of low energy (< or approx. =40keV) ions apparently accelerated at the bow shock. The first of these, the ''reflected'' population, is characterized by 1) sharply peaked spectra seldom extending much above approx. 10 keV/ion and 2) relatively collimated flow coming from the direction of the shock. On the other hand, the ''diffuse'' ions are distinguished by relatively flat energy spectra above approx. 10 keV and broad angular distributions. They are by far the most commonly observed upstream ion event. A close causal association is suggested between the diffuse ion population in the upstream solar wind and energetic plasma ions observed within the magnetosheath."
flat earth,"RBCO (R = Y or rare earth element) coated conductors (CC) are the most promising HTS materials for future high field coils operated at moderately high temperature (40-50 K). Coils are planned for the second generation of fusion reactors (DEMO, ""DEMOnstrator"") and beyond. A ROEBEL bar concept for a high current (kA-class) low AC loss cable is the most suitable assembling technique for conductors in magnet windings due to the flat rectangular cross section. The presented RACC-cable technique (RACC=ROEBEL assembled coated conductors) works with pre-shaping of tapes into strands with the ROEBEL specific meander geometry. The usually very good bending properties of the CC support the assembling procedure of the RACC-cable. We report on a 16 strand RACC-cable with 19 cm transposition length made from CC material from the commercial supplier SuperPower which reached 1020 A transport critical current at 77 K (Jeng = 11.3 kAcm-2). The basic properties of the virgin YBCO tapes and the shaped strands like orientation and field dependent transport currents, current homogeneity and bending effects, were investigated and correlated with the measured properties of the RACC-cable. Calculation of the self field effects by means of a model adapted to the specific RACC-cable geometry and in particular taking into account the current distribution in the cable, explained the 30% current reduction in the cable quantitatively."
flat earth,"Galactic cosmic ray flux at Earth is modulated by the heliospheric magnetic field. Heliospheric modulation potential, Φ, during grand solar minima is investigated using an open solar flux (OSF) model with OSF source based on sunspot number, R, and OSF loss on heliospheric current sheet inclination. Changing dominance between source and loss means Φ varies in‐ (anti‐) phase with R during strong (weak) cycles, in agreement with Φ estimates from ice core records of10Be concentration, which are in‐phase during most of the last 300 years, but anti‐phase during the Maunder Minimum. Model results suggest “flat” OSF cycles, such as solar cycle 20 result from OSF source and loss terms temporarily balancing throughout the cycle. Thus even if solar activity continues to decline steadily, the long‐term drop in OSF through SC21 to SC23 may plateau during SC24, though reemerge in SC25 with the inverted phase relation."
flat earth,"We study the gravitational clustering of big bang relic neutrinos onto existing cold dark matter (CDM) and baryonic structures within the flat ΛCDM model, using both numerical simulations and a semi-analytical linear technique, with the aim of understanding the neutrinos’ clustering properties for direct detection purposes. In a comparative analysis, we find that the linear technique systematically underestimates the amount of clustering for a wide range of CDM halo and neutrino masses. This invalidates earlier claims of the technique’s applicability. We then compute the approximate phase space distribution of relic neutrinos in our neighbourhood at Earth, and estimate the large scale neutrino density contrasts within the local Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin zone. With these findings, we discuss the implications of gravitational neutrino clustering for scattering-based detection methods, ranging from flux detection via Cavendish-type torsion balances, to target detection using accelerator beams and cosmic rays. For emission spectroscopy via resonant annihilation of extremely energetic cosmic neutrinos on the relic neutrino background, we give new estimates for the expected enhancement in the event rates in the direction of the Virgo cluster."

flat earth,"Provenance studies on Early to Middle Ordovician clastic formations of the southern Puna basin in north‐western Argentina indicate that the sedimentary detritus is generally composed of reworked crustal material. Tremadoc quartz‐rich turbidites (Tolar Chico Formation, mean composition Qt89 F7 L4) are followed by volcaniclastic rocks and greywackes (Tolillar Formation, mean Qt33 F42 L25). These are in turn overlain by volcaniclastic deposits (mean Qt24 F30 L46) of the Diablo Formation (late Arenig–early Llanvirn) that are intercalated by lava flows. All units were deformed in the Oclóyic Orogeny during the Middle and Late Ordovician. Sandstones of the Tolar Chico Formation are characterized by Th/Sc ratios > 1, La/Sc ratios ≈ 10, whereas associated fine‐grained wackes show slightly lower values for both ratios. LREE (light rare earth elements) enrichment of the arenites is ≈ 50× chondrite, Eu/Eu* values are between 0·72 and 0·92, and flat HREE (heavy rare earth elements) patterns indicate a derivation from mostly felsic rocks of typical upper crustal composition. The εNd(t = sed) values scatter around −11 to −9. The calculated Nd‐TDM residence ages vary between 1·8 and 2·0 Ga indicating contribution by a Palaeoproterozoic crustal component. The Th/Sc and La/Sc ratios of the Tolillar Formation are lower than those of the Tolar Chico Formation. Normalized REE (rare earth elements) patterns display a similar shape to PAAS (post‐Archaean average Australian shale) but with higher abundances of HREEs. Eu/Eu* values range between 0·44 and 1·17, where the higher values reflect the abundance of plagioclase and feldspar‐bearing volcanic lithoclasts. Average εNd(t = sed) values are less negative at −5·1, and Nd‐TDM are lower at 1·6 Ga. This is consistent with characteristics of regional rocks of upper continental crust composition, which most probably represent the sources of the studied detritus. The rocks of the Diablo Formation have the lowest Th/Sc and La/Sc ratios, lower LREE abundances than the average continental crust and are slightly enriched in HREEs. Eu/Eu* values are between 0·63 and 1·17. The Nd isotopes (εNd(t = sed) = −3 to −1; TDM = 1·2 Ga) indicate that one source component was less fractionated than both the underlying Early Ordovician and the overlying Middle Ordovician units. Synsedimentary vulcanites in the Diablo Formation show the same isotopic composition. Our data indicate that the sedimentary detritus is generally composed of reworked crustal material, but that the Diablo Formation appears to contain ≈ 80% of a less fractionated component, derived from a contemporaneous continental volcanic arc. There are no data indicating an exotic detrital source or the accretion of an exotic block at this part of the Gondwana margin during the Ordovician."
flat earth,"Rugged terrain significantly affects the Huan Jing (HJ)-1/CCD reflectance at the earth's surface because the sloping surfaces change the sun-surface-sensor geometry. It is necessary to consider the land surface directional reflectance and reduce topographic effects to obtain the correct reflectance. An atmospheric model 6S (second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum) coupled with bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) shape, which is well suited to estimate the HJ-1/CCD land surface reflectance of rugged terrain and flat surface (BRATC, BRDF-based atmospheric and topographic correction), is reformulated in this paper. The BRDF shape, a statistics-based MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) BRDF prior-knowledge look-up table (LUT) stored in this algorithm, is applied to the HJ-1/CCD reflectance estimation that covers Heihe River Basin, China. The results of the indirect validation of the visual image and the linear relationship between the reflectance and the cosine of the solar relative incident angle show that the algorithm effectively reduces topographic effects. Compared with three land cover field measurement reflectances, the HJ-1/CCD-corrected reflectance is consistently good with an overall RMSE as low as 0.0128. The proposed method could be designed for an operational system of HJ-1/CCD reflectance products."
flat earth,"For space–time processes on global or large scales, it is critical to use models that respect the Earth's spherical shape. The covariance functions of such processes should be not only positive definite on sphere × time, but also capable of capturing the dynamics of the processes well. We develop space–time covariance functions on sphere × time that are flexible in producing space–time interactions, especially space–time asymmetries. Our idea is to consider a sum of independent processes in which each process is obtained by applying a first-order differential operator to a fully symmetric process on sphere × time. The resulting covariance functions can produce various types of space–time interactions and give different covariance structures along different latitudes. Our approach yields explicit expressions for the covariance functions, which has great advantages in computation. Moreover, it applies equally well to generating asymmetric space–time covariance functions on flat or other spatial domains. We study various characteristics of our new covariance functions, focusing on their space–time interactions. We apply our model to a dataset of total column ozone levels in the Northern hemisphere."
flat earth,"The use of multiple wavelength emissions of rare earth-doped nanomaterials was investigated for optical nanothermometry, based on a ratiometric technique. A methodology, based on the luminescence associated to different pairs of thermally coupled Stark sublevels, was proposed. This new approach enabled the measurement of broad temperature ranges, in which the absolute sensitivity was optimized. The influence of this multiwavelength fluorescence intensity ratio nanothermometry on the relative temperature sensitivity was also discussed. A proof of concept of the proposed method was done using Er3+-doped Y2O3 nanocrystals as nanoprobes. The obtained results suggested that, with a suitable choice of nanophosphors, optical nanothermometers with high and flat absolute sensitivities in a wide range of temperatures can be tailored using the proposed methodology."
flat earth,"Solar energetic particles (SEPs), a major component of space weather, propagate through the interplanetary medium strongly guided by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). In this work, we analyze the implications that a flat Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) has on proton propagation from SEP release sites to the Earth. We simulate proton propagation by integrating fully 3D trajectories near an analytically defined flat current sheet, collecting comprehensive statistics into histograms, fluence maps, and virtual observer time profiles within an energy range of 1–800 MeV. We show that protons experience significant current sheet drift to distant longitudes, causing time profiles to exhibit multiple components, which are a potential source of confusing interpretations of observations. We find that variation of the current sheet thickness within a realistic parameter range has little effect on particle propagation. We show that the IMF configuration strongly affects the deceleration of protons. We show that in our model, the presence of a flat equatorial HCS in the inner heliosphere limits the crossing of protons into the opposite hemisphere."
flat earth,"The differential INSAR technique has the potential for monitoring centimeter-scale ground motion in an accurate and costeffective manner. Probably the most important limiting factor in the application of INSAR is temporal change in the complex reflectivity of the ground surface during the period between radar acquisitions. This can be due to changes in such parameters as moisture content or vegetation. The stable artificial corner reflectors can be identified from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images even with large baselines, and therefore decrease the risk of image decorrelation. This paper will discuss the following questions: 1) how to obtain the true phase of a corner reflector in a SAR complex image; 2) how to co-register the corner reflector pixels when the coherence of its surrounding area is extremely low; 3) how to select the interpolation kernel to resample the SAR image; and, 4) how to compute the interferometric phase of two co-registered corner reflectors without flat earth term and corners’ height contribution. In order to demonstrate the results, a practical example of landslide monitoring in the Three Gorges area in China is presented."
flat earth,"During normal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing, a flat Earth is assumed when performing radiometric corrections such as antenna pattern and scattering area removal. The authors examine the effects of topographic variations on these corrections. Local slopes will cause the actual scattering area to be different from that calculated using the flat Earth assumption. It is shown that this effect may easily cause calibration errors larger than a decibel. Ignoring the topography during antenna pattern removal may also introduce errors of several decibels in the case of airborne systems. The effect of topography on antenna pattern removal is expected to be negligible for spaceborne SARs. The authors show how these effects can be taken into account if a digital elevation model is available for the imaged area. The errors are quantified for two different types of terrain, a moderate relief area near Tombstone, AZ, and a high relief area near Oetztal in the Austrian Alps. The authors show errors for two well-known radar systems, the C-band ERS-1 spaceborne radar system and the three frequency NASA/JPL airborne SAR system (AIRSAR). >"
flat earth,"Abstract. Long-term monitoring of the Earth-reflected solar spectrum is necessary for discerning and attributing changes in climate. High radiometric accuracy enables such monitoring over decadal timescales with non-overlapping instruments, and high precision enables trend detection on shorter timescales. The HyperSpectral Imager for Climate Science (HySICS) is a visible and near-infrared spatial/spectral imaging spectrometer intended to ultimately achieve ∼ 0.2 % radiometric accuracies of Earth scenes from space, providing an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing space-based imagers. On-orbit calibrations from measurements of spectral solar irradiances acquired by direct views of the Sun enable radiometric calibrations with superior long-term stability than is currently possible with any manmade spaceflight light source or detector. Solar and lunar observations enable in-flight focal-plane array (FPA) flat-fielding and other instrument calibrations. The HySICS has demonstrated this solar cross-calibration technique for future spaceflight instrumentation via two high-altitude balloon flights. The second of these two flights acquired high-radiometric-accuracy measurements of the ground, clouds, the Earth's limb, and the Moon. Those results and the details of the uncertainty analyses of those flight data are described."
flat earth,"We explore cloudy, extended H2-He atmosphere scenarios for the warm super-Earth GJ 1214b using an optimal estimation retrieval technique. This planet, orbiting an M4.5 star only 13 pc from the Earth, is of particular interest because it lies between the Earth and Neptune in size and may be a member of a new class of planet that is neither terrestrial nor gas giant. Its relatively flat transmission spectrum has so far made atmospheric characterization difficult. The Non-linear optimal Estimator for MultivariateE spectral analySIS (NEMESIS) algorithm is used to explore the degenerate model parameter space for a cloudy, H2-He-dominated atmosphere scenario. Optimal estimation is a data-led approach that allows solutions beyond the range permitted by ab initio equilibrium model atmosphere calculations, and as such prevents restriction from prior expectations. We show that optimal estimation retrieval is a powerful tool for this kind of study, and present an exploration of the degenerate atmospheric scenarios for GJ 1214b. Whilst we find a family of solutions that provide a very good fit to the data, the quality and coverage of these data are insufficient for us to more precisely determine the abundances of cloud and trace gases given an H2-He atmosphere, and we also cannot rule out the possibility of a high molecular weight atmosphere. Future ground- and space-based observations will provide the opportunity to confirm or rule out an extended H2-He atmosphere, but more precise constraints will be limited by intrinsic degeneracies in the retrieval problem, such as variations in cloud top pressure and temperature."
flat earth,"The method and apparatus used in the measurements are substantially those described in a paper ""On Some Determinations of the Sign and Magnitude of Electric Discharges in Lightning Flashes."" The induced charge on an exposed earthed conductor (test-plate or sphere) is used as a measure of the electric field. The testplate virtually forms part of a flat portion of the earth’s surface, and the vertical electric force or potential gradient at ground level is equal (in electrostatic measure) to 4 π Q/A, where Q is the charge on its exposed surface and A is its area. The charge Q on the earth-connected sphere of radius R, when exposed at a height h , great compared with R, is a measure of the potential at that height; the zero potential of the sphere being the resultant of the undisturbed atmospheric potential V at the height h and of the potential Q/R due to the charge on the sphere, so that Q/R = - V. The earthed conductors can be shielded from the earth’s field: the test-plate by means of an earth-connected cover, the sphere by lowering it into a conducting case resting on the ground. The quantity of electricity which flows to earth through the connecting wire on exposing or shielding the test-plate or sphere, is measured by a special type of capillary electrometer in which the readings indicate the total quantity of electricity which has traversed the instrument ; the sign and magnitude of the charge on the exposed conductor, and thus of the potential gradient, at the beginning and end of an exposure are thus determined. The sign and magnitude of sudden changes of potential gradient which occur while the conductor is exposed are indicated by the direction and magnitude of the resulting displacements of the electrometer meniscus. The total flow of electricity between the atmosphere and the test-plate or sphere during an exposure is also measured —being given by the difference between the electrometer readings before and after the exposure. The principal improvement introduced has been the provision of apparatus for giving a photographic trace of the electrometer readings; rapid changes in the field occupying less than one-tenth of a second are in this way recorded. In the observations described in the previous paper the sphere was supported in a manner which did not admit of absolute measurements being made, as the charge measured included that on the upper part of the support as well as that on the sphere itself; in these earlier measurements therefore the sphere was standardised by comparison with the test-plate. The method of supporting the sphere is now such that the charge on the sphere alone is measured, while the disturbing effect of the earthed supporting rod is small, and thus the potential at the level of the earthconnected sphere can be calculated from the charge upon it. The new method of mounting the sphere is shown in fig. 1."
flat earth,"Aims: We aim to extend our current observational understanding of the integrated planet Earth spectropolarimetry from the optical to the near-infrared wavelengths. Major biomarkers like O$_{\rm 2}$ and water vapor are strong flux absorbents in the Earth atmosphere and some linear polarization of the reflected stellar light is expected to occur at these wavelengths. 
Methods: Simultaneous optical ($0.4-0.9$ $\mu$m) and near-infrared ($0.9-2.3$ $\mu$m) linear spectropolarimetric data of the earthshine were acquired by observing the nightside of the waxing Moon. The data have sufficient spectral resolution (2.51 nm in the optical, and 1.83 and 2.91 nm in the near-infrared) to resolve major molecular species present in the Earth atmosphere. 
Results: We find the highest values of linear polarization ($\ge 10\%$) at the bluest wavelengths, which agrees with the literature. Linear polarization intensity steadily decreases towards red wavelengths reaching a nearly flat value beyond $\sim$0.8 $\mu$m. In the near-infrared, we measured a polarization degree of $\sim4.5 \%$ for the continuum. We report the detection of molecular features due to O$_{2}$ at $0.760, 1.25 \mu$m and H$_{2}$O at 0.653$-$0.725 $\mu$m, 0.780$-$0.825 $\mu$m, 0.93 and 1.12 $\mu$m in the spectropolarimetric data; most of them show high linear polarimetry degrees above the continuum. In particular, the broad H$_{2}$O 1.12 $\mu$m band displays a polarimetric intensity as high as that of the blue optical. These features may become a powerful tool to characterize Earth-like planets in polarized light."
flat earth,"Surface wave propagation along multi-mixed-paths with irregular terrain over spherical Earth in two-dimension (2D) is discussed. For the first time in the literature, sea-land-sea (island) transition problem including non-flat (hilly) islands is investigated systematically. A finite element method based multi-mixed path surface wave virtual propagation predictor tool FEMIX is developed for this purpose. FEMIX, tested and calibrated against analytical ray-mode reference models accommodated with the Millington curve fitting approaches, is shown to be capable of modeling propagation along sea surface having multiple hilly islands over MF (300 kHz - 3 MHz) and HF (3 - 30 MHz) bands."
flat earth,"We have used Sun–Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation observations obtained from the STEREO A and B spacecraft to study complementary face-on and edge-on views of coronal streamers. The face-on views are analogous to what one might see looking down on a flat equatorial streamer belt at sunspot minimum, and show streamer blobs as diffuse arches gradually expanding outward from the Sun. With the passage of time, the legs of the arches fade, and the ejections appear as a series of azimuthal structures like ripples on a pond. The arched topology is similar to that obtained in face-on views of streamer disconnection events (including in/out pairs and streamer blowout mass ejections), and suggests that streamer blobs have the helical structure of magnetic flux ropes."
flat earth,"The three well-documented occurrences of three-dimensional stromatolites older than 3.2 Ga meet most criteria for biogenicity except the presence of fossil bacteria. However, they also show features more consistent with nonbiological origins. Small conical structures in the Strelley Pool chert in the upper part of the Warrawoona Group (3.5-3.2 Ga), Western Australia, lack the structure typical of stromatolites and probably formed mainly through evaporitc precipitation. A domal structure from the North Pole chert, Warrawoona Group, formed by soft-sediment deformation or originally flat layers. Laminated chert containing domal and pseudocolumnar structures in the Onverwacht Group (3.5-3.3 Ga), Barberton Greenstone Belt, South Africa, extends downward into veins and cavities, where it formed through inorganic precipitation. Although bacterial communities were widespread on Earth prior to 3.2 Ga, these particular three-dimensional structures are probably abiotic in origin and do not provide information on the paleobiology or paleoecology of early organisms. The paucity of Archean stromatolites older than 3.2 Ga probably reflects the paucity of known and possibly extant carbonate deposits of this age."
flat earth,"The Oligo-Miocene Somuncura province is the largest ( (cid:1) 55 000 km 2 ) back-arc mafic volcanic field in Patagonia, and one of Earth’s largest with no clear link to a hotspot or major extension. Major and trace element and Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic data suggest involvement of a plume-like component in the mantle magma source mixed with hydrous, but not high field strength element (HFSE)-depleted components, from a disintegrating subducting plate. Magmatism is attributed to mantle upwelling related to disturbances during plate reorganization, possibly at a time when the South America plate was nearly stationary over the underlying mantle. Melting was enhanced by hydration of the mantle during Paleogene subduction. Crustal contamination was minimal in a refractory crust that had been extensively melted in the Jurassic. Eruption began with low-volume intraplate alkaline mafic flows with depleted Nd–Sr isotopic signatures. These were followed by voluminous (cid:1) 29–25 Ma tholeiitic mafic flows with flat light and steep heavy rare earth element (REE) patterns, intraplate-like La/Ta ratios, arc-like Ba/La ratios and enriched Sr–Nd isotopic signatures. Their source can be explained by mixing EM1–Tristan da Cunha-like and depleted mantle components with subduction-related components. Post-plateau (cid:1) 24–17 Ma alkaline flows with steep REE patterns, high incompatible element abundances, and depleted Sr–Nd isotopic signatures mark the ebbing of the mantle upwelling."
flat earth,"In Epicurean Meteorology Frederik Bakker discusses the meteorology as laid out by Epicurus (341-270 BCE) and Lucretius (1st century BCE). Although in scope and organization their ideas are clearly rooted in the Peripatetic tradition, their meteorology sets itself apart from this tradition by its systematic use of multiple explanations and its sole reliance on sensory evidence as opposed to mathematics and other axiomatic principles. Through a thorough investigation of the available evidence Bakker offers an updated and qualified account of Epicurean meteorology, arguing against Theophrastus’ authorship of the Syriac meteorology, highlighting the originality of Lucretius’ treatment of mirabilia, and refuting the oft-repeated claim that the Epicureans held the earth to be flat."
flat earth,"BACKGROUND
According to the linguistic determinism approach, knowledge of sentential complements such as: John says that the earth is flat plays a crucial role in theory of mind (ToM) development by providing a means to represent explicitly people's mental attitudes and beliefs. This approach predicts that mastery of complements determines successful belief reasoning across explicit ToM tasks, even low-verbal ones, and across populations.

(1) To investigate the link between a low-verbal ToM-task and complements in Specific Language Impairment (SLI), (2) To determine whether this population shows similar ToM performance to that of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or those with Typical Development (TD) once these groups are matched on competency for complements, (3) To explore whether complements conveying a falsehood without jeopardizing the veracity of the entire sentence, such as complements of verbs of communication, are more crucial for belief attribution than complements which do not have this property, namely complements of verbs of perception, (?John sees that the earth is flat).


METHODS & PROCEDURES
Children with SLI (n = 20), with ASD (n = 34) and TD (n = 30) completed sentence-picture-matching tasks assessing complementation with communication and perception verbs, as well as a picture-sequencing task assessing ToM. Children were furthermore evaluated for general grammatical and lexical abilities and non-verbal IQ.


OUTCOMES & RESULTS
Results reveal that competency on complements relates to ToM performance with a low-verbal task in SLI, and that SLI, ASD and TD groups of equivalent performance on complements also perform similarly for ToM. Results further suggest that complements with an independent truth-value are the only ones to show a significant relation to ToM performance after teasing out the impact of non-verbal reasoning.


CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS
This study suggests that clinical groups of different aetiologies as well as TD children perform comparably for ToM once they have similar complementation skills. Findings further highlight that specific types of complements, namely those with an independent truth value, relate in a special way to mentalizing. Future work should determine whether these specific structures could be effective in ToM remediation programmes."
flat earth,"The Hongshishan mafic–ultramafic intrusion (SIMS zircon U–Pb age 286.4 ± 2.8 Ma) consists of dunite, clinopyroxene peridotite, troctolite, and gabbro. Major elements display systematic correlations. Trace elements have identical distribution patterns, including flat rare-earth element (REE) patterns with positive Eu anomalies and enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) but depletions in Nb and Ta, indicating fractional crystallization as a key factor in magmatic evolution. Petrologic and geochemical variations in drill core samples demonstrate that minor assimilation and progressive magma injections were closely associated with Ni–Cu mineralization. Mass balance estimates and Sr–Nd isotopes reveal that the Hongshishan parental magmas were high-Mg and low-Ti tholeiitic basalts and were derived from a lithospheric mantle source that had been modified by subducted slab metasomatism before partial melting. Southward subduction of the Palaeo-Tianshan–Junggar Ocean is further constrained by a compilation of inferred, subduction-induced modifications of mantle sources in mafic–ultramafic intrusions distributed in the eastern Tianshan–Beishan area. Integrating the regional positive ϵNd(t) granites, high-Mg and low-Ti basaltic magmas (mafic–ultramafic intrusions), and slightly later high-Ti basalts in NW China suggests that their petrogenesis could be attributed to Permian mantle plume activities."
flat earth,"The Spanish Royal Decree 661/2007 for the regulation of renewable energy allows operators of power plants to participate directly on the electricity market instead of reverting to flat-rate prices. The premium tariff option motivates operators of renewable energy plants to increasingly act like managers of conventional plants, selling electricity at the liberalized market. Just like a normal market participant, the operator places bids in advance on the day-ahead market and is obliged to fulfill them. Thus, there is the need for operators of renewable energy plants to be able to provide predictable and dispatchable energy in the profitable premium tariff. This legal setting motivates the following analysis on the value of irradiance forecasts for determining optimal operation strategies of solar power plants. The scientific background of this study are ongoing research activities on the use of satellite-based now casting of solar irradiance using cloud motion vector techniques and on data assimilation of aerosols into air quality models as a basis for day-ahead irradiance forecasts. The influence of a schedule based on imperfect forecasts on the daily revenue for a solar thermal power plant is assessed. Three typical weather situations are analyzed: clear-sky, overcast, and aerosol-charged situations. This paper shows the economic potential of the participation at the premium tariff with optimized operation strategies using direct solar irradiance forecasts based on Earth observation techniques."
flat earth,"Superconducting gravimeters (SG) measure temporal changes of the Earth’s gravity field with high accuracy and long-term stability. Variations in local water storage components (snow, soil moisture, groundwater, surface water, and water stored by vegetation) can have a significant influence on SG measurements and — from a geodetic perspective — add noise to the SG records. At the same time, this hydrological gravity signal can provide substantial information about the quantification of water balances. A 4D forward model with a spatially nested discretization domain was developed to investigate the local hydrological gravity effect on the SG records of the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell, Germany. The possible maximum gravity effect was investigated using hypothetical water storage changes based on physical boundary conditions. Generally, on flat terrain, a water mass change of 1 m in the model domain causes a gravity change of 42 μGal . Simulation results show that topography increases this value to 52 μGal ..."
flat earth,"Received 4 December 2009; revised 16 March 2010; accepted 30 March 2010; published 27 July 2010. [1] In the companion paper, we identified a repeatable sequence of events leading to substorm onset in THEMIS all‐sky imager observations: enhanced flows bring new plasma into the plasma sheet. The new plasma then moves earthward as a flow channel, bringing it to the near‐Earth plasma sheet and where it produces onset instability. New plasma entering the dusk (dawn) convection cell drifts equatorward and eastward and then around the Harang reversal, leading to pre‐midnight (near‐ and post‐midnight) onset. Here we present evidence supporting this sequence using incoherent scatter radar (ISR) ionospheric observations. Using the Sondrestrom ISR, we find that enhanced flows of new plasma commonly enter the plasma sheet from the polar cap ∼8 min prior to onset. These flows are related to poleward boundary intensification signatures, consistent with the inferences from the imagers. Using the Poker Flat ISR (PFISR), we find that shortly before onset, enhanced westward flows reach the subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) region equatorward of the Harang reversal (dusk‐cell onsets) or enhanced eastward flows enter the onset region from the poleward direction (dawn‐cell onset). PFISR proton precipitation signatures are consistent with the possibility that the enhanced flows consist of reduced‐entropy plasma sheet plasma, and that onset occurs poleward of much of the enhanced SAPS flow (dusk‐cell onsets) or equatorward of the enhanced eastward flows (dawn‐cell onsets). Consistency with reduced entropy plasma is seen only within the enhanced flows, leading us to suggest that intrusion of low‐entropy plasma may alter the radial gradient of entropy toward onset instability."
flat earth,"Validation is mandatory to quantify the reliability of satellite biophysical products that are now routinely generated by a range of sensors. This paper presents the VALERI project dedicated to the validation of the products derived from medium resolution satellite sensors (www. avignon.inra.fr/valeri/). It describes the sites used, and the methodology developed to get the high spatial resolution map of the biophysical variables considered, i.e. LAI , fAPAR and fCover that can be estimated from ground level gap fraction measurements. Sites were selected to represent , with the other validation projects, the large variation of biomes and conditions observed over the Earth’s surface. Each site is about 3 × 3 km² in size and should be flat and relatively homogeneous at the medium resolution scale. For each site, the methodology used to generate the high spatial resolution biophysical variable maps is described. It is mainly based on concurent use of local gound measurements and a high spatial resolution satellite image, generally SPOT-HRV. Local ground measurements should be representative of an elementary sampling unit (ESU) that has approximately the same size as a SPOT-HRV pixel. The ground measurements mainly consist of gap fraction measurements achieved with LAI-2000 or hemispherical photographs. The ESUs are selected over the whole 3 × 3 km² site in order to sample the range of vegetation types observed. A transfer function is subsequently established over the ESUs to relate the ground measurements of the biophysical variables considered to the correspodonding high spatial resolution satellite image data. Finally, co-kriging is applied to generate the high spatial resolution map of the biophysical variables over the 3 × 3 km² area. The methodology presented in this paper can serve as a basis for validating medium resolution satellite products. These methodological aspects are discussed and conclusions drawn on the limitations and prospects of beforementioned validation activity."
flat earth,"SUMMARY We have developed a method of geodetic data inversion for slip distribution on a fault with an unknown dip angle. A common strategy for obtaining slip distribution in previous studies is to first determine the fault geometry by minimizing the square misfit under the assumption of a uniform slip on a rectangular fault, and then apply the usual linear inversion technique to estimate a slip distribution on the determined fault. It is not guaranteed, however, that the fault determined under the assumption of a uniform slip gives the best fault geometry for a spatially variable slip distribution. The inverse problem is non-linear for cases with unknown fault geometries, but the non-linearity of the problems is actually weak, when we can assume the fault surface to be a flat plane. In particular, when a clear trace of coseismic faults is observed on the Earth’s surface, only the dip angle is an unknown parameter to determine the fault geometry. Then, we regarded the dip angle as an hyperparameter that prescribed the structure of parametric models, and obtained the best estimate of the dip angle using Akaike’s Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC). With the best estimate of the dip angle, we can obtain the slip distribution on the fault based on the maximum-likelihood principle. We applied the method to the InSAR data of the 1995 Dinar, Turkey earthquake and obtained a much lower dip angle than the previous analyses."
flat earth,"Lake Mead is a large reservoir in Nevada, formed by the construction of the 221-m-high Hoover Dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. The lake encompasses an area of 635 km2, and the total volume of the reservoir is 35.5 km3. Filling started in February 1935. On the basis of a first-order leveling in 1935, several levelings were carried out to measure the deformation induced by the load of the reservoir. Subsidence in the central parts of the lake relative to the first leveling was around 120 mm (1941), 218 mm (1950), and 200 mm (1963). The subsidence pattern clearly shows relaxation of the underlying basement due to the water load of the lake, which ceased after 1950. Modeling of the relaxation process by means of layered, viscoelastic, compressible flat Earth models with a detailed representation of the spatial and temporal distribution of the water load shows that the thickness of the elastic crust underneath Lake Mead is 30±3 km. The data are also consistent with a 10-km-thick elastic upper crust and a 20-km-thick viscoelastic lower crust, with 1020 Pa s as a lower bound for its viscosity. The subcrust has an average viscosity of 1018±0.2 Pa s, a surprisingly low value. The leveling data constrain the viscosity profile down to ∼200 km depth."
flat earth,"We present a new interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) processing approach that capitalizes on the precise orbit tracking that is available with modern radar satellites. Our method uses an accurate orbit information along with motion-compensation techniques to propagate the radar echoes to positions along a noninertial virtual orbit frame in which the location and focusing equations are particularly simple, so that images are focused without requiring autofocus techniques and are computed efficiently. Motion compensation requires two additional focus correction phase terms that are implemented in the frequency domain. If the images from an interferometric pair or stack are all computed along the same reference orbit, flat-Earth topographic correction is not needed, and image coregistration is simplified, obviating many difficulties that are often encountered in InSAR processing. We process several data sets collected by the ALOS PALSAR instrument and find that the geodetic accuracy of the radar images is 10-20 m, with up to 20 m of additional image distortion needed to align 100 km × 100 km scenes with reference digital elevation models. We validated the accuracy by using both known radar corner reflector locations and by the registration of the interferograms with digital maps. The topography-corrected interferograms are free from all geometric phase terms, and they clearly show the geophysical observables of crustal deformation, atmospheric phase, and ionospheric phase."
flat earth,"Observations obtained upstream of the earth's bowshock with the LASL/MPI plasma instruments and the UCLA magnetometers on ISEE-1 and 2 have revealed a striking relationship between the presence of low-frequency fluctuations in solar wind density and field strength and the different types of distribution functions of upstream ions. Waves are absent when the ions have the beamlike distribution of the ''reflected'' ions. Large-amplitude waves are present only in conjuction with the ''diffuse'' ions, which are characterized by flat energy spectra and broad angular distributions. The waves are largely compressive, showing very good correlation between oscillations in magnetic field strength and plasma density."
flat earth,"For GNSS receivers where ground aiding service such as AGPS is not available, space borne GNSS aiding based on LEO satellites is a meaningful alternative. For space-borne GNSS aiding, Doppler positioning is generally used for user position initialization. In extreme cases, Doppler positioning may be the only means for positioning. In this work, we analyzed the doppler positioning performance bounds based on the spherical-earth model which is an significant step forward than that based on the flat model in existing work. Extensive simulations are conducted and both theoretical error distributions and practical results based on original LING QIAO GPS (Int'l ID:40136) readings are given. The results show that:(1) Doppler positioning based on full one pass data can achieve a performance that less than 100m most of the time; (2) The results based on the sphericalearth model are different, but are believed to be more accurate than the results based on the flat model."
flat earth,"Plate tectonics is a unique feature of Earth, and it plays a dominant role in transporting Earth's internally generated heat. It also governs the nature, shape, and the motion of the surface of Earth. The initiation of plate tectonics on Earth has been difficult to establish observationally, and modeling of the plate breaking process has not consistently accounted for the nature of the preplate tectonic Earth. We have performed numerical simulations of heat transport in the preplate tectonic Earth to understand the transition to plate tectonic behavior. This period of time is dominated by volcanic heat transport called the heat pipe mode of planetary cooling. These simulations of Earth's mantle include heat transport by melting and melt segregation (volcanism), Newtonian temperature‐dependent viscosity, and internal heating. We show that when heat pipes are active, the lithosphere thickens and lithospheric isotherms are kept flat by the solidus. Both of these effects act to suppress plate tectonics. As volcanism wanes, conduction begins to control lithospheric thickness, and large slopes arise at the base of the lithosphere. This produces large lithospheric stress and focuses it on the thinner regions of the lithosphere resulting in plate breaking events."
flat earth,"This paper describes methods for computing minimum-time flight paths at high altitudes in the presence of strong horizontal wind s. The first method shows how to calculate nonlinear feedback (“dynamic programming”) solutions for minimum-time flight paths. To do this the Zermelo Problem for arbitrary winds is extended from a flat earth model to a spherical earth model as a two-state problem (latit ude and longitude) with one control (heading angle). Many minimum-time paths are calculated backwards from New York JFK Airport and San Francisco International Airport to points in the continental U.S. Then the optimal heading angle and the minimum-time can be found by interpolation given the current latitude and longitude using an interpolant created by Delaunay triangulation. The second method is based on an analytical neighboring optimal control solution that computes neighboring optimal heading commands as a function of the winds along a nominal flight path. As an example, minimum-time paths to New York and San Francisco are determined for the actual jet stream winds on 14 February 2001 at 36 kft."
flat earth,"A debris-avalanche deposit extends 43 km northwestward from the base of Mount Shasta across the floor of Shasta Valley, California, where it covers an area of at least 450 km 2 . The surface of the deposit is dotted with hundreds of mounds, hills, and ridges, all formed of blocks of pyroxene andesite and unconsolidated volcaniclastic deposits derived from an ancestral Mount Shasta. Individual hills are separated by flat-topped laharlike deposits that also form the matrix of the debris avalanche and slope northwestward about 5 m/km. Radiometric ages of rocks in the deposit and of a postavalanche basalt flow indicate that the avalanche occurred between about 300,000 and 360,000 yr ago. An inferred average thickness of the deposit, plus a computed volume of about 4 km 3 for the hills and ridges, indicate an estimated volume of about 26 km 3 , making it the largest known Quaternary landslide on Earth."
flat earth,"Carbon, the backbone material of life on Earth, comes in three modifications: diamond, graphite, and fullerenes. Diamond develops tetrahedral sp3 bonds, forming a cubic crystal structure, whereas graphite and fullerenes are characterized by planar sp2 bonds. Polycrystalline graphite is the basis for many products of everyday life: pencils, lubricants, batteries, arc lamps, and brushes for electric motors. In crystalline form, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is used as a diffracting element in monochromators for x-ray and neutron scattering and as a calibration standard for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The graphite surface is easily prepared as a clean atomically flat surface by cleavage. This feature is attractive and is used in many laboratories as the surface of choice for “seeing atoms.” Despite the proverbial ease of imaging graphite by STM with atomic resolution, every second atom in the hexagonal surface unit cell remains hidden, and STM images show only a single atom in the unit cell. Here we present measurements with a low-temperature atomic force microscope with pico-Newton force sensitivity that reveal the hidden surface atom."
flat earth,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a method to conduct small satellite rendezvous mission by using the differential aerodynamic forces under J2 perturbation in low earth orbit (LEO). Design/methodology/approach – Each spacecraft is assumed to be equipped with two large flat plates, which can be controlled for generating differential accelerations in all three directions. Based on the kinetic theory, the aerodynamic lift and drag generated by a flat plate are calculated. To describe the relative dynamics under J2 perturbation, a modified model is derived from the high-fidelity linearized J2 equations proposed by Schweighart and Sedwick. Findings – Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is valid and efficient to solve satellite rendezvous problem, and the modified model considering J2 effect shows better accuracy than the Horsley’s Clohessy–Wiltshire-based model.

flat earth,"Abstract : Project Prairie Grass was a field program designed to provide experimental data on the diffusion of a tracer gas over a range of 800 meters. In each of 70 experiments the gas was released continuously for 10 minutes at a source located near ground level. The gas releases were made over a flat prairie in Nebraska under a variety of meteorological conditions during July and August of 1956. A brief history of the project is included with detailed descriptions of the tracer technique and the meteorological equipment employed in the field program. Tabulations of the diffusion data and the meteorological data collected during the gas releases are also presented. In addition, data is presented on the heat budget at the air-earth interface during other selected periods during the summer of 1956."
flat earth,"Many papers on meteorite impact suggest that large impacts can induce volcanic eruptions through decompression melting of the underlying rocks. We perform numerical simulations of the impact of an asteroid with a diameter of 20 km striking at 15 km·s−1 into a target with a near-surface temperature gradient of 13 K·km−1 (“cold” case) or 30 K·km−1 (“hot” case). The impact creates a 250–300-km-diameter crater with ∼10,000 km3 of impact melt. However, the crater collapses almost flat, and the pressure field returns almost to the initial lithostat. Even an impact this large cannot raise mantle material above the peridotite solidus by decompression. Statistical considerations also suggest that impacts cannot be the common initiator of large igneous provinces any time in post–heavy bombardment Earth history."
flat earth,"ABSTRACT Despite incontrovertible scientific evidence to support a round Earth, GIS software implementation typically models the Earth with flat map projections. This choice has consequences that vary from mild to severe. This paper explores solutions that range from moderate measures to correct for map projection errors to radical revisions of standard practice that place all calculations on the ellipsoid. On examination, the best practice requires a distinct projection choice for each geometric operation. Multiple reasons, from the technical to ethical, justify revised practices and increased vigilance for the errors induced by inappropriate projections."
flat earth,".tr Abstract Powerful propagation-pred iction tools, based on the split-step Fourier-transfor m and the Finite-Element-M ethod (FEM) solutions of the parabolic equation (PE) are discussed. The parabolic equation represents one-way propagation, and is widely used in two-dimensional (20) groundwave propagation modeling. It takes the Earth's curvature, the atmospheric refractivity variations, non-flat terrain scattering, and the boundary losses into account. MA TLAB-based numerical split-step parabolic­ equation and Finite-Element-M ethod parabolic-equati on routines were developed. These were used in canonical tests and comparisons to illustrate that the parabolic equation accounts for all of these effects. Both tools were calibrated against an analytical exact solution."
flat earth,"TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement) opens a new era in spaceborne radar remote sensing. The main objective of the mission is to generate an accurate three-dimensional image of the Earth, homogeneous in quality and unprecedented in accuracy. TanDEM-X generates a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 12 m posting and relative height accuracy of 2 m and 4 m for flat and steep terrain, respectively. This paper presents a description of the technique to quantify the DEM performance in terms of the relative height error, based on the height error map annotated in the TanDEM-X products. Therefore the results are separated in steep and flat terrain, as well as in land classes. First results obtained from TanDEM-X intermediate DEMs of different land cover types are shown."
flat earth,"The Quick Urban and Industrial Complex (QUIC) plume modeling system is used to explore how the transport and dispersion of vehicle emissions in cities are impacted by the presence of buildings. Using downtown Philadelphia as a test case, notional vehicle emissions of gases and particles are specified as line source releases on a subset of the east–west and north–south streets. Cases were run in flat terrain and with 3D buildings present in order to show the differences in the model-computed outdoor concentration fields with and without buildings present. The QUIC calculations show that buildings result in regions with much higher concentrations and other areas with much lower concentrations when compared to the flat-earth case. On the roads with vehicle emissions, street-level concentrations were up to a factor of 10 higher when buildings were on either side of the street as compared to the flat-earth case due to trapping of pollutants between buildings. However, on roads without vehicle emissions and in other open areas, the concentrations were up to a factor of 100 times smaller as compared to the flat earth case because of vertical mixing of the vehicle emissions to building height in the cavity circulation that develops on the downwind side of unsheltered buildings. QUIC was also used to calculate infiltration of the contaminant into the buildings. Indoor concentration levels were found to be much lower than outdoor concentrations because of deposition onto indoor surfaces and particulate capture for buildings with filtration systems. Large differences in indoor concentrations from building to building resulted from differences in leakiness, air handling unit volume exchange rates, and filter type and for naturally ventilated buildings, whether or not the building was sheltered from the prevailing wind by a building immediately upwind."
flat earth,"A high-energy neutrino telescope, such as the AMANDA detector, may detect neutrinos produced in sources, distant by a 1000 megaparsecs, which produce mostly ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e}$ or ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\mu}}$ neutrinos. Above 1 PeV, ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e}$ and ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\mu}}$ are absorbed by charged-current interactions in the Earth, but the Earth never becomes opaque to ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\tau}}$ since the ${\ensuremath{\tau}}^{\ensuremath{-}}$ produced in a charged-current ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\tau}}$ interaction decays back into ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\tau}}$. This provides an experimental signature for neutrino oscillations. The appearance of a ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\tau}}$ component would be evident as a flat zenith angle dependence of a source intensity at the highest neutrino energies, which would indicate ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\tau}}$ mixing with a sensitivity to $\ensuremath{\Delta}{m}^{2}$ as low as ${10}^{\ensuremath{-}17}{\mathrm{eV}}^{2}$, for the farthest sources. In addition, the presence of tau neutrino mixing would allow neutrino astronomy well beyond the PeV cutoff, possibly out to the energies of protons observed above ${10}^{20}\mathrm{eV}$."

This book shows how: believers in a flat earth helped Columbus accidentally discover America; how the medieval myth of Prester John, the Christian king in Asia, assisted the European drive eastward; and how the myth of the Rosicrucians affected the Masons, leading in turn to the widespread belief in a Jewish masonic plot to dominate the world and other forms of paranoid anti-Semitism in the 19th and 20th centuries."
flat earth,"The Hayachine and Miyamori hydrous ultramafic complexes, northeastern Japan, exhibit not only diverse lithological variations from very primordial spinel lherzolites (olivine forsterite mol % = 89 (Fo 89 ), spinel 100Cr/(Cr+Al) (Cr #) =10) to refractory harzburgites (Fo 93 , spinel Cr #=70) but also show diverse trace element characteristics in amphiboles and clinopyroxenes correlated with the major element behavior. Some of the most primitive lherzolites are from the Hayachine complex and contain a clinopyroxene with strongly light rare earth element (REE) depleted abundances. The slightly refractory aluminous spinel peridotites of the Miyamori complex forming kilometric blocks in chromian spinel peridotites, exhibit flat to weakly V-shaped REE patterns with lower heavy REE (HREE) abundances. The chromite-bearing peridotites of the Miyamori complex exhibit light REE (LREE) enriched patterns with further lower HREE abundances than the aluminous spinel peridotites. The most refractory clinopyroxene-free harzburgite (Fo 93 ) contains amphibole with the highest LREE/HREE ratio among the Miyamori-Hayachine peridotites. The observed covariance between major and trace elements together with geological and petrological data for the complex is reproduced with an open-system melting model, in which continuous supply of LREE-enriched melt, melting, and melt segregation are assumed to be coupled. Nonmodal melting with specified amounts of trapped melt is also taken into consideration. The result shows that REE and trace element data for less refractory peridotites can be reproduced fairly well by the model. Accounting for the REE patterns of more refractory peridotites, however, proved less tractable, indicative of the importance of a melting and melt separation process involving melt migration and reactions during the decompression of the mantle material."
flat earth,"We performed an experiment to study the thermal stability of metal on graphene. We show that Fe, Gd, Dy, and Eu on graphene exhibit island growth morphology. The 3D islands of Fe, Gd, and Dy show a small decrease in island density and an increase in the height/width aspect ratio upon thermal annealing. By contrast, coarsening of Eu islands to a close flat film is observed after annealing to 365 K. By investigating the fundamental interactions (i.e., adsorption energies and diffusion barriers) between the metal adatoms and graphene using ab initio calculations, we predict that most of the 3d and group 10 transition metals, noble metals, as well as rare earth metals on graphene should exhibit a 3D growth mode as observed in experiment. Most of the metal nanostructures on graphene should also be stable against aggregation. The 3D morphology and strong thermal stability of Fe, Co, Ni, Pt, and Gd islands on graphene can serve as good candidates for surface-supported catalysis applications."

The vehicle is a 10-ton armored personnel carrier modified for robotic control. A color transformation that best discriminates road and nonroad regions is derived from labeled data samples. A maximum-likelihood pixel classification technique is then used to classify pixels in the transformed color image. The vision system adapts itself to road changes in two ways; color transformation parameters are updated infrequently to accommodate significant road color changes, and classifier parameters are updated every processing cycle to deal with gradual color and intensity changes. To reduce unnecessary computation, only the most likely road region in the segmented image is selected, and a polygonal representation of the detected road region boundary is transformed from the image coordinate system to the local vehicle coordinate system based on a flat-earth assumption. >"
flat earth,"SUMMARY The late Holocene glacial moraine chronology in the southernmost South American Andes includes four 14C dated Neoglacial advances and retreats. These are used as proxy information to characterize mass fluctuation of the Patagonian icefields during the last 5000 years. Modelled ice loads force a phase-lagged viscoelastic gravitational deformation of the solid Earth. The ancient glacier fluctuations may, therefore, drive present-day crustal motion even in the absence of present-day ice mass imbalance. Numerical models show that such rates of present-day uplift and subsidence are larger than those driven by the viscous memory of late Pleistocene deglaciation. Both spherical and flat-earth models are employed, the latter being used to study exhaustively the eVects of glacial load history on the predicted vertical crustal velocity. Recent assessment of net mass balance from 1944 to 1985 indicates that the Southern Patagonian icefield has significantly deteriorated due to snout retreat and thinning. Volume loss rates are estimated at about 3.4‐9.3 km3 yr’1. The predicted vertical isostatic response to this recession and to the modelled Holocene Neoglaciations is at a marginally detectable level (# 1m m yr’1) if the mantle/asthenosphere beneath Patagonia has a viscosity of about 1021 Pa s. However, for reduced mantle viscosities, the younger Holocene glacial load histories predict larger signatures. In fact, if the viscosity is about 2◊1020 Pa s, or lower, then geodetically detectable vertical motion may be driven by a regional Little Ice Age (LIA) (1400‐1750 AD) glacier advance and subsequent 20th century retreat. Although this value for mantle viscosity is lower than thought typical of continental shield mantle (#1021 Pa s), it is consistent with inversions for post-seismic relaxation time constants in island arc environments and in regions with significant Neogene continental tectonism. In the viscosity regime of 5◊1018‐2◊1019 Pa s, the predicted rates of vertical crustal motion are similar to those presently occurring in Fennoscandia and Hudson Bay (5‐10 mm yr’1). Geodetic data may be sensitive to the time-integrated growth and subsequent retreat of Patagonian glacier ice mass over the last 600 years."
flat earth,"[1] We performed high-resolution (8 Hz) three-dimensional simulations of ground motions from shallow explosions in the presence of rough surface topography near the North Korean nuclear test site to study elastic propagation effects with emphasis on theoretical aspects of shear wave generation. Interaction with rough topography causes significant P-to-Rg scattering along the surface with amplification of high-frequency (2–8 Hz) shear waves relative to the flat Earth case. Shear waves of different polarizations are coupled by topographic scattering. Rg precursors composed of P-to-Rg conversions traveling as surface waves have the spectral amplitudes comparable to the P wave, while the Rg phase has the low-frequency (0.5–3 Hz) spectral shape of the Rg from the flat case plus the high-frequency (3–8 Hz) P wave spectra. Motions at near-vertical takeoff angles corresponding to teleseismic propagation are increased or decreased indicating that waves are focused or defocused by topographic features above the source. Topographic roughness has a dramatic effect as short-wavelength features (<2–5 km) are included. Higher frequencies are amplified by topography, including frequencies corresponding to wavelengths shorter than the shortest topographic scale length. Overall topography enhances energy propagating along the surface near the source, amplifies surface waves, and tends to balance SV- and SH-polarized motions, all of which impact shear wave observations used for nuclear explosion monitoring. Further simulation studies could elucidate how the wavefield emerging from a topographically rough area ultimately propagates to regional and/or teleseismic distances."
flat earth,"The oceanic crust fragments exposed in central America, in north-western South America, and in the Caribbean islands have been considered to represent accreted remnants of the Caribbean-Colombian Oceanic Plateau (CCOP). On the basis of trace element and Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic compositions we infer that cumulate rocks, basalts, and diabases from coastal Ecuador have a different source than the basalts from the Dominican Republic. The latter suite includes the 86 Ma basalts of the Duarte Complex which are light rare earth element (REE) -enriched and display (relative to normal mid-ocean ridge basalts, NMORB) moderate enrichments in large ion lithophile elements, together with high Nb, Ta, Pb, and low Th contents. Moreover, they exhibit a rather restricted range of Nd and Pb isotopic ratios consistent with their derivation from an ocean island-type mantle source, the composition of which includes the HIMU (high 238U/204Pb) component characteristic of the Galapagos hotspot. In contrast, the 123 Ma Ecuadorian oceanic rocks have flat REE patterns and (relative to NMORB) are depleted in Zr, Hf, Th, and U. Moreover, they show a wide range of Nd and Pb isotopic ratios intermediate between those of ocean island basalts and NMORB. It is unlikely, on geochemical grounds, that the plume source of the Ecuadorian fragments was similar to that of the Galapagos. In addition, because of the NNE motion of the Farallon plate during the Early Cretaceous, the Ecuadorian oceanic plateau fragments could not have been derived from the Galapagos hotspot but were likely formed at a ridge-centered or near-ridge hotspot somewhere in the SE Pacific."
flat earth,"Novice earth science students often have difficulty visualizing three-dimensional interpretations of flat, two-dimensional displays. This challenge becomes apparent when students attempt to comprehend topographic maps. In this study, we investigated conditions that influence such activity. Earth science students viewed standard topographic maps, maps that included shading, maps that included stereo visualization (affording a three-dimensional percept of the map), or maps with both stereo visualization and shading. Students answered line-of-sight questions (i.e., intervisibility tasks) while viewing their assigned map. These questions required students to visualize a route-perspective from the map's survey-perspective, with particular attention to the terrain relief. Tasks like this are routinely completed during topographic map experiences, and provide insight into a user's understanding of the dynamic land surfaces conveyed by those maps. Overall, stereo visualization was more successful than shading in facilitating students' completion of the task. Students' general performance was not influenced by gender, but was influenced by other background characteristics (e.g., expected course grades, prior map experience, and predilections for outdoors activity). Students also preferred maps employing three-dimensional cues more than maps without them. Classroom activities in the earth sciences may benefit from incorporating stereo visualizations into map-learning exercises."
flat earth,"Abstract. Solar radiation plays a key role in the Earth's energy balance and is used as an essential input data in radiation-based evapotranspiration (ET) models. Accurate gridded solar radiation data at high spatial and temporal resolution are needed to retrieve ET over large domains. In this work we present an evaluation at hourly, daily and monthly time steps and regional scale (Catalonia, NE Iberian Peninsula) of a satellite-based solar radiation product developed by the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility (LSA SAF) using data from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). Product performance and accuracy were evaluated for datasets segmented into two terrain classes (flat and hilly areas) and two atmospheric conditions (clear and cloudy sky), as well as for the full dataset as a whole. Evaluation against measurements made with ground-based pyranometers yielded good results in flat areas with an averaged model RMSE of 65 W m−2 (19%), 34 W m−2 (9.7%) and 21 W m−2 (5.6%), for hourly, daily and monthly-averaged solar radiation and including clear and cloudy sky conditions and snow or ice cover. Hilly areas yielded intermediate results with an averaged model RMSE (root mean square error) of 89 W m−2 (27%), 48 W m−2 (14.5%) and 32 W m−2 (9.3%), for hourly, daily and monthly time steps, suggesting the need of further improvements (e.g., terrain corrections) required for retrieving localized variability in solar radiation in these areas. According to the literature, the LSA SAF solar radiation product appears to have sufficient accuracy to serve as a useful and operative input to evaporative flux retrieval models."
flat earth,"We herein report the results of a ﬁeld study that was designed to test the feasibility of using ground‐based LIDAR to map the topography of a sand dune in high spatial resolution. A portable Cyrax 2500 three‐dimensional (3D) laser scanner was used to digitally capture the topography of a barchan, roughly 4 m tall and 50 m long, located in the White Sands National Monument, New Mexico. We performed eleven scans around the barchan and obtained the elevation relative to the inter‐dune ﬂat at roughly 1/4 million points on the dune surface. The elevation point data were then interpolated to yield a continuous surface model of the dune topography with c. 10 cm spatial resolution and c. 6 mm position accuracy. The results from this ﬁeld study clearly demonstrate the potential of ground‐based LIDAR as a mapping tool for use in aeolian research and other earth science applications. The 3D surface model of the dune can describe the morphology with hitherto unprecedented detail. Moreover, the surface of the dune is mapped with a minimum of foot trafﬁc on the dune itself.

flat earth,"The occurrence of cloud-to-ground flashes that effectively lower positive charge to earth (+CG flash) over flat terrain has been documented in the mature stage of severe thunderstorms. Of the 31 documented +CG flashes, most had only one return stroke. Zero-to-peak rise times for the strokes averaged 7 µs. The +CG flashes averaged 520 ms in duration, with 25 percent lasting more than 800 ms. Many of these had field changes suggestive of continuing current. Positive flashes have been observed to emanate from several regions of severe storms: high on the back of the main storm tower, through the wall cloud, and from the downshear anvil. Visually most of these positive flashes have emanated from high in the storm, and acoustic mapping of two shows thunder sources to a height of about 15 km."
flat earth,"Since the beginning of the 1990s, stable desert sites have been used for the calibration monitoring of many different sensors. Many attempts at sensor intercalibration have been also conducted using these stable desert sites. As a result, site characterization techniques and the quality of intercalibration techniques have gradually improved over the years. More recently, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites has recommended a list of reference pseudo-invariant calibration sites for frequent image acquisition by multiple agencies. In general, intercalibration should use well-known or spectrally flat reference. The reflectance profile of desert sites, however, might not be flat or well characterized (from a fine spectral point of view). The aim of this paper is to assess the expected accuracy that can be reached when using desert sites for intercalibration. In order to have a well-mastered estimation of different errors or error sources, this study is performed with simulated data from a hyperspectral sensor. Earth Observing-1 Hyperion images are chosen to provide the simulation input data. Two different cases of intercalibration are considered, namely, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus with Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Environmental Satellite MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) with Aqua MODIS. The simulation results have confirmed that intercalibration accuracy of 1% to 2% can be achieved between sensors, provided there are a sufficient number of available measurements. The simulated intercalibrations allow explaining results obtained during real intercalibration exercises and to establish some recommendations for the use of desert sites for intercalibration."

The equations are simply expressed with virtually no approximations based on angles referenced to the satellite. Earth rotation is included, as is the geosynchronous case. (These results differ from expressions to be found elsewhere in the literature, most of which have been derived using flat-Earth approximations.)."

flat earth,"PREFACEGeodetic satellites such as GEOSAT, SPOT, ERS-1, and TOPEX/Poseidon requireaccurate orbital computations to support the scientific data they collect. Until recently,gravity field mismodeling was the major source of error in precise orbit definition. How-ever, with recent improvements in these models, accurate modeling of the nonconser-vative forces has become a significant concern. In fact, the TOPEX/Poseidon missionrequirements dictate that the mismodeling of the nonconservative forces of solar radia-tion, Earth albedo and infrared re-radiation, and spacecraft thermal imbalances producein combination no more than a 6-cm radial rms error over a 10-day period. This re-quires the development of nonconservative force models which take the satellite'scomplex geometry, attitude, and surface properties into account. Specifically, forTOPEX/Poseidon, a ""box-wing"" satellite form has been investigated. This approachmodels the satellite as the combination of flat plates arranged in the shape of a box anda connected solar array. The nonconservative forces acting on each of the eight sur-faces are computed independently, yielding vector accelerations which are summed tocompute the total aggregate effect on the satellite center-of-mass. Parameters associ-ated with each flat plate are adjusted to obtain a better representation of the satelliteacceleration history. In order to test the validity of this concept, ""micro-models"" basedon finite element analysis of the TOPEX/Poseidon spacecraft have been used to gener-ate acceleration histories in a wide variety of orbit orientations. These accelerationsprofiles are compared to those from the ""box-wing"" model. Tests indicate that modelingsolar radiation pressure acceleration is relatively straightforward. However, the thermalimbalance modeling is made much more complicated given the satellite's complexattitude control law and its relation to the predicted temperature history for each surface.The results of these simulations and their implication on the ability to precisely modelthe TOPEX/Poseidon orbit will be discussed."
flat earth,"Summary 
 
Green sturgeon Acipenser medirostris from hatchery spawned wild-caught broodfish matured under aquaculture conditions. The first females (three out of four) matured at age 8 years, were successfully induced to ovulate by hormonal injections, and their eggs collected by caesarean surgery for fertilization. While the incision healed completely, unknown complications resulted in mortalities 5–12 months later. To minimize handling stress and to eliminate mortalities associated with surgery, a semi-natural tank spawning technique was used in subsequent years. A female was placed into a 3.7 m diameter flat-bottom circular fiberglass tank, depth 0.7 m, with two or three males, and the fish were injected with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) and white sturgeon pituitary extracts to induce spawning. Fuller’s Earth was continually added to the spawning tank using a belt feeder to minimize egg adhesion to other eggs and to the tank surfaces. The tank was checked hourly for oviposition, and the eggs collected using a fine mesh dip net, every 1–3 h. Spawning lasted 15–21 h, and 53–80 000 eggs were collected from individual spawning females. Direct observation of spawning activity was not possible because of the high turbidity caused by Fuller’s Earth. However, the female and males occasionally breached at the water surface and appeared to be interacting. After oviposition was completed, viable milt was collected from all males, and fertilization success ranged from 7% to 83% in five spawning events. Over three consecutive years (2009–2011) all five females and 11 males used in semi-natural tank spawning ovulated or spermiated, and were not subject to post-spawning mortality. The relatively slow deposition of eggs and the continuous addition of Fuller’s Earth minimized the adhesion of eggs into large clumps. While the egg fertility and hatchability varied greatly among individual females, the tank spawning technique presented a feasible alternative to other more invasive methods for obtaining fertilized eggs of green sturgeon, and may be applicable for other sturgeons, particularly endangered species."
flat earth,"Summary. A normal mode superposition approach is used to synthesize complete seismic codas for flat layered earth models and the P-SV phases. Only modes which have real eigenwavenumbers are used so that the search for eigenvalues in the complex wavenumber plane is confined to the real axis. In order to synthesize early P-wave arrivals by summing a number of‘trapped’modes, an anomalously high velocity cap layer is added to the bottom of the structure so that most of the seismic energy is contained in the upper layers as high-order surface waves. Causality arguments are used to define time windows for which the resulting synthetic seismograms are close approximations to the exact solutions without the cap layer. The traditional Thomson—Haskell matrix approach to computing the normal modes is reformulated so that numerical problems encountered at high frequencies are avoided and numerical results of the locked mode approximation are given."
flat earth,"[1] Using two conjunction events of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) imagers and spacecraft as well as the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radars, we show that longitudinally narrow flow bursts in the nightside polar cap can precede poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) that are followed by equatorward moving north-south (N-S) arcs, including those leading to substorm onset instability within the near-Earth plasma sheet. The association between the ionospheric flows and PBIs indicates that enhanced flows on open field lines may contribute to parallel potential drop increase, triggering of magnetotail reconnection, and to the earthward flows leading to N-S arcs and to substorm onset. We also investigated differences between N-S arc sequences that do and do not lead to substorm expansion onset. We found that the two types of N-S arcs have similar characteristics, indicating that their corresponding plasma sheet flow properties could also be similar. There is, however, one difference between the sequences of N-S arc evolution. Each N-S arc leads to small intensification of the growth phase arc, and when the onset-related N-S arc reaches the equatorward portion of the auroral oval, the preexisting growth phase arc is much brighter than at the times of non-onset-related N-S arcs. Assuming that the growth phase arc is related to pressure gradients at the inner edge of the plasma sheet, this difference indicates that the near-Earth plasma pressure distribution at the time of plasma sheet fast flows is crucial in substorm triggering. These observations suggest that substorm onset instability is possible only when the preexisting inner plasma sheet pressure is sufficiently large."
flat earth,"This is a powerful and a thrilling narrative history revealing the roots of modern science in the medieval world. The adjective 'medieval' has become a synonym for brutality and uncivilized behavior. Yet without the work of medieval scholars there could have been no Galileo, no Newton and no Scientific Revolution. In ""God's Philosophers"", James Hannam debunks many of the myths about the Middle Ages, showing that medieval people did not think the earth is flat, nor did Columbus 'prove' that it is a sphere; the Inquisition burnt nobody for their science nor was Copernicus afraid of persecution; no Pope tried to ban human dissection or the number zero. ""God's Philosophers"" is a celebration of the forgotten scientific achievements of the Middle Ages - advances which were often made thanks to, rather than in spite of, the influence of Christianity and Islam. Decisive progress was also made in technology: spectacles and the mechanical clock, for instance, were both invented in thirteenth-century Europe. Charting an epic journey through six centuries of history, ""God's Philosophers"" brings back to light the discoveries of neglected geniuses like John Buridan, Nicole Oresme and Thomas Bradwardine, as well as putting into context the contributions of more familiar figures like Roger Bacon, William of Ockham and Saint Thomas Aquinas."
flat earth,"Paterae, defined by the International Astronomical Union as “irregular crater[s], or complex one[s] with scalloped edges,” are some of the most prominent topographic features on Io. Paterae on Io are unique, yet in some aspects they resemble calderas known and studied on Earth, Mars, and Venus. They have steep walls, flat floors, and arcuate margins and sometimes exhibit nesting, all typical of terrestrial and Martian basalt shield calderas. However, they are much larger, many are irregular in shape, and they typically lack shields. Their great sizes (some >200 km diameter) and lack of associated volcanic edifices beg comparison with terrestrial ash flow calderas; however, there is no convincing evidence on Io for the high-silica erupted products or dome resurgence associated with this type of caldera. Ionian paterae seem to be linked with the eruption of large amounts of mafic to ultramafic lavas and colorful sulfur-rich materials that cover the floors and sometimes flow great distances away from patera margins. They are often angular in shape or are found adjacent to mountains or plateaus, indicating tectonic influences on their formation. A database of 417 paterae on Io measured from images with <3.2 km pixel−1 resolution (80% of its surface) reveals that their mean diameter of 41.0 km is close to that for calderas of Mars (47.7 km), is smaller than that for Venus (∼68 km), but dwarfs those for terrestrial basalt shield calderas (6.6 km) and ash flow calderas (18.7 km). Thirteen percent of all paterae are found adjacent to mountains, 42% have straight or irregular margins, and 8% are found atop low shields. Abundant, smaller paterae with more continuously active lava eruptions are found between 25°S and 25°N latitude, whereas fewer and larger paterae are found poleward of these latitudes. Patera distribution shows peaks at 330°W and 150°W longitude, likely related to the direction of greatest tidal massaging by Jupiter. Ionian patera formation may be explained by portions or combinations of models considered for formation of terrestrial calderas, yet their unusual characteristics may require new models with a greater role for tectonic processes."
flat earth,"Abstract We report 8510-MHz (3.5-cm) radar observations of the Earth-crossing asteroid (ECA) 6489 Golevka (1991 JX) obtained between June 3 and June 15, 1995, at Goldstone, the Very Large Array and the Evpatoria (Ukraine) and Kashima (Japan) radio antennas. One-dimensional Doppler spectra are used to estimate the object's convex hull, refine the ephemeris, and yield four possible pole directions. Three-dimensional modeling using two-dimensional delay-Doppler images and published lightcurves unambiguously defines the pole and reveals an extraordinarily angular shape with flat sides, sharp edges and corners, and peculiar concavities. The equivalent diameter of the object is 530±30 m, with moments of inertia about the (long, intermediate, short) axes proportional to (1.00, 1.38, 1.39) ±0.1. The asteroid's pole direction is λ=202±5°, β=−45±5°, and its sidereal period is P=6.0289±0.0001 h. The asteroid's circular polarization ratio, SC/OC=0.23±0.02, is lower than the average for radar-detected near-Earth asteroids and reveals only a modest degree of near-surface roughness at scales near the 3.5-cm wavelength. However, the approximately Lambertian radar scattering law implies considerable surface roughness at larger scales. The asteroid's radar scattering law is modeled as ρcosnθ, with ρ=0.25±0.12 and n=1.7±0.7 giving an equivalent spherical albedo of 0.18±0.09. This value is in the middle of the distribution of albedos of S-class asteroid's previously imaged by radar. The Hapke parameters describing the object's optical scattering properties are w=0.173±0.006, h=0.024±0.012, B0=1.03±0.45, g=−0.34±0.02, and θ =20±5°. Both the optical and the radar scattering properties are consistent with those of a typical S-class asteroid. Goldstone-VLA plane-of-sky images do not resolve the asteroid but do provide astrometry with uncertainties less than 0.1 arcsec. Integration of an orbit based on all available radar and optical astrometry shows that Golevka has an insignificant probability of collision with any planet during at least the next nine centuries. We investigate Golevka's dynamical environment, assuming uniform density. Some areas of the surface are characterized by large enough slopes that we expect that they are exposed, solid, monolithic rock."

Laboratory experiments with phase modulation screens, as well as the resultant intensity distributions due to point source are demonstrated. The experimental method to freeze the speckles, as well as data processing techniques for both Fourier modulus and Fourier phase are described.

flat earth,"There was a time when nearly everybody who was anybody among Western cognoscenti knew that the world was flat. All the maps showed it, the scientists confirmed it, and the church preached it. Anyone who nonetheless proposed sailing westward from Europe to reach India found himself without resources to undertake a voyage expected to lead to a disastrous drop off the edge of the flat earth. Anyone daring to even question the established paradigm about the shape of the world risked excommunication from the church and eternal damnation. Came Christopher Columbus! He was able to convince the Queen of Spain that testing the accuracy of prevailing geography paradigms was worth modest funding for ships and crews. The rest is history, familiar to all of us. Columbus’ trip proved that the earth is round. Still, it took a very long time before the scholarly community, the church, and the proverbial men in the street were willing and psychologically able to tolerate, accept, and finally embrace the paradigm switch. John Zaller is no Christopher Columbus. In fact, to carry out the analogy, he is probably more like some of the early converts who embraced the new, empirically grounded, round-earth paradigm ahead of the crowd. “A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen” puts Zaller squarely into a small camp of iconoclastic scholars. These scholars have been laboring to bury the unsustainable belief that democracy requires citizens who fully understand all major policy issues and a press that supplies them with all of the necessary information. As a long-time member of the iconoclast group, I welcome John Zaller with open arms. I share his belief that American democracy can thrive even though American citizens (and citizens in other Western democracies as well) cannot and will not be held to the standards of the “Informed Citizen,” as Michael Schudson (1998) describes the breed. Full knowledge about all major political issues has become impossible. There is simply too much to know and most of it is extraordinarily complex, requiring technical, managerial, and political expertise beyond the reach of most citizens. I agree with Zaller and like-minded scholars that good citizenship in the 21st century requires a new paradigm and that the “Monitorial Citizen” serves the purpose quite well. That paradigm takes into account that most citizens lead complex lives in which civic duties are one of many pressing claims for each person’s attention. Given the strain on most citizens’ attention resources, it is also clear that the database that citizens"
flat earth,"Abstract— We report on major and trace element analyses obtained by, respectively, inductively coupled plasma‐atomic emission spectrometry (ICP‐AES) and inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) of three different aliquots of the new Saharan shergottite Dar al Gani (DaG) 476. The new analyses are in excellent agreement with previous data (Zipfel et al., 2000). Ba, Sr and U abundances, together with the presence of carbonate, suggest that the sample has been significantly weathered. Three rare earth element (REE) patterns (normalized to CI) determined on three different aliquots of the sample all show similar shapes. The heavy REEs are flat with a slight depletion at the heavy end and a strong depletion from Dy to Pr. All of the patterns display an upturn to La which we interpret as being caused by the introduction of a terrestrial component. Taking the terrestrial contamination into account, this study demonstrates that DaG 476 is one of the most depleted of the shergottites, and, just like Queen Alexandra Range (QUE) 94201 (Dreibus et al., 1996), displays very low Zr/Hf ratios. It appears that the Zr/Hf ratios of shergottites are not uniform, and have been significantly fractionated by martian mantle processes."
flat earth,"New geochemical and paleomagnetic results are presented on two Late Cretaceous dikes of the 85–90 Ma leucogabbroic and doleritic dikes and the 65–70 Ma dolerites in Kerala, India. The dikes are rich in incompatible elements, have fractionated patterns with light rare-earth element enrichment and are akin geochemically to Cretaceous basalts on the east coast of Madagascar. The magmas were formed at garnet lherzolite depths above the Marion plume, constituting part of a large igneous province in Madagascar. In contrast, the 65–70 Ma dolerites are moderately depleted in incompatible elements, with almost flat, rare-earth element patterns and resemble the upper formations of the Deccan Traps and the tholeiitic dikes of the Seychelles. These dolerites were formed by melting of spinel lherzolite over the Reunion plume. Paleomagnetic data from the dikes and the other coeval igneous units from south India provide the 90 Ma pole (latitude: 24°; longitude: 293°; A 95 = 5.9; N = 18 sites) for India. The 65–70 Ma dolerites possess both normal and reverse polarities, and the mean pole (latitude: 36°; longitude: 283°; A 95 = 5.7°; N = 10 sites) compares well with the Deccan superpole. Paleolatitude estimates indicate ∼5° southward migration for the Marion plume and a northward migration for the Reunion plume, in conformity with global mantle-circulation models; however, distinguishing migration of the Reunion plume from the effects of true polar wander is difficult. Furthermore, the geodynamic reconstructions extending the shear zones of southern Madagascar into south India are not tenable."
flat earth,"From magnetic systems to the crust of the earth, many physical systems that exhibit a multiplicity of metastable states emit pulses with a broad power law distribution in energy. Digital audio recordings reveal that paper being crumpled, which can be easily held in hand, is such a system. Crumpling paper both using the traditional hand method and a cylindrical geometry uncovered a power law distribution of pulse energies spanning over two decades: {ital p}({ital E})={ital E}{sup {alpha}}, {alpha}=1.3{minus}1.6, with clearly nonexponential distribution over three decades. Crumpling initially flat sheets into a compact ball (strong crumpling), we found little or no evidence that the energy distribution varied systematically over time or the size of the sheet. When we applied repetitive small deformations (weak crumpling) to sheets which had been previously folded along a regular grid, we found no systematic dependence on the grid spacing. Our results suggest that the pulse energy depends only weakly on the size of paper regions responsible for sound production. {copyright} {ital 1996 The American Physical Society.}"
flat earth,"One of the largest solar hard X-ray (HXR) flares and solar energetic particle (SEP) events recorded by the Mars Odyssey mission while orbiting Mars occurred on 2002 October 27 and is related to a very fast (~2300 km s-1) coronal mass ejection (CME). From the Earth, the flare site is 40.4° ± 3.5° behind the solar limb and only emissions from the high corona at least 1.5 × 105 km radially above the main flare site can be seen. Nevertheless, the Earth-orbiting Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observed HXR emission up to 60 keV with a relatively flat, nonthermal spectrum (γ between 3 and 3.5) that has an onset simultaneous with the main HXR emission observed above 60 keV by the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) orbiting Mars. While GRS records several smaller enhancements after the main peak, the high coronal source observed by RHESSI shows a long exponential decay (τ = 135 ± 5 s) with progressive spectral hardening. The emissions from the high corona originate from an extended source (~1.5 × 105 km in diameter) that expands (390 ± 70 km s-1) and moves upwards (750 ± 80 km s-1) in the same direction as the CME. These observations reveal the existence of energetic electrons in the high corona in closed magnetic structures related to the CME that are accelerated at the same time as the main energy release in the flare. Although the number of energetic electrons in the high corona is only a small fraction of the total accelerated electrons, about 10% of all electrons in the high coronal source are nonthermal (>10 keV)."
flat earth,"Infragravity waves (IGWs) play an important role in coupling wave processes in the ocean, ice shelves, atmosphere, and the solid Earth. Due to the paucity of experimental data, little quantitative information is available about power spectra of IGWs away from the shore. Here we use continuous, yearlong records of pressure at 28 locations on the seafloor off New Zealand's South Island to investigate spectral and spatial distribution of IGW energy. Dimensional analysis of diffuse IGW fields reveals universal properties of the power spectra observed at different water depths and leads to a simple, predictive model of the IGW spectra. While sources of IGWs off New Zealand are found to have a flat power spectrum, the IGW energy density has a pronounced dependence on frequency and local water depth as a result of the interaction of the waves with varying bathymetry."
flat earth,"Distinct equilibration temperatures, deformation and trace element characteristics are observed in amphibole-bearing and amphibole-free peridotite xenoliths from Nushan, Sino-Korean Craton, eastern China. Amphibole-free peridotites are predominantly deformed, fine-grained ( 1 mm) and equilibrated at 990---1110 C. Their cpx are characterized by either light rare earth element (LREE)-depleted or relatively flat REE patterns with only a slight depletion in high field strength elements (HFSE). LREE enrichment is generally associated with Fe-rich samples, consistent with `wall-rock' metasomatism adjacent to basaltic veins. In contrast, amphibole-bearing peridotites are less deformed, coarse-grained (43 mm) and display chemical zonation in the pyroxenes suggesting cooling from 1050 to 850 C. Their cpx show a large variation in LREE (Cen  1 7---68) and almost constant heavy rare earth element (HREE) contents (Ybn  9 8---11 6). The highest LREE contents occur in cpx from amphibole-rich samples, coupled with Fe enrichment, strong enrichment in Th and U, and marked depletion in the HFSE. These characteristics may be accounted for by combined `wall-rock' and `diffuse' metasomatism involving an agent rich in volatiles and incompatible elements. As such the Nushan xenoliths could represent samples from two spatially separate metasomatic aureoles. Conversely, the cryptic and modal metasomatism could be genetically related, because the amphibole-peridotites and Fe-rich amphibole-free samples show similar Sr---Nd isotopic ranges that are indistinguishable from those of the Cenozoic basalts from eastern China. The different metasomatic assemblage and the trace element composition can be accounted for in terms of P---T control on amphibole stability and progressive chemical evolution of asthenosphere-derived melts during upward migration. Trace element signatures and metasomatic assemblages, together with the fertile composition of the Nushan peridotites, suggest an origin as newly accreted lithosphere rather than as relic cratonic mantle. Metasomatism may have occurred after late Mesozoic lithospheric thinning, which marked a dramatic change in lithospheric architecture beneath the Sino-Korean Craton."
flat earth,"A variety of uniform lanthanide orthoborates LnBO(3) (Ln = Gd, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy) microplates have been successfully prepared by a general and facile conversion method. One-dimensional (ID) lanthanide hydroxides were first prepared through a simple hydrothermal process. Subsequently, uniform LnBO(3) microplates were synthesized at the expense of the ID precursors during a hydrothermal conversion process. The whole process in this method was carried out in aqueous condition without the use of any organic solvents, surfactant, or catalyst. The as-obtained rare earth ions doped GdBO3 and TbBO3 microplates show strong light emissions with different colors coming from different activator ions under ultraviolet excitation or low-voltage electron beam excitation, which might find potential applications in fields such as light phosphor powders and advanced flat panel display devices."

Observed and calculated results are therefore usually normalized, either against maximum or free-space values, or against values obtained above a non-penetrable flat Earth. This is acceptable and useful because excitation differences become negligible at long ranges. Today's interests and priorities in propagation modeling have shifted to quite short ranges, which necessitates accurate source modeling. Short-range propagation problems, modeling, and simulation challenges and accurate source modeling, are discussed, and several useful MATLAB codes are presented."
flat earth,"A Ku/Ka band dual-frequency offset array-fed microstrip reflectarray antenna using thin membranes has been developed. This antenna is a demonstration model for the next generation titan cloud precipitation radar and altimeter (TCPRA) and is intended to enhance the capability of the future cloud and precipitation remote sensing system for Earth and other planets. The reflectarray has a dimension of 0.5-m square and a flat aperture that emulates a cylindrical reflector antenna. Two sets of linear arrays with linearly polarized microstrip elements and having low cross polarization and low sidelobe levels (SLL) are placed along the focal line to illuminate the reflectarray. One set is for Ku-band, while the other is for Ka-band. Within each set, the wide-swath scanning capability of the antenna is provided by the two fixed-beam feed arrays with one for broadside beam and the other one for a 20deg tilted beam. The unique feature of this paper is that this is the first offset-fed reflectarray that has ever been practically developed to emulate a cylindrical/parabolic type of reflector antenna. In addition, new dual-concentric-ring elements and ring-patch elements are uniquely applied here to achieve the desirable wide phase variation characteristics. Tests of feed arrays and the reflectarray in the anechoic chamber of Texas A&M University result in good pattern performance and the successful demonstration of beam scanning at both frequency bands."
flat earth,"Is the Earth flat? Obviously it is, just look beneath your feet. And yet, if the pictures from space are to be believed, it is round and international travel confirms this every day. We know (or at least believe) the Earth is round, but for practical everyday purposes, we behave as if it is flat. Too often we become ‘flat Earth thinkers’ simplifying too much when we need to see the fuller picture."
flat earth,"The main purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the important but long neglected problem of electrical coupling between the ionosphere and the lower atmosphere. A numerical technique is used to calculate electric fields and currents between 0- and 150-km altitude produced by large-scale horizontal electric fields known to exist in the polar cap and auroral ionosphere. A two-dimensional model assuming a flat earth and a vertical geomagnetic field is used. The results show that horizontal electric fields in the ionosphere map down to ∼ 10 km with little attenuation, in agreement with previous authors' results. In addition, these horizontal ionospheric electric fields should cause significant modulations of vertical electric fields down to the earth's surface. The effects of conductivity irregularities in the ionosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere are also examined. Localized conductivity enhancements associated with aurora are expected to produce a horizontal electric field of up to a few millivolts per meter at ∼30-km altitude in the absence of any horizontal field in the ionosphere. These conductivity enhancements have less than a 1% effect on the vertical electric field on the ground. The effects of stratospheric and tropospheric irregularities are negligible at large heights but become important below ∼20 km. Their magnitude depends on how the ratio between the local resistivity and the height-integrated columnar resistance is altered."
flat earth,"Garnet peridotites from the Kokchetav ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) massif contain abundant volatile and high field strength element (HFSE) bearing minerals, such as Ti-clinohumite and zircon. These characteristics are interpreted to be related to fluid-infiltrated mantle metasomatism from the oceanic lithosphere that had been subducted below the area. The zircons from the peridotites were dated by using sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) and yielded apparent U-Pb ages of 554–494 Ma (weighted mean age, 528 Ma) that are mostly consistent with the timing of UHP metamorphism deduced from diamond-bearing country rocks in this massif. These zircons have an almost flat rare earth element (REE) pattern and very low REE concentrations; these characteristics are similar to those observed in kimberlitic zircons. Inherited zircon cores, although only rarely preserved, yielded apparently Proterozoic ages and have different trace element characteristics compared to the overgrowth rims. These features indicate that the mantle metasomatic events and the recrystallization of Ti-clinohumite and zircon were due to HFSE-enriched fluid infiltration during the UHP metamorphism at great depths. The metasomatized mantle may have been transported farther into the deep upper mantle and contributed to the source of intraplate magmas such as kimberlites and alkali basalts, because these rocks have characteristically high volatile and HFSE concentrations such as those of the Ti-clinohumite–bearing garnet peridotites."
flat earth,"The measure of central tendency that Gould refers to is typically the average, also known as the expected value, and the mistakes he warns of result from a common fallacy as fundamental as the belief that the Earth is flat. It permeates planning activities in business, government and the military. It helped mask the recent subprime mortgage fiasco until it became a world crisis, and it will plague those trying to clean up the mess. It's even enshrined within accounting codes."
flat earth,"Information about the nature of the UV absorbing agents in Venus' atmosphere has been obtained from a comparison of model predictions with a variety of photometric data obtained from the Pioneer Venus probes and orbiter as well as from the earth. The theoretical simulations were performed with numerically accurate radiative transfer codes that incorporated spacecraft constraints on the properties of aerosols and gases in Venus' atmosphere. We find that at least two UV absorbers are needed: gaseous SO2, which is a major source of opacity at wavelengths shortward of 0.32 µm, and a second absorber, which dominates above 0.32 µm. The concentration of the second absorber increases sharply with increasing optical depth within the first few optical depths and then has a relatively flat profile throughout most of the remainder of the upper main cloud layer; but it is largely absent from the middle and lower cloud regions. Several mechanisms appear to be responsible for producing UV contrast features. These include changes in the optical depth of the upper haze layer, which leads to brightness differences between equatorial and polar regions, and changes in the depth over which the second UV absorber is depleted in the uppermost part of the main clouds, which creates UV features at equatorial latitudes. Atmospheric dynamics acts as a driving force for the above variations in the radiative properties of the clouds through dynamically induced temperature changes and changes in vertical mixing. Many UV-absorbing materials, including sulfur, various iron compounds, and nitrogen dioxide gas, have spectral absorption properties that are in serious disagreement with those deduced for the second UV absorber. One possibly tenable candidate for the second absorber is gaseous Cl2, whose spectral absorption characteristics closely match the empirically derived ones and whose expected altitude profile is crudely consistent with the sharp decreases in the concentration of the second absorber near the cloud tops and bottom of the upper clouds. Approximately 1 ppm of Cl2 is required. Whether this amount of Cl2 can be generated from the photodissociation of HCl is not clear, with the peak Cl2 mixing ratio being strongly dependent on the exact amount of HCl and other gases that are present in the upper clouds."
flat earth,"Abstract The İspendere ophiolite forms part of the Tauride active continental margin assemblage in SE Anatolia. The ophiolite exhibits an intact oceanic lithosphere section and is intruded by Late Cretaceous calc-alkaline granites. The ophiolite comprises mantle tectonites, ultramafic to mafic cumulates, isotropic gabbros, isolated diabase dykes, a sheeted dyke complex, plagiogranite and volcanic rocks. The volcanics and the sheeted dyke complex exhibit (1) similar rare earth element patterns, with flat to light rare earth element depletion (La–Yb)N=0.71–1.14 and 0.65–1.22, (2) negative Nb anomalies and (3) flat-lying high field strength element trends. These features differ from a typical Normal--Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt fractionation trend and could have resulted from c. 15% partial melting of a previously depleted mantle source. The whole-rock chemistry and the mineral chemistry of the ultramafic to mafic cumulates [high Ca plagioclases (An89–81), magnesian olivines (Fo88–81) and clinopyroxenes (Mg#90–83)] show that the primary magma of the plutonic suite is compositionally similar to modern island arc tholeiites. The available evidence suggests that the İspendere ophiolite formed at a northerly supra-subduction zone spreading centre of the Southern Neotethys, between the Taurides and the Bitlis–Pütürge metamorphic units, during the Late Cretaceous. Comparison with the adjacent Göksun, Kömürhan and Guleman ophiolites suggests that the İspendere ophiolite represents part of a single regional-scale sheet of oceanic lithosphere that was accreted to the base of Tauride active continental margin where it was cut by arc-type magmatic rocks."
flat earth,"The need for effective and reliable methods to survey and monitor the structure of earth-fill dams recently became pressing in light of the increasing number of flood events in central Europe. Among geophysical techniques, dam imaging using electrical resistivity methods is applied in most cases. Occasionally, ground-penetrating radar is applied in the framework of the search for subsurface facilities. Seismic methods are rarely used. 
This paper focuses on the multichannel analysis of the surface waves (MASW) method to determine dynamic soil properties and aims to extend its application field to dyke and dam structures. The standard processing procedure of the MASW assumes a flat free surface of infinite extension. The flat surfaces of a dyke, in contrast, are in the order of 1–10 times smaller than the wavelengths in the soil; disturbing side reflections will occur. Even though MASW has already been applied on a few dyke sites, the effect of such an obvious breach of preconditions needs to be studied before the method can be recommended. 
In this paper the influences of the dyke’s topography on the test results are studied by means of a numerical analysis. Typical cross-sections are modelled using 2.5D finite and boundary elements. The results of models taking the topography into account are compared with models neglecting the topography. The differences are evaluated on the level of the dispersion curves and for one cross-section on the level of the S-wave velocity. They were found to be insignificant for dykes with a width-to-height ratio larger than four. 
A testing campaign was conducted providing the chance to collect experience in the practical use of the MASW method on dykes. Test results obtained at two test sites are selected and compared to the results of borehole logs and cone penetration tests. A remarkable relation between the S-wave velocity and the consistency of the clay sealing was found at one site; a distinct positive correlation to the measured cone tip resistances was achieved on the other test site. Valuable information on the composition of the dyke body and base could be obtained but the resolution of the method to identify small areas of inhomogeneity should not be overestimated."
flat earth,"Total atmospheric attenuation under conditions of complete and partial cloud cover was measured at frequencies of 15 and 35 GHz in the Boston area. The attenuations were actually inferred from extinction measurements using the Sun as a source. Measurements were made at 29 elevation angles from 1 degrees to 20 degrees , and the angular dependence of the attenuation was examined. For most cloud conditions the attenuation was found to be proportional to the slant path distance through the absorbing atmosphere. For elevation angles above about 8 degrees , a flat Earth approximation is valid and the slant path distance is proportional to the cosecant of the elevation angle. For low elevation angles the slant path distance is a function of the effective earth radius and the effective height of the attenuating atmosphere, in addition to the elevation angle. A statistical technique for determining the radius and height is described. A zenith attenuation was extrapolated from each set of data. The humidity and frequency dependence of the attenuation was examined. An algorithm for estimating total atmospheric attenuation as a function of elevation angle, frequency, and surface absolute humidity was derived. >"
flat earth,"Several measurements of vertical ground motion at Pinon Flat Observatory, California, indicate the overall weakness and instability of the Earth's weathered surface with respect to the underlying rock. Cumulative long-period motions of order 0.5 mm per year dominate these records, though smaller elastic deformations caused by precipitation loading, atmospheric loading, and tidal strains are evident at higher frequencies; all of these help to characterize the near-surface material. The long-period records suggest that near-surface weathering is the dominant influence on monument motion, at least at this site on crystalline rock in a semi-arid environment. Rainfall loading gives an average vertical modulus of 2.6 GPa for the material in the uppermost 26 m of the ground, compared with 88 GPa for granite under moderate confining stress; atmospheric loading gives similar results but indicates the ground is permeable to airflow at periods longer than a few hours. Earth tide records show Poisson's ratio to be 0.09 in contrast to the normative range of 0.2–0.25, establishing that horizontal strains couple only weakly into vertical ones, so that vertical strains near the surface are a poor measure of areal strain. The form of the ground-surface displacement power spectrum indicates that analyses of geodetic surveys would be improved with the inclusion of a monument-positioning error budget that increases with time. Because of ground instability, and the generally small rate of crustal tectonic motions, deeply emplaced monuments will be needed for observational programs designed to detect short-term changes in crustal deformation over baselengths of order 10 km and less."
flat earth,"The facility location problem (FLP) consists of finding the best location for a facility (service center) to efficiently meet the demands of client points. Studies on the FLP have considered flat or spherical surfaces for computation of distances between these entities. However, the Earth’s surface is not flat or perfectly spherical. This article considers the ellipsoid as a more appropriate model of the Earth’s surface and adapts the FLP to address this assumption. The optimization of the adapted FLP was performed using Solver. Results on geographic instances provided important insights about the logistic financial aspect of the ellipsoid assumption."
flat earth,"RapidEye AG is a commercial provider of geo-spatial information products derived from Earth observation image data. The source of this data is the RapidEye constellation of five low-earth-orbit imaging satellites. Image data from satellite electro-optical sensors contains spatial artifacts such as banding and streaking that are caused by detector responsivity variations, factors related to image formation, and the space environment. This paper describes the results of a relative radiometric calibration and correction campaign that was conducted between March and July 2011 using the side-slither technique. Radiometrically uniform terrestrial scenes that included desert and snow/ice regions were imaged with a RapidEye sensor in a ninety-degree yaw orbital configuration. In this configuration each detector on the focal plane was positioned parallel to the ground-track direction thereby exposing each detector to the light reflected from the same segment of the ground. This maneuver produced a radiometrically flat-field input to the sensor so that the relative response of each detector was determined for the same exposure level. Side-slither derived detector correction parameters were then used to improve the quality of RapidEye imagery that contained noticeable spatial artifacts. A significant improvement in image correction was achieved when compared to our standard correction procedures."
flat earth,"Measurements of tectonic deformation depend on both accurate instrumentation and adequate coupling of the apparatus to the earth's crust. Existing techniques, capable of resolving the signals of interest (strain rates of 10 n/yr), are mainly observatory based. The limitation in the baselength of these instruments (---1 km) results in a requirement that the reference monuments be exceptionally stable (10 tzm/yr). However, records from Pition Flat Observatory, California, show that the actual horizontal displacements for massive near surface monuments, eraplaced in competent, weathered granite, are of the order of 50 tzm/yr. The low noise level of the strain measurements at this site indicates that this magnitude of monument displacement is abnormally small. Until high-accuracy geodetic techniques are developed, sophisticated monuments (or monument monitoring devices) will be necessary to record faithfully continuous crustal deformation."
flat earth,"The ``warp drive'' metric recently presented by Alcubierre has the problem that an observer at the center of the warp bubble is causally separated from the outer edge of the bubble wall. Hence such an observer can neither create a warp bubble on demand nor control one once it has been created. In addition, such a bubble requires negative energy densities. One might hope that elimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that, although the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In our four-dimensional extension of this metric, a ``tube'' is constructed along the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star. Inside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to allow superluminal travel in one direction. We show that, although a single Krasnikov tube does not involve closed timelike curves, a time machine can be constructed with a system of two nonoverlapping tubes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Krasnikov tubes, like warp bubbles and traversable wormholes, also involve unphysically thin layers of negative energy density, as well as large total negative energies, and, therefore, probably cannot be realized in practice."
flat earth,"Although the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technique has the potential for monitoring ground deformation with millimetric accuracy, it still suffers from temporal and geometric decorrelation. In this paper, the corner reflectors differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (CRDInSAR) technique was used to overcome the limitations of conventional DInSAR. We studied the basic principles of CRDInSAR, discussed the calculation of the flat earth and topographic phases based on the geometry of satellite and corner reflectors, presented the phase unwrapping approach for the sparse grid of corner reflectors, then investigated the construction of, and solution to, the unwrapped phase system equation. Subsequently, we applied CRDInSAR to monitor the displacement of the Shuping landslide in Hubei Province, China. In this study, we processed five SAR images on a descending pass acquired by the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) sensor from September 2005 to March 2006, and compared the achieved results of CRDInSAR with Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements at the same time of the SAR data acquisition assumed as reference. The result indicates a good agreement between the measurements provided by the two different techniques, which shows that CRDInSAR allows monitoring of slow landslide deformation in low coherence areas and provides accurate results."

In addition, axial-gap structure has possibility of effective utilization of in-wheel flat motor space. This paper mainly discusses the design and the characteristics of axial-gap SR motors. This study focuses on the volumetric constrains of in-wheel drive system. First, the results of comparing the axialgap SR motors specification to the radial-gap one at same volume are shown that utilize the available active volume. By the results, a new flat volume axial-gap SR motor for in-wheel direct-drive EV is designed. Finally, a new support link structure is proposed for the large axial direction electromagnetic force of axial-gap SR motor."
flat earth,"The differential InSAR technique has the potential for monitoring centimetre-scale ground motion in an accurate and cost-effective manner. Probably the most important limiting factor in the application of InSAR is temporal change in the complex reflectivity of the ground surface during the period between radar acquisitions. This can be due to changes in such parameters as moisture content or vegetation. The stable artificial corner reflectors can be identified from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images even with large baselines and therefore decrease the risk of image decorrelation. In this paper we will discuss the following questions: (1) how to get the true phase of a corner reflector in a SAR complex image; (2) how to co-register the corner reflector pixels, if the coherence of its surrounding area is extremely low; (3) how to computer the interferometric phase of two co-registered corner reflectors without flat Earth term and corners' height contribution. In order to demonstrate the results some practical examples Bonn-Experiment and landslide monitoring in Three Gorges area in China are given."
flat earth,"Summary. A model is developed to describe the effects of local and global atmospheric pressure fluctuations on local gravity. The calculated admittance of gravity to the pressure tides S1-S4 at Pinon Flat, California is compared to those measured using the superconducting gravimeter. The theoretical and measured admittances are in good agreement for the S3 and S4 tides. The difference between theory and observation at S2 can probably be explained by the ocean tide at that frequency while the discrepancy at S1 remains unexplained. Techniques for the removal of random pressure variations from gravity records are described. Using statistics derived from spherical harmonic decompositions of the Earth's pressure field, it is shown that more than 80 per cent of the pressure induced gravity variations should be removed from a gravity record by employing a single barometer and least-squares procedure. It is further shown that adding a ring of barometers should increase the effectiveness to about 90 per cent. The amount of barometric pressure ‘noise’ which remains after subtracting the simultaneous record of two gravimeters is calculated as a function of their separation and indicates that significantly less noise is present in the difference than in the individual records for separations of up to 17° of arc."
flat earth,"SUMMARY 
 
Seismic tomographic results and convection calculations support the evidence of horizontal temperature variations in the mantle. On the basis of commonly accepted rheological laws, we thus expect lateral variations in the viscosity of several orders of magnitude. This paper is concerned with the effects of lateral viscosity variations on vertical displacement induced by Pleistocenic deglaciation. A finite-element scheme in axial symmetry mimics the relaxation process of a flat Earth model characterized by a linear Maxwell rheology. We follow a spectral approach to analyse the impact of lateral viscosity variations with different amplitudes and wavelengths. The potential impact of lithospheric thickening and viscosity increase in stable continental regions on the interpretation of sea level data is also analysed. 
 
 
 
Lateral viscosity heterogeneities are found to have strong influence on ground deformations induced in deglaciated areas. From the analysis of sea level data near the centre of the former Fennoscandian ice sheet and the theoretical predictions of radially and laterally stratified Earth models, we explore the extent to which lateral viscosity contrasts may have influenced the inference of long-term mantle viscosity. 
 
 
 
While radially stratified models predict a rather uniform mantle viscosity, we show that lateral viscosity contrasts of 1 or 2 orders of magnitude are consistent with sea level data if the wavelength of the heterogeneity is comparable with the dimension of a convecting cell. In this case, the average viscosity can deviate by around an order of magnitude from the ‘canonical’ value of 1021 Pa s predicted by rebound models in the past. Viscosity values close to 1021 Pa s are found to be appropriate for the mantle region underlying the load. Long wavelength viscosity variations of 3 or 4 orders of magnitude degrade our ability to reproduce the observed uplift in the centre of the ice sheet and must be ruled out. 
 
 
 
For wavelengths comparable with the horizontal extension of the surface load and viscosity contrasts of 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, model results are found to be inconsistent with sea level data. These findings suggest that rebound modelling can become a useful tool to constrain the magnitude and wavelength of viscosity contrasts. 
 
 
 
Comparison between horizontally and vertically varying models indicates that lateral viscosity heterogeneities could have been interpreted as radial variations in previous rebound studies."
flat earth,"The use of parabolic equation (PE) methods has become very popular in recent years for modeling radar propagation effects in the lower atmosphere, especially for cases in which the vertical refractive index profile changes along the propagation path. The author presents a hybrid propagation model called the radio physical optics (RPO) model that uses a combination of ray optics (RO) and split-step PE methods to overcome the high computational burden of pure split-step PE methods. RPO considers four regions. At ranges less than 2500 meters and for all elevation angles above 5 degrees, RPO uses a flat Earth (FE) model. For the region beyond the FE region, a full RO model is used. The PE model is used for ranges beyond the RO region. For ranges beyond the RO region and heights above the PE region, an extended-optics (XO) method is used."

Plate module membrane filtration equipment was operated to evaluate the performance and selectivity of four different nanofiltration flat sheet membranes. Experiments were first carried out using different model waters. The membranes were discriminating by the rejection of uranium, calcium, and sodium. Then, a uranium concentration test using a nanofiltration membrane showing the highest selectivity for uranium toward alkaline and alkaline-earth ions has been performed on natural seawater. A nanofiltration membrane shows a high selectivity for U(VI), illustrating the advantageous use of nanofiltration for the concentration of uranium from seawater."
flat earth,"Abstract Medieval mappaemundi carry levels of meaning that have been widely misunderstood. Their compilers have been judged on their ability to show geographical reality structured according to a coordinate system, but the primary function of these maps was to provide illustrated histories or moralized, didactic displays in a geographical setting. That medieval thinkers’understanding of the physical world has also been underestimated is reflected in the frequently repeated views that most medieval scholars thought the earth was flat or that Jerusalem should be shown at its center. This paper challenges these commonly held views in the light of recent reinterpretations in art history and the history of cartography. Several themes are explored, including the type of reality represented by the maps, the way the map center changed as the Middle Ages developed, and the relationship between concepts of the earth's sphericity and the graphic constraints on the mappaemundi. Finally, the study suggests ways in whi..."
flat earth,"This paper proposes a technique for using infrared (IR) imagery to eliminate false forward-looking ground penetrating radar (FLGPR) detections by examining areas in IR images corresponding to FLGPR alarm locations. The FLGPR and IR co-location is based on the assumption of a flat earth and the pinhole camera model. The parameters of the camera and its location on the vehicle are not assumed to be known. The parameters of the model are estimated using a set of correspondences gathered from the data utilizing the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) optimization algorithm. Detection of false alarms is accomplished by generating a descriptor, consisting of various statistics calculated from the IR images along with the FLGPR confidence value, for each alarm location. The alarms are then classified based on the Mahalanobis distance between their descriptor and a multivariate normal distribution used to model false alarms. The false alarm distribution is computed from training data where the validity of each alarm location is already known. Using this technique, generally fifteen to twenty percent or more of the FLGPR false alarms can be eliminated without losing any true alarms."
flat earth,"The student-built Agricultural Camera (AgCam) now onboard the International Space Station observes the Earth surface through two linescan cameras with Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) arrays sensitive to visible and near-infrared wavelengths, respectively. The electro-optical components of the AgCam were characterized using precision calibration equipment; a method for modeling and applying these measurements was derived. Correction coefficients to minimize effects of optical vignetting, CCD non-uniform quantum efficiency, and CCD dark current are separately determined using a least squares fit approach. Application of correction coefficients yields significant variability reduction in flat-field images; comparable results are obtained when applied to ground test images."
flat earth,"On Earth, permafrost thawing is linked to climate warming. Similarly, on Mars, permafrost degradation, described from mid-latitude and equatorial settings, is likely linked to global or regional climate change. Putative thermokarst depressions identified on Mars are widely considered to be the result of sublimation, evaporation, or thawing of an ice-rich substrate. The possibility that the depressions formed by melting of permafrost to create alas-like lakes has been recently proposed, but is controversial, owing to the lack of primary evidence for liquid filling the depressions. Here we use high-resolution Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera images and derived topographic data to characterize possible thermokarst terrain in Ares Vallis. The terrain comprises subcircular to irregular, flat-floored rimless topographic depressions that occur at varying elevations. We report the discovery of narrow channels connecting thermokarst-like depressions that provide evidence for the previous presence of ponded liquid water. Crater counts on these surfaces indicate resurfacing that is likely related to flood deposition of water-saturated sediments in Ares Vallis during the Hesperian (ca. 3.6–3.0 Ga). We infer that thermokarst lakes formed after flooding by thawing of ice within the sediments during transient warm periods in the Hesperian, a time previously considered to be too cold to permit ice thaw."
flat earth,"Pool boiling experiments using R-113 were conducted in the microgravity of space on a flat heater, consisting of a semitransparent gold film sputtered on quartz substrate, 19.05 x 38.1 mm (0.75 x 1.50 in.). Transient measurements of both the mean heater surface temperature and input heat flux are used to compute the mean heat transfer coefficient at the heater wall. Steady-state pool boiling is achieved in microgravity under conditions in which a large vapor bubble somewhat removed from the heater surface is formed, which acts as a reservoir for the nucleating bubbles. The steady nucleate boiling heat transfer is enhanced materially in microgravity relative to that in Earth gravity, whereas the heat flux at which dryout occurs is considerably less. Using quasisteady data obtained during periods in which some significant portions of the heater surface were dried out, it was possible to construct two distinct composite approximate microgravity pool boiling curves for R-113, one for the higher level of subcooling and one for the lower level of subcooling. These are compared with a reference curve for pool boiling at a/g = +1, constructed from available data and correlations deemed to reasonably represent the circumstances present."
flat earth,"Extremely long basaltic lava flows are here presented and described. The flows originated from the great, polygenetic, fissural Payen Volcanic Complex, in the Andean back-arc volcanic province of Payenia in Argentina. The lava flows outpoured during the Late Quaternary from the summit rift of a shield volcano representing the first volcanic centre of this complex. One of these flows presents an individual tongue-like shape with a length of 181 km and therefore is the longest known individual Quaternary lava flow on Earth. Leaving the flanks of the volcano this flow reached the Salado river valley at La Pampa and, in its distal portion, maintained its narrow and straight shape without any topographic control over a flat alluvial plain. It has a hawaiite composition with low phenocryst content of prevailing olivine and minor plagioclase. Rare Earth element patterns are typical of Na-alkaline basalts, but incompatible trace element patterns and Sr -Nd isotope ratios, suggest a geodynamic setting transitional to the orogenic one. The flow advanced following the thermally efficient ""inflation"" mechanism, as demonstrated by a peculiar association of well developed morphological, structural and textural features. The temperature of 1130-1160°C and the viscosity of 3-73 Pa*s, calculated by petrochemical data, may be considered, together with a very low cooling rate and a sustained and long lasting effusion rate, the main causes of the extremely long transport system of this flow. Both the extreme length of the flow and the partial lack of topographic control may provide new constraints on the physics of large inflated flows, which constitute the largest volcanic provinces on Earth and probably also on the terrestrial planets."
flat earth,"We present initial flight data from the first Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) satellite. Launched on 20 November 2011, RAX-1 was a joint venture between the University of Michigan and SRI International. Its primary mission objective was to study small-scale plasma density irregularities in the Earth’s ionosphere. Several electrostatic ion plasma instabilities are known to spawn magnetic field-aligned irregularities (FAI), or dense plasma clouds that can disrupt communication between Earth and orbiting spacecraft. The RAX mission utilized a bistatic radar configuration; the RAX spacecraft is the radar receiver and the transmitters are several world-wide incoherent scatter radars. The primary radar is located in Poker Flat, Alaska. We describe initial flight results from the mission. The radar receiver was successfully operated and performed better than estimated on orbit. RAX-1 bus performance was also successful except for the solar power generation system. A systematic fault in the panels resulted in loss of power about sixty days into the mission. Despite this failure, RAX-1 demonstrated that novel science is possible and useful on small nanosatellite platforms. We describe lessons learned from the mission. We also give a brief overview of our continued development effort on the RAX mission in preparation for a late 2011 launch of a second spacecraft, RAX-2."
flat earth,"Solar wind electron velocity distributions measured across interplanetary shocks using the Los Alamos plasma analyzer on ISEE 3 have been studied to understand electron heating mechanisms for weak and intermediate strength collisionless shocks. This study thus complements earlier studies of electron heating at the earth's bow shock, an example of a highly supercritical collisionless shock. At the weakest interplanetary shocks (downstream to upstream density ratio N(d/u) ≲ 2 and velocity difference V(d-u) ≲ 70 km/s), heating perpendicular to the magnetic field B predominates over parallel heating. Such heating may be a consequence of conservation of magnetic moment across the shock. At the stronger interplanetary shocks (N(d/u) ≳ 2 and V(d-u) ≳ 70 km/s), heating parallel to B is dominant and the downstream velocity distributions are flat-topped, similar to what is observed downstream of the earth's bow shock. This similarity suggests that electron heating in all collisionless shocks with N(d/u) ≳ 2 and V(d-u) ≳ 70 km/s results in part from an acceleration parallel to B produced by the macroscopic shock electric field, followed by beam driven plasma instabilities."
flat earth,"We present results of a study of a deployable version of the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST), designed to operate in a Sun-Earth L2 orbit. The primary mirror of the segmented 9.2-meter aperture has 36 hexagonal 1.315 m (flat-to-flat) glass mirrors. The architecture and folding of the telescope is similar to JWST, allowing it to fit into the 6.5 m fairing of a modest upgrade to the Delta-IV Heavy version of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). We discuss the overall observatory design, optical design, instruments, stray light, wavefront sensing and control, pointing and thermal control, and in-space servicing options."
flat earth,"Switched reluctance (SR) motors attract attention as a machine without rare-earth materials. And it is a candidate technology for electric vehicle application. However, torque density of SR motors is smaller than that of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs). Recently, an axial-gap structure is attention on possibility of effective utilization of in-wheel flat motor space. In the paper, a new flat volume axial-gap SR motor as high torque density for in-wheel direct-drive EV is designed. The characteristics of the proto-type machines are measured and compared with FEA results. The characteristics agree with simulation results. Finally, the proto-type machines are mounted on an 8-passenger 2,000 kg vehicle like small bus. The test drive of the in-wheel direct-drive axial gap SR motor vehicle is succeeded."
flat earth,"KS waveforms recorded at distances of about 110 o are extremely useful to constrain seismic velocity structure at the base of the mantle. $KS waves near this distance develop a com- plicated interference pattern with the phases SPaKS and $KP,& We report anomalous behavior of this interference in a number of recordings of deep earthquakes beneath South America from sta- tions in Europe and Africa. We model these data with two-dimensional dome-like structures at the base of the mantle which extend laterally by a few hundred kilometers and in which the shear velocity is up to 30% lower than in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). The spatial extent of these structures, their position with respect to the SKS core exit points, and their seismic characteristics can not be uniquely determined. However, the presence of a dipping or a concaved upper interface is a key attribute of successful models. Models that invoke flat layers are insuffi- ciently complex to explain the most erratic waveform behavior. The most anomalous data corre- spond to sampling regions at the base of the mantle beneath the East African Rift and beneath the Iceland, where possibly, whole mantle upwellings form."
flat earth,"The land skin temperature, an important feature for agricultural monitoring, convective processes, and the earth’s radiation budget, is monitored from limited-view satellite imagers. The angular dependence of this parameter is examined using simultaneous views of clear areas from up to three geostationary satellites. Daytime temperatures from different satellites differed by up t o 6 K and varied as a function of the time of day. Larger differences are expected to occur but were not measured because of limited viewing angles. These differences suggest that biases may occur in both the magnitude and phase of the diurnal cycle of skin temperature and its mean value whenever geostationary satellite data are used to determine skin temperature. The temperature differences were found over both flat and mountainous regions with some slight dependence on vegetation. The timing and magnitude of the temperature differences provide some initial validation for relatively complex model calculations of skin temperature variability. The temperature differences are strongly correlated with terrain and the anisotropy of reflected solar radiation for typical land surfaces. These strong dependencies suggest the possibility for the development of a simple empirical approach for characterizing the temperature anisotropy. Additional research using a much greater range of viewing angles is required to confirm the potential of the suggested empirical approach."
flat earth,"SUMMARY 
The five independent components Γxz, Γyz, Γzz, Γxx - Γyy, and Γxy, of the gravity tensor are measurable by gradiometers. When grouped into {Γzz}, {Γxz, Γyz} and {Γxx - Γyy, 2Γxy} and expanded into an infinite series of pure-spin spherical harmonic tensors, simple eigenvalue connections can be derived between these three sets and the spherical harmonic expansion of the gravity potential. The three eigenvalues are (n+ 1)(n+ 2), -(n+ 2)√n(n+ 1) and √(n - 1)n(n+ 1)(n+ 2). This result permits an easy analytical incorporation of all measurable tensor components into a spectral signal and noise analysis of gravity quantities on a sphere. Analogous relations also exist for a 2-D Fourier (flat earth) expansion of these three sets. An additional advantageous feature of the set {Γxx - Γyy, 2Γxy}, besides the simple eigenvalue relation, is its invariance with respect to small position uncertainties, e.g., of the trajectory of the satellite or airplane carrying the gradiometer. Hence a complete framework exists in terms of the eigenvectors of all operators connecting the zeroth, first, and second derivatives of the gravitational potential. At the same time the results facilitate the planning of gradiometer missions and their data analysis."
flat earth,"Abstract We analyzed data on numbers and annual trends of breeding terns and gulls based on censuses of all colonies of the Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia), Forster’s Tern (S. forsteri) and California Gull (Larus californicus) in the San Francisco Bay estuary from 1982 to 2003. All species used nesting substrates that were flat, largely non-vegetated, had a wide view in all directions, and were composed of sand, gravel, or earth. The estuary supported 17, 13, and seven colonies of each species, respectively. Nesting terns were primarily on salt evaporation pond islands and tidal islands. The largest colony of California Gulls was on a deactivated salt pond. Total numbers of each species in 2003 were about 2,300, 2,450 and 21,200 breeding birds, respectively. Numbers of Forster’s Terns declined significantly during the study, while California Gulls increased, and the number of Caspian Terns was stable. Numbers of each species at each colony site have shown considerable annual variation. We attribute the lack of colony site fidelity of each species, and the decline among Forster’s Terns, primarily to mammalian predation, human disturbance, and possibly annual variation in food availability. Flat, minimally vegetated islands, which are few in the estuary, are critical for maintaining nesting terns and California Gulls. Yet, the planned restoration of 65% (9,050 ha) of the salt pond complex of the San Francisco Bay estuary will likely remove some of the salt pond islands and levees where 20% of the Caspian Terns (438 birds), 80% of Forster’s Terns (1,958) and 96% of California Gulls (20,210) were nesting in 2003. We recommend that restoration plans should include the creation of sizeable tracts of islands specifically designed to provide nesting habitat for these larids. These replacement sites should be in place soon after the restoration has been implemented; i.e., well before scheduled completion. This is especially important because severe habitat limitation would lead to competition for nesting space among the three species, a situation expected to result in exclusion of the terns by the gull, which nests earlier, are larger, more abundant, and more aggressive."
flat earth,"Postseismic horizontal strain and displacement following the June 28, 1992, Landers, California, earthquake (MW 7.3) is broad scale and cannot be explained solely by delayed afterslip located at the rupturing fault trace. Both the observed strain at Pinon Flat Observatory (PFO) and observed Global Positioning System receiver velocities evolve rapidly after the Landers-Big Bear earthquake sequence. The observed exponential decay of these motions, with timescales of 4–34 days, may reflect a soft creep rheology in the lower crust and brittle-ductile transition zone or even within the seismogenic crust itself. Here a simple model of a two-dimensional screw dislocation in a layered Maxwell viscoelastic Earth is employed in conjunction with a composite rheology to demonstrate that the short timescale transient response modes (≈4–34 days) are consistent with the behavior of a biviscous lower crust. The lowest viscosity of this system is derivable from laboratory experimental data on the long-term creep of natural quarztites, and the highest viscosity is consistent with isostasy-related lower crustal flow in a continental extensional tectonic environment. The model predicts significant stress relaxation at the base of the seismogenic crust. Near the base of the seismogenic zone, and about 4 km away from the mainshock, the rate of predicted relaxation is of the order of 0.01 MPa d−1 during the first 20 days of postseismic flow. Oblate spheroidal inclusions at 5% concentration levels that are both aligned and fairly flat in shape and that have a viscosity of 3–4 × 1015 Pa s are consistent with both the amplitude and decay time of horizontal crustal strain observed at PFO after the Landers mainshock. It is speculated that the structures exposed in cross sections and in seismic reflection profiles of the lower crust that have mylonitic associations are, in part, the cause of such rapid postseismic evolution in southeastern California. Unmylonitized quartz-rich rock at sufficiently elevated temperatures could also contribute to the rapid decay modes."
flat earth,"The accuracy of limit equilibrium slope stability analyses procedures is examined by comparing the results of the Simplified Bishop procedure with results obtained using the finite element procedure of analysis. The distributions of normal stresses along the shear surface were compared and found to be reasonably similar, the agreement between the two procedures being closest for relatively flat slopes with relatively low values of cohesion. The values of the factor of safety, while assumed constant in the Bishop procedure, were shown by the finite element analyses to vary considerably along the shear surface. However, the overall, or average, values of the factor of safety computed by these two procedures were found to agree within 5 percent over the range of conditions investigated. It was concluded from these results that the Simplified Bishop procedure, as well as many other limit equilibrium analysis procedures, do not involve large errors in the computed values for the overall factor of safety of earth slopes."
flat earth,"The high resolution camera (HRC) is a microchannel plate based imaging detector for the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) that will be placed in a high earth orbit scheduled for launch in August, 1998. An end-to-end calibration of the HRC and the AXAF high resolution mirror assembly (HRMA) was carried out at the Marshall Space Flight Center's X-Ray Calibration Facility (XRCF). This activity was followed by several modifications to the HRC to improve its performance, and a series of flat field calibrations. In this paper, and the following companion papers, we discuss the calibration plans, sequences, and results of these tests. At the time of this conference, the HRC has been fully flight qualified and is being integrated into the science instrument module (SIM) in preparation for integration into the AXAF spacecraft."
flat earth,"In this letter, a two-channel airborne experimental interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) designed for terrain height estimation is exploited to acquire the ability of ground moving target indication (GMTI). Due to the hybrid baseline of this system, the interferometric phase changes with the target motion as well as the terrain height. The fluctuation of the interferometric phase worsens the performance of the clutter suppression and the radial velocity estimation. In order to resolve this problem, a GMTI method with three steps is proposed. After two steps are used to eliminate the local flat-Earth phase and the cross-track interferometric phase of the scene, respectively, an adaptive filtering method is used to suppress the stationary clutter with the benefit of calibrating the sensor responses. A conventional constant false alarm rate detector is then used to indicate the moving targets. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated with real data collected using an experimental airborne InSAR system."
flat earth,"Full-waveform airborne laser scanners (ALS) transmit short laser pulses towards the Earth’s surface and record the complete backscattered echo. The backscattered echo from flat terrain is simply a replica of the original laser pulse, but over vegetated and built-up areas the backscattered echo is often rather complex. The waveform is commonly modelled as a superposition of a number of distinct echoes, which involves the detection and localization of these echoes and a non-linear optimization of the model. This paper discusses the averaged square difference function (ASDF) method for detecting and localizing echoes in full-waveform ALS data. The ASDF is analytically equivalent to the direct correlation method. The results of echo detection and range estimation by ASDF were compared empirically with those derived by classical pulse detection in combination with Gaussian Decomposition. Furthermore, the ASDF approach was also tested for its adequacy to suppress false echoes caused by the so-called ringing effect which may occur in ALS data in case of strong echoes. It is found that the results of the ASDF approach coincide to a high percentage with those of Gaussian Decomposition. Moreover, this approach suppresses the detection of false echoes due to the ringing effect."
flat earth,"Human space flight in the US and other space-faring countries is faced with a twin challenge that is likely to persist for many years: flat or declining budgets along with an expectation of continuing, significant achievements. A partial solution may involve increased participation by multiple commercial competitors with the promise - albeit yet to be fully demonstrated - of much-reduced costs. That said, most commercial goals are concentrated on low-Earth orbit (LEO) for the time being, leaving human trips beyond Earth orbit (BED) as governmental initiatives. The past decade, beginning with the 1999/2000 Decadal Planning Team (DPT)/NASA Exploration Team (NExT) human space flight studies for the White House Office of Management and Budget (http://history.nasa.gov/DPT/DPT.htm), can arguably be described as a Golden Age of engineering design, strategic planning, technology capability prioritization, and development programs on the International Space Station (ISS). However, cynics have criticized the same period as little more than PowerPoint presentations, and unfocused technology investments with only limited progress toward a goal of human space flight beyond the immediate vicinity of the Earth. We disagree with the cynics. Experience with the ISS on increasingly sophisticated capabilities have prepared international partners to deploy a major ""stepping stone"" for human space flight: a habitation system in free space beyond low-Earth orbit. Such an achievement would be a major milestone in human space flight and, very likely, an essential demonstration site for subsequent, very ambitious exploration missions such as to Mars. Developing critical capabilities for human voyages beyond LEO, such as Earth-Moon libration points, offers, as just one example, easy return to Earth within days (see, e.g., Farquhar 1971 (Aeronautics & Astronautics, July, p. 59ff), Thronson, Lester, and Talay 2011 (http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1756/1), and Lester 2012 (http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1650/1). Use of Earth-Moon libration points as sites for early demonstrations of capabilities necessary for human missions to Mars, for example, contrasts sharply with using missions to near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for that purpose."
flat earth,"The research presented in this article is about the way science teachers from Elementary School think about astronomical elements. Its methodology is based on semi-structured interviews, which were video recorded. The research is centered in a three-dimensional perspective of astronomical Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the planets and the stars, and also the conceptions about sky and Universe. The esults indicate a Universe that contains: Sun, stars, planets and Moon; where the Solar System is a little part of the whole. Sometimes they think that the Solar System is the Universe. The objects are in the sky or in the Universe, which, for many of them, is only the space above the Earth. The flat shape of astronomical objects and the spatial structure of the Universe are striking features. Many of them think that Sun and stars are different: the Sun is a hot object and the stars are cold ones. These results worry us and they certainly indicate how urgent it is to plan Professional Development in Astronomy for teachers, after all the PCN´s emphasize that this subject is important to be taught."
flat earth,"Abstract A mathematical modeling of large, cathodically protected, buried pipe networks was undertaken. The resulting model, OKAPPI, an abbreviation for the Dutch “Ondergrondse Kathodische Protectie Pijpleidingen,” coupled the boundary element method (BEM) and the finite element method (FEM) for the cathodic protection of buried pipes. The approach was based on the assumption that the soil was homogeneous, and the local earth surface was presumed flat. The current density pattern around the pipes was modeled as uniform. The model was three dimensional and minimized discretization. The major innovation in the simulation was the inclusion of nonnegligible ohmic voltage drops in the pipelines. OKAPPI results were shown to simplify macroscopic design since knowledge of potential levels along pipes, potential distribution in the soil, axial currents flowing through pipelines, and radial current densities leaving or entering the pipe walls is important for the monitoring and control of cathodic protection syste..."
flat earth,"Igneous blocks in Franciscan melanges are of three chemical-petrologic types: (1) tholeiitic basalts of both arc and spreading center origin, with depletions in light relative to heavy rare-earth elements, $$3\%> TiO_{2} >1\%$$, high Y/Zr and Y/Ti ratios, and relict augites that generally have low Al and Ti and well-defined iron-enrichment trends; (2) basalts of probable seamount origin with marked enrichments in light relative to heavy rare-earth elements, $$5\%> TiO_{2} >1\%$$, lower Y/Zr and Y/Ti than (1), and Ti-Al-rich augites showing little if any iron-enrichment trends; and (3) hypabyssal intrusives having $$SiO_{2} >52\%, TiO_{2} <1\%$$, flat or only slightly fractionated rare-earth-abundance patterns, and diopsidic augites that are very low in Ti and Al and show no iron-enrichment trends. All of the blocks are metamorphosed; most are undeformed pumpellyite-bearing greenstones, and a few contain sodic amphibole ± lawsonite ± sodic pyroxene. The melanges are probably olistostromal in origin, deriving their igneous block detritus both from the downgoing Pacific plate (ocean floor basalts and seamounts) and from the hanging wall of the Franciscan trench (basalts and arc-related silicic intrusive rocks). The silicic intrusive rocks and some of the basalts are eroded fragments of the fore-arc crust that ultimately became the Coast Range Ophiolite. These fragments were incorporated into the Franciscan trench fill and subducted. Our results suggest that the igneous blocks in ophiolitic melanges provide important information about melange formation and about the tectonics and paleogeography of the regions in which the melanges are found."
flat earth,A method for numerically solving the equation of radiative transfer in a spherical shell atmosphere is presented. The method uses a conical boundary and a Gauss-Seidel iteration scheme to solve for all orders of scattering along a single radial line in the atmosphere. Tests of the model indicate an accuracy better than 1% for most Earth-atmosphere situations. Results from this model are compared with flat-atmosphere model results for a scattering-only atmosphere. These comparisons indicate that excluding spherical effects for solar zenith angles greater than 85° leads to errors larger than 5% at optical depths as small as 0.10.

flat earth,"This paper reports LA-ICP MS zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions from the granites in south of Yin'aoxia,southern Beishan Mountain,Gansu Province.The results show that the pluton was emplaced with the age of 281.7±2.9Ma.Its eHf(t) values are +4.4~+7.8 with the average of +5.9 and Hf modal ages are 613~771Ma.The granitic body mainly consists of biotite granites which belong to middle-K cal-alkaline series with metaluminous-peraluminous characteristics and high contents of SiO2 (72.84%~74.59%),Na2O+K2O (6.54%~9.06%) and Na2O (Na2O/K2O1).In addition,they invariably exhibit relatively gentle light rare earth elements (LREE) enrichment with flat heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and weak negative Eu anomalies (δEu=0.58~0.81) in the chondrite-normalized REE patterns,depletion of Nb,Ba,P,Ti and enrichment of Rb,Pb,K in the spidergram.Based on the regional geology,the above characteristics reflect that the Yin'aoxia granites were the mixing products of crustal and mantle derived magmas and formed under the tectonic setting of post-collisional extension in Early Permian.This implies that the area of Yin'aoxia may enter into the stage of collision after the closure of the ocean basin in Late Carboniferous and we could safely say that it turned to the stage of rift in post-collisional extensional period during Early Permian."
flat earth,"Coseismic deformations of the January 17, 1994, Northridge, California earthquake are mapped using interferometric combination of synthetic aperture radar images acquired by the Japanese Earth Resource Satellite (JERS 1) on April 30, 1993, and June 14, 1994. We make an interferogram in a rectangular area with a size of 18.6 km (N-S) by 29.9 km (E-W). Although coherence is not perfect in some areas, fringes in flat and inhabited areas clearly show the coseismic movements. To remove ambiguity of the fringes due to inaccurate orbital information, we use a least squares adjustment to minimize the difference between the radar and the Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. The difference between the radar and GPS measurements is less than 3.5 cm. The observed fringe patterns agree with a GPS-based theoretical fault model within 10 cm. We also find a lobed pattern that suggests up to 20 cm of subsidence within a small area. The results suggest that the L band (23.5 cm) radar used by JERS 1 is more robust to spatial and temporal decorrelation than the C band radar used by the ERS 1 and RADARSAT satellites."
flat earth,"We investigate the estimation of Earth strain from borehole strain meter data in a study of tidal calibration of the Gladwin borehole tensor strain meter (BTSM) at Pinon Flat. Small-scale geological inhomogeneity is one of several effects examined that cross couple remote areal/shear strain into measured areal/shear strain. A methodology is developed for incorporating cross coupling into the strain meter calibration. Using the measured strain tides from the colocated laser strain meter (LSM) as a reference, we show that calibration of the BTSM with cross coupling removes systematic errors of up to 30% in the borehole strain meter tides. This calibration accurately relates the BTSM measurements to strains at the scale length of the LSM, about 1 km. The calibration technique provides a solution to a major criticism of all short-baseline strain measurements, namely, that tectonic strains are not representatively sampled due to small-scale inhomogeneities. The technique removes errors potentially greater than 50% in observed strain offsets from fault slip, permitting improved constraint of slip mechanisms. We show that current theoretical estimates of strain tides in the instrument locality are not yet of sufficient accuracy for cross-coupled calibration. Comparison of theoretical tides with measurements from the LSM suggest that at least half of the error is in the ocean load tide estimates."
flat earth,"We propose that a molecular midwife, a flat molecule approximately 10 Ax10 A with two hydrophobic faces, was essential to the origin of life. This molecule was positively charged, water soluble and did not strongly associate with itself in solution. It may have been a derivative of phthalocyanine that no longer exists on the Earth today, and might have been formed solely from hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde. The midwife tended to intercalate between side groups (bases, similar to those in RNA) of polymers to form stacks, which incorporated bare bases. The midwife alternated in these stacks with hydrogen-bonded tetrads of bases. Under conditions of low water activity, as in a desert during the day, bare bases in the stacks were joined together by neutral and chemically heterogeneous backbones of no fixed chirality. The components of the backbones were the products of the formose reaction of formaldehyde, and were involved in the reversible formation of N -glycosides and acetals catalysed by divalent metal ions. The final product of this assemblage was a fully intercalated quadruplex of four information-containing polymer strands (four proto -RNA molecules). This process constituted replication of the original polymer that had seeded the formation of the stack. The stack structure ensured that the polymer's base sequence was replicated faithfully despite the lack of both homochirality and chemical homogeneity in the backbone. At night, water from condensing dew would suddenly come in contact with these products, quenching all chemical reactions and releasing midwife molecules and single- or double-stranded proto-RNA. Evaporation of water during the day then gave new stacks containing one or two proto-RNA strands, bare bases, and midwife molecules, which could begin a new replication cycle. Our model also allows for the generation of new stacks and the extension of existing ones, without restricting the base sequence of either, thereby providing a source of genetic information. The proto-RNA replication cycle is driven purely by concentration changes caused by the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. We propose that this system as a whole could have gradually evolved into the RNA World."
flat earth,"SUMMARY 
 
Combining CHAMP satellite magnetic measurements with aeromagnetic and marine magnetic data, the global geomagnetic field has now been modelled to spherical harmonic degree 720. An important tool in field modelling is the geomagnetic power spectrum. It allows the comparison of field models estimated from different data sets and can be used to identify noise levels and systematic errors. A correctly defined geomagnetic power spectrum is flat (white) for an uncorrelated field, such as the Earth's crustal magnetic field at long wavelengths. It can be inferred from global spherical harmonic models as well as from regional grids. Marine and aeromagnetic grids usually represent the anomaly of the total intensity of the magnetic field. Appropriate corrections have to be applied in estimating the geomagnetic power spectrum from such data. The comparison of global and regional spectra using a consistently defined azimuthally averaged geomagnetic power spectrum facilitates quality control in field modelling and should provide new insights in magnetic anomaly interpretation."
flat earth,"[1] The presence of a dust layer in the Earth's mesosphere is generally accepted on theoretical grounds (Hunten et al., 1980), but its experimental verification has been difficult and its influence on mesospheric dynamics and chemistry is not yet understood. Four sounding rockets carrying detectors designed to measure nanometer-sized charged dust particles were flown from Poker Flat in March 2002. Ground-based lidars were used to measure neutral sodium and iron densities during the launches in an effort to determine whether dust has an influence on mesospheric chemistry, specifically, as related to atomic Na and Fe. In situ measurements of charged dust and plasma densities were compared with the ground-based lidar data. Strong correlations between the charged dust profile and the neutral Fe profile were observed on all four flights. This finding suggests that dust serves as a reservoir for atomic iron in the mesosphere."
flat earth,"A lunar semidiurnal variation (12·4206 h period) induced by tides in the deep ocean is demonstrated in (i) a month's observations of the horizontal electric field and magnetic declination at a sea floor site located 600 km off the California coast in 4·4 km of water, in (ii) a month's observations of the vertical magnetic field at a coastal site near Cambria, California, and in (iii) two years' observations of the vertical magnetic field at the island magnetic observatory on San Miguel, Azores. Comparison of the sea floor, coastal, and island observations with simultaneous continental magnetic observations permits an estimation of that part of the variation due to a lunar ionospheric oscillation. 
 
 
 
The observed oceanic induced variation at the sea floor and coastal sites are found to agree well with tidal induced fields computed for a model of the Earth's electrical conductivity and lunar semidiurnal tide. The model assumes (i) a flat semi-infinite ocean of uniform depth and conductivity, rotating at a uniform rate appropriate to the latitude of interest, (ii) non-conducting atmosphere, continent and upper mantle, and (iii) superconducting mantle at a uniform depth beneath the ocean. 
 
 
 
The observed oceanic induced vertical magnetic field at San Miguel is found to agree qualitatively with tidal induced fields computed for an island model. This model assumes (i) a uniformly conducting small circular island, (ii) a flat infinite ocean of uniform depth and conductivity, rotating at a uniform rate appropriate to the latitude of interest, (iii) a non-conducting atmosphere and upper mantle, and (iv) a superconducting mantle at a depth much greater than the size of the island."

flat earth,"The Early Neoproterozoic Beiyixi Formation volcanic rocks of the southern Quruqtagh comprise mainly of a suite of tholeiitic basalts, alkaline andesites, and calc‐alkaline rhyolites. The rhyolites are characterized by variably fractionated enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) and flat in heavy rare earth elements (HREE), and strongly negative Eu anomalies. Compared to the rhyolites, the andesites also exhibit enrichment in LREE and flat HREE (chondrite‐normalized values of La/Yb, and La/Sm are 13.30–41.09, 3.18–6.89 respectively). Their rare earth element patterns display minor negative Eu anomalies. Both of them exhibit coherent patterns with strongly to moderately negative anomalies of Nb, Zr, Ti, and Hf on spider diagrams. Two rhyolite and one andesite magmatic zircons with defined oscillatory zoning yielded weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of 743 ± 7 Ma, 741±2 Ma, and 727±4 Ma. These ages are interpreted to represent the riming of volcanic eruptions. According to geochemistry and rock type, these volcanic rocks formed within a continental island‐arc environment following subduction of the oceanic crust during the Early Neoproterozoic period."
flat earth,"The tectonic character oceanic crustal generation in the Mariana Trough, an active, extensional, back-arc basin, is similar in many ways to that at normal mid-ocean ridges. Thus it might be expected that the basalts erupted in the basin would be like normal mid-ocean ridge basalt. Basaltic glasses from each environment show consistent differences, however, Mariana Trough basaltic glasses have lower total iron and TiO2 and higher A12O3 at a given MgO concentration. The rare earth patterns for Mariana Trough glasses are essentially flat relative to chondrite. Incompatible element abundances are higher for the trough basalts than for ridge basalts. The volatile content of trough basalts is high (approximately 1% H2O). These compositional characteristics are also true of basalts from other active marginal basins and suggest that the sources of these lavas differ from those of normal mid-ocean ridge basalts. Part of the reason for these differences may be the peculiar tectonic environment of active back-arc basins, in particular their location above the subducted oceanic lithospheric plate."
flat earth,"The structure, tectonics, and evolution of large volcanoes on Venus, as revealed by data from the Magellan mission, appear to be distinct from those on Earth and Mars. To determine the conditions and processes that account for these differences, we model the evolution of stress and deformation in growing volcanic edifices on Venus using the finite element method. Large volcanoes on Venus are characterized by topographically prominent conical edifices surrounded by relatively flat flow aprons. The surfaces of both edifice and apron consist dominantly of radially oriented flows. Tectonic features, usually the surface expression of shallowly intruded dikes, also have predominantly radial orientations. Features similar to Hawaiian-style linear rift zones or large-scale flank failure, common on large volcanoes on Earth and Mars, are absent. By comparing predictions of faulting for models with detached and welded basal boundary conditions with the observed tectonic features, we determine that a welded condition is more likely. Horizontal compressive stresses transmitted into edifices across welded basal boundaries are inversely proportional to elastic lithosphere thickness Te. Contravening stress increments from magma chamber expansion, differential thermal contraction, or buoyant loading from beneath the crust or lithosphere are required to reorient principal stresses in the edifice so that magma ascent and radial dike formation are favored. Incremental volcano growth results in stress distributions that decrease with height in the edifice. Dike intrusion is easiest in the uppermost (youngest) layers, consistent with the observed shallow radial dikes on Venus volcanoes. Small values of Te greatly inhibit the formation of large shields, in that conical edifice topography cannot be supported and large contravening stresses are required for further growth. Large volcano formation is much more likely at large Te, where more moderate contravening stresses are sufficient for growth. The near-surface manifestation of mantle upwelling on Venus may thus depend on Te in that the response to upwellings beneath thin or nonexistent lithosphere is likely to be dominantly ductile, leading to the formation of coronae, but a thick elastic lithosphere is required to support the growth of the largest volcanoes. The transitional value of Te between these modes of evolution likely depends on the horizontal scale of the upwelling."
flat earth,"Global overturn of a hot, gravitationally unstable lunar mantle immediately following the solidification of a magma ocean [and essentially complete by 4.4 Ga] explains several characteristics of lunar petrology. Lunar mare basalt sources are inferred to be depleted in europium and alumina. These depletions are consensually attributed to complementary plagioclase floating from a magma ocean. However, the connection cannot be so simple and direct: in contrast to the mare basalt source parent magma, the ferroan anorthosite parent magma was more evolved by virtue of its lower Mg/Fe ratio and Ni abundances, although less evolved in its poverty of clinopyroxene constituents, flat rare earth pattern, and lower incompatible element abundances. The europium anomaly in mare sources is inferred to be present at 400 km depth, too deep to have been directly influenced by plagioclase crystallization. Massive overturning of the post-magma ocean mantle would have carried down clinopyroxene, ilmenite, and phases containing fractionated rare earths, europium anomalies, and some heat-producing radionuclides. These phases contributed to deep mare basalt sources. Upward-moving phases would have been magnesian mafic minerals; their immediate melting on pressure release contributed the magnesian suite of plutonic norites and troctolites that post-date the anorthosites in the highlands crust."
flat earth,"In southern Albania the Mirdita Ophiolitic nappe is characterized by subophiolitic complexes in which remnants of volcanic ophiolite sequences of Triassic age have been identified, either as rare blocks of variable dimension in the Rubik Complex, or as a thin tectonic unit (the Porava Unit), sited immediately under the main ophiolitic masses of the Eastern Ophiolite Belt. In this paper the results of petrological investigations on basalts and biostratigraphical studies on associated radiolarian cherts included in these subophiolitic complexes units are presented.
Biostratigraphical investigations indicate that cherts have ages ranging from Middle to Late Triassic. The associated basalts are represented by both high- Ti mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and alkaline ocean island basalts (OIB). MORB rocks mainly consist of basalts and ferrobasalts with a mild enrichment in low field strength elements and flat rare earth element patterns and, subordinately, by basalts strongly depleted in incompatible elements and light rare earth elements. The chemistry of slightly enriched MORB is consistent with a generation in a mid-ocean ridge setting, from somewhat enriched sub-oceanic mantle source(s), whereas depleted MORB generated from a primitive MOR-type mantle source. The OIB rocks imply a generation in a within-plate oceanic setting from a mantle source enriched by plume chemical components.
Basalts and associated cherts from southern Albania subophiolitic melanges represent remnants of a Triassic oceanic lithosphere, which testify for the existence, from northern Albania to southern Greece, of a Middle to Late Triassic oceanic basin located between the Adria and Eurasia plates.
The occurrence in the Rubik Complex and Porava Unit of MOR basalts generated from differently enriched sources, as well as of alkaline OIBs, suggests that the early stage of oceanic spreading was variably associated with a plume activity."
flat earth,"Summary 
 
We describe a new technique for incorporating seafloor topography in electromagnetic modelling. It is based on a transformation of the topographic relief into a change in electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability within a flat seafloor. Since the technique allows us to model arbitrary topographic changes without extra grid cells and any restriction by vertical discretization, we can model very precise topographic changes easily without an extra burden in terms of computer memory or calculation time. The reliability and stability of the technique are tested by comparing the magnetotelluric responses from two synthetic seafloor topography models with three different approaches; these incorporate the topographic change in terms of (1) the change in conductance, using the thin-sheet approximation; (2) a series of rectangular block-like steps; and (3) triangular finite elements. The technique is easily applied to any modelling method including 3D modelling, allowing us to model complex structure in the Earth while taking full account of the 3D seafloor topography."
flat earth,"SUMMARY The spectrum of a high degree spherical harmonic model of the geomagnetic field is analysed to compute the constants for the core and crustal field contributions. Using a noise estimate of 0.091 nT2 at the mean Magsat radius of 6791 km, the power reduced to the Earth's surface is found to be 9.66 X 10' (0.286)"" nT2 for the core, and 19.1 (0.996)"" nT2 for the crust. These values show half the crustal power extrapolated to n = 0 compared with a previously published n = 23 model, and a white noise depth of only 14 km below the mean surface. The core spectrum power is 30 per cent less than previously estimated and becomes flat 80 km below the core-mantle boundary. The crustal power level is an eighth of that of an estimate based on one-dimensional analyses of Project MAGNET survey lines. The point where the energy density of the core and crustal components become equal at the Earth's surface is n = 14.2."
flat earth,"It has been suggested that hypernova remnants, with a substantial amount of energy in semi-relativistic ejecta, can accelerate intermediate mass or heavy nuclei to ultrahigh energies and provide a sufficient amount of energy in cosmic rays to account for the observed flux. We here calculate the expected energy spectrum and chemical composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays from such semi-relativistic hypernovae. With a chemical composition equal to that of the hypernova ejecta and a flat or hard spectrum for cosmic rays at the sources, the spectrum and composition of the propagated cosmic rays observed at the Earth can be compatible with the measurements by the Pierre Auger Observatory."
flat earth,"To remain economically and environmentally sustainable, Australian rice growers need to be able to readily respond to market opportunities and increase cropping system productivity and water productivity. Water availability is decreasing whereas its price is increasing. Alternative irrigation layouts and water management approaches could contribute to reduced water use and increased irrigation efficiency. This paper reports results for the first crop (rice) in a cropping system experiment to compare permanent raised bed and conventional layouts on a transitional red-brown earth at Coleambally, New South Wales. The performance of conventional ponded rice grown on a flat layout was compared with rice grown on 1.84-m wide, raised beds with furrow and subsurface drip irrigation. In addition, deep and shallow ponded water depth treatments (15 and 5 cm water depth over the beds) were imposed on the rice on beds during the reproductive period. A range of nitrogen (N) fertiliser rates (0–180 kg N/ha) was applied to all treatments. The traditional flat flooded treatment (Flat) achieved the highest grain yield of 12.7 t/ha, followed by the deep (Bed 15) and shallow (Bed 5) ponded beds (10.2 and 10.1 t/ha, respectively). The furrow (Furrow) irrigated bed treatment yielded 9.4 t/ha and the furrow/drip (Furr/Drip) treatment yielded the lowest grain yield (8.3 t/ha). Grain yield from all bed treatments was reduced owing to the wide furrows (0.8 m between edge rows on adjacent beds), which were not planted to rice. Rice crop water use was significantly different between the layout–irrigation treatments. The Flat, Bed 5 and Bed 15 treatments had similar input (irrigation + rainfall – surface drainage) water use (mean of 18.3 ML/ha). The water use for the Furrow treatment was 17.2 ML/ha and for the Furr/Drip treatment, 15.1 ML/ha. Input WP of the Flat treatment (0.68 t/ML) was higher than the raised bed treatments, which were all similar (mean 0.55 t/ML). This single season experiment shows that high yielding rice crops can be successfully grown on raised beds, but when beds are ponded after panicle initiation, there is no water saving compared with rice grown on a conventional flat layout. Preliminary recommendations for the growing of rice on raised beds are that the crop be grown as a flooded crop in a bankless channel layout. This assists with weed control and allows flooding for cold temperature protection, which is necessary with current varieties. Until we find effective herbicides and other methods of weed control and N application that do not require ponding, there is little scope for saving water while maintaining yield on suitable rice soil through the use of beds."
flat earth,"The end of the world as we know it. Once upon a time, not very long ago, economic globalization - the free worldwide flow of capital, goods, and labor - looked both inevitable and inexorable. Most governments seemed to embrace the very real benefits being offered by rapid technological change and international markets and sought to liberalize their economies in order to maximize these gains. Policymakers worked to prepare their societies for a world of ever-increasing interconnectedness and relentless competition, and the debate - at least within the United States - started to revolve around how to cope with the effects of this new ""flat"" earth."
flat earth,"Surface waves are increasingly used for shallow seismic surveys—in particular, in acoustic logging, environmental, and engineering applications. These waves are dispersive, and their dispersion curves are used to obtain shear velocity profiles with depth. The main obstacle to their more widespread use is the complexity of the associated data processing and interpretation of the results. Our objective is to show that energy reassignment in the time-frequency domain helps improve the precision of group velocity measurements of surface waves. To show this, full-waveform seismograms with added white noise for a shallow flat-layered earth model are analyzed by classic and reassigned multiple filter analysis (MFA). Classic MFA gives the expected smeared image of the group velocity dispersion curve, while the reassigned curve gives a very well-constrained, narrow dispersion curve. Systematic errors from spectral fall-off are largely corrected by the reassignment procedure. The subsequent inversion of the dispersion curve to obtain the shear-wave velocity with depth is carried out through a procedure combining linearized inversion with a nonlinear Monte Carlo inversion. The diminished uncertainty obtained after reassignment introduces significantly better constraints on the earth model than by inverting the output of classic MFA. The reassignment is finally carried out on data from a shallow seismic survey in northern Belgium, with the aim of determining the shear-wave velocities for seismic risk assessment. The reassignment is very stable in this case as well. The use of reassignment can make dispersion measurements highly automated, thereby facilitating the use of surface waves for shallow surveys"
flat earth,"ABSTRACT Trace element inversion modelling of Grenvillean anorthosite massifs and associated rocks yield NMORB-normalised trace element profiles enriched in highly incompatible elements; commonly with negative Nb and Th anomalies. Model melts can be divided into subtypes that cannot be linked through fractional crystallisation processes. Most model melts are depleted in the heavy rare-earth elements and can be explained by partial melting of arc basaltic sources (5–60 melting ) with garnet-bearing residues. Some of the model melts have flat NMORB-normalised profiles (for rare-earth elements), have high compatible element contents, and might have been derived from mantle fertilised by arc magmatism, followed by low-pressure fractional crystallisation. Intermediate Ce/Yb types may represent mixtures of these end-members, or less probably, variations in the crustal source composition and residual assemblage. The active tectonic context now favoured for the Grenville Province appears to be inconsistent with plume or thermal insulation models. The heat source for crustal and mantle melting could record either post-orogenic thermal relaxation of a tectonically-thickened arc crust, or basaltic underplating caused by delamination of a mantle root or subduction slab beneath this arc crust. In this context, pre-Proterozoic anorthosites may be lacking, because prior to ca. 2·5 Ga, the crust may have been too weak to be thickened tectonically. The absence of post-Proterozoic anorthosites may be due to the secular decrease in radiogenic heating and cooling of the mantle and crust."
flat earth,"Improved geometric accuracy in SAR sensors implies that more complex models of the Earth may be used not only to geometrically rectify imagery, but also to more robustly calibrate their radiometry. Current beta, sigma, and gamma nought SAR radi-ometry conventions all assume a simple “flat as Kansas” Earth ellipsoid model. We complement these simple models with improved radiometric calibration that accounts for local terrain variations. In the era of ERS-1 and RADARSAT-1, image geolo-cation accuracy was in the order of multiple samples, and tiepoint-free establishment of the relationship between radar and map geometries was not possible. Newer sensors such as ASAR, PALSAR, and TerraSAR-X all support accurate geolocation based on product annotations alone. We show that high geolocation accuracy, combined with availability of high-resolution accurate elevation models, enables a more robust radiometric calibration standard for modern SAR sensors that is based on gamma nought normalised using an Earth terrain-model."
flat earth,"[1] An algorithm, Determination of Earth Surface Structures (DEST), is presented to reconstruct digital terrain models of complex landforms from topographic data, such as contour lines and spot heights. The algorithm provides a triangular irregular network (TIN) of the source data, based on a modified Delaunay approach. Delaunay triangulation can introduce artificial terraces from a nonrandom distribution of input points such as a sampled contour line. The algorithm proposed here constructs the three-dimensional principal skeletons of these artificial flat areas, eliminating the unwanted effects of contour lines. The algorithm can also be applied to topographic data from a variety of mixed sources such as photogrammetric information, radar altimetry measurements, and traditional contour lines. The sparse fine-surface structures present in the source data are preserved, allowing accurate morphological evaluations, tectonic lineament extraction, and volume estimation. A methodology (D-DEST) to easily derive, from a TIN computed by DEST, the drainage path and the catchment areas is also presented. A comparison of DEST with other methodologies is performed. It results that our approach does not introduce sensible biased effects in slopes, aspects, drainage network, and catchment areas. The evolution of the upper cone of Vesuvius volcano (Italy) during the last century, as derived from historical cartography, is presented as an application of DEST. The algorithm implemented in C can be requested at DEST_pareschi@pi.ingv.it."
flat earth,"Abstract The navigation correction method proposed in Testud et al. (referred to as the THL method) systematically identifies uncertainties in the aircraft Inertial Navigation System and errors in the radar-pointing angles by analyzing the radar returns from a flat and stationary earth surface. This paper extends the THL study to address 1) error characteristics on the radar display, 2) sensitivity of the dual-Doppler analyses to navigation errors, 3) fine-tuning the navigation corrections for individual flight legs, and 4) identifying navigation corrections over a flat and nonstationary earth surface (e.g., ocean). The results show that the errors in each of the parameters affect the dual-Doppler wind analyses and the first-order derivatives in different manners. The tilt error is the most difficult parameter to determine and has the greatest impact on the dual-Doppler analysis. The extended THL method can further reduce the drift, ground speed, and tilt errors in all flight legs over land by analyzing t..."
flat earth,"The flat dilatometer (DMT) test was introduced by Marchetti (1980) as a new in situ penetration test for soils. The equipment and test procedures are simple, and the test provides repeatable, nearly continuous data that has been empirically correlated to soil type, undrained shear strength (su), coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K0), overconsolidation ratio (OCR), and constrained modulus (M). To better understand the measurements from the DMT, a research flat dilatometer was developed at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The research dilatometer is identical in size, shape, and operation to the Marchetti blade except that instrumentation was added which made passive measurements of pore pressure and deflection at the centre of the membrane, inflation pressure at the membrane, verticality of the blade, and penetration force immediately above the blade. Results from several well-documented sites near Vancouver, British Columbia, using the research DMT are presented and discussed. Results from t..."
flat earth,"A discussion is presented of quantitative expressions required for the response of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to both point and distributed scatterers for purposes such as calibration and polarimetry. Image gains depend on the viewing geometry, which is unlike the flat Earth case, which often is assumed to apply in an orbital geometry. Image signal-to-noise ratio is dependent on footprint velocity, but the mean clutter-to-noise ratio for distributed scatterers is dependent on spacecraft velocity. When imagery of a distributed scene observed by an orbital SAR is to be calibrated by comparison to the impulse response of a reference point scatterer, for example, the velocity ratio enters the expression for peak power, but does not enter when an integral is used over the impulse response. The author also looks at the processing gain resulting from overlapping image pixels in azimuth through sampling of the pulse repetition frequency. >"
flat earth,"The 3-D interpretation problem of natural‐source electromagnetic (EM) induction field data collected over a flat air‐earth boundary is dealt with using the concept of probability tomography. This paper presents a method to recognize the most probable localization of the induced electric charge accumulations across resistivity discontinuities and current channeling inside conductive bodies. We begin by writing the solutions for the electric (magnetic) ground surface EM field components in the frequency domain as a sum of elementary contributions, each resulting from a single induced‐charge (dipole) element. Then we express the total electric (magnetic) power associated with each EM field component as a sum of crosscorrelation integrals between the measured component and the homologous synthetic expression resulting from each causative induced‐charge (dipole) element. The synthetic component takes the key role of scanner function in the new imaging procedure. Moreover, using the crosscorrelation bounding in..."
flat earth,"The classical Sommerfeld problem of electromagnetic wave propagation over a flat earth is reformulated by using the electromagnetic compensation theorem. The solution is carried through without recourse to the usual spectral representation of the potential function, and therefore complicated contour integrations are avoided in the subsequent evaluation. Using reciprocity and duality, the complete electromagnetic fields are calculated for elemental vertical or horizontal dipoles of both electric and magnetic types, which are elevated above an arbitrary but passive surface impedance such as that corresponding to homogeneous, horizontally stratified, or uniformly rough surfaces. The results are identical to the little known but more accurate work of Norton, and under certain approximations they reduce to the more well-known results of Norton, Hufford, Bremmer, and others. The restrictions on the impedance properties of the surface are given, and certain direction finding errors are discussed. It is shown that the index of refraction contrast between the upper and lower medium need not be large."
flat earth,"INTRODUCTION: MYTH AND COSMOLOGY Greek philosophical cosmology did not originate completely out of the blue. The first philosophical cosmologists - usually referred to as Ionian or Milesian cosmologists because they worked in Miletus, in Ionia - could react against, or sometimes build upon, popular conceptions that had existed in the Greek world for a long time. Some of these popular conceptions can be gleaned from the poetry of Homer and Hesiod (eighth century B.C.). In Homer the cosmos is conceived as a flat earth, surrounded by the Ocean (Okeanos), and overlooked by a hemispherical sky, with sun, moon, and stars. In the eighth century the annual course of the sun and the rising and setting of some constellations were integrated into a primitive seasonal calendar. Lunations were used for small-scale calendrical purposes (“the twenty-seventh of the month is best for opening a wine-jar” Hesiod Works and Days 814) and at some point - although there are no traces of this in Homer of Hesiod - some form of lunisolar calendar was established."
flat earth,"Summary. A simple method is presented which combines the reciprocity theorem and the flat layer theory to yield teleseismic body wave radiation from seismic sources embedded in the Earth's crust. The source is represented by its equivalent body forces and can be quite general. The effect of Yucca Flat geology on explosion signals is studied in detail. In particular, the mb—Ms relation is shown to be dependent on detonation medium and source depth. Application to shallow earthquake faults demonstrates the strong influence of free surface and layering on the shape of P- and S-wave teleseismic spectra."
flat earth,"The theoretical solution to the problem of radiation from a pulsed vertical dipole over a flat homogeneous earth is employed to study the changes in rise times and the attenuation of the initial peaks of the radiation fields from lightning constructed according to the most recent experimental data on lightning return stroke radiation fields. Expected changes in rise times and the attenuation of the initial peaks for different values of distances and conductivities are presented. It is shown that for a given initial rise time there is a spread in distant rise times due to the variability of the shapes of the radiation fields. The expected spread in distant rise times for different values of distances and conductivities is calculated. The results show the importance of taking into account the propagation effects in any attempt to estimate return stroke current parameters such as rise time, rate of rise, and peak current from radiation fields which propagated over land. The predictions are compared with the available experimental data, and a good agreement is found between them."
flat earth,"Phenolate and phenoxyl radical complexes of a series of alkaline earth metal ions as well as monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+ have been prepared by using 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(1,4,7,10-tetraoxa-13-aza-cyclopentadec-13-ylmethyl)phenol (L1H) and 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxa-16-aza-cyclooctadec-16-ylmethyl)phenol (L2H) to examine the effects of the cations on the structure, physicochemical properties and redox reactivity of the phenolate and phenoxyl radical complexes. Crystal structures of the Mg2+- and Ca2+-complexes of L1- as well as the Ca2+- and Sr2+-complexes of L2- were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis, showing that the crown ether rings in the Ca2+-complexes are significantly distorted from planarity, whereas those in the Mg2+- and Sr2+-complexes are fairly flat. The spectral features (UV-vis) as well as the redox potentials of the phenolate complexes are also influenced by the metal ions, depending on the Lewis acidity of the metal ions. The phenoxyl radical complexes are successfully generated in situ by the oxidation of the phenolate complexes with (NH4)(2)[Ce4+(NO3)6] (CAN). They exhibited strong absorption bands around 400 nm together with a broad one around 600-900 nm, the latter of which is also affected by the metal ions. The phenoxyl radical-metal complexes are characterized by resonance Raman, ESI-MS, and ESR spectra, and the metal ion effects on those spectroscopic features are also discussed. Stability and reactivity of the phenoxyl radical-metal complexes are significantly different, depending on the type of metal ions. The disproportionation of the phenoxyl radicals is significantly retarded by the electronic repulsion between the metal cation and a generated organic cation (Ln+), leading to stabilization of the radicals. On the other hand, divalent cations decelerate the rate of hydrogen atom abstraction from 10-methyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (AcrH2) and its 9-substituted derivatives (AcrHR) by the phenoxyl radicals. On the basis of primary kinetic deuterium isotope effects and energetic consideration of the electron-transfer step from AcrH2 to the phenoxyl radical-metal complexes, we propose that the hydrogen atom abstraction by the phenoxyl radical-alkaline earth metal complexes proceeds via electron transfer followed by proton transfer."
flat earth,"A four-dimensional relativistic positioning system for a general spacetime is constructed by using the so-called emission coordinates. The results apply in a small region around the world line of an accelerated observer carrying a Fermi triad, as described by the Fermi metric. In the case of a Schwarzschild spacetime modeling the gravitational field around the Earth and an observer at rest at a fixed spacetime point, these coordinates realize a relativistic positioning system alternative to the current GPS system. The latter is indeed essentially conceived as Newtonian, so that it necessarily needs taking into account at least the most important relativistic effects through post-Newtonian corrections to work properly. Previous results concerning emission coordinates in flat spacetime are thus extended to this more general situation. Furthermore, the mapping between spacetime coordinates and emission coordinates is completely determined by means of the world function, which in the case of a Fermi metric can be explicitly obtained."

This paper presents and discusses the design, fabrication, and evaluation of two novel bio-inspired climbing robots. Both are inspired by the locomotion of Geckos, a highly skilled natural climber. They are developed for terrestrial and extra-terrestrial environments, and their kinematics is inspired by the Geckos’ gait. The first relatively large robot actuated by conventional motors is designed to operate at both in Earth and space scenarios. The second robot, whose motion is controlled using shape memory alloy actuators and size can be miniaturized to few centimeters scale, is designed for terrestrial applications. Preliminary prototypes of these robots are developed, demonstrated, and evaluated by steep and flat acrylic surface climbing tests. Current robots can successfully climb up to 65 ° slopes at 2 cm/sec speeds."
flat earth,"Hypervelocity impacts of cosmic projectiles larger than ∼200 m diameter are capable of forming complex craters on Earth. At these craters, shock loading, shock damage, and excavation flow are followed by a gravity-driven collapse of the deep transient cavity. Such impact structures are characterized by a central uplift, a flat crater floor, and a terraced crater rim. Collapse-induced deformation features, like folds and brittle fault zones, have many similarities to tectonic structures. Typical deformation patterns of complex terrestrial impact craters of 5–15 km diameter are compiled and analyzed with respect to their kinematic development. Unlike their tectonic counterparts, deformation structures are always the result of non-plane-strain deformation and are formed in a single event that takes place in seconds to minutes. To understand the high-strain-rate processes, the microstructure of an impact-induced fold of the Crooked Creek impact crater (∼7 km diameter), Missouri, United States, is investigated in detail. A period of 20–30 s at the most is determined for the collapse phase of this crater. The gross plastic deformation behavior of the fold is achieved by localized brittle deformation along millimeter- to centimeter-spaced fault zones, forming a network of veins. Shock damage has fractured ∼40% of grain boundaries. The onset of collapse and associated deformation started in rocks with a reduced cohesion and is friction controlled."
flat earth,"[1] We investigate the long-period source spectra of oceanic transform earthquakes and find that previously proposed slow rupture components can be explained as artifacts generated by the modeling procedure. We use low-frequency (≤20 mHz) Rayleigh and Love waves to calculate the amplitude spectra of five earthquakes on the Romanche and Chain transform faults in the equatorial mid-Atlantic Ocean. We find that errors and approximations in the centroid depth, focal mechanism, and earth structure at the source have significant effects on the shape of the source spectra. If global catalog values and an average crustal model are assumed, the spectra exhibit apparent anomalous energy at long periods which has previously been interpreted as a result of slow rupture. We recalculate the source spectra using precise, independently determined depths and moment tensors and a more realistic oceanic crustal structure in the source region. The resulting source spectra are flat at long periods with no indication of anomalous long-period energy. Our results imply that oceanic transform earthquakes do not commonly have detectable slow rupture components."
flat earth,"Precursors to the 1991 Eruptions On July 16, 1990, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake (comparable in size to the great 1906 San Francisco, California, earthquake) struck about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Mount Pinatubo on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, shaking and squeezing the Earth’s crust beneath the volcano. At Mount Pinatubo, this major earthquake caused a landslide, some local earthquakes, and a short-lived increase in steam emissions from a preexisting geothermal area, but otherwise the volcano seemed to be continuing its 500-year-old slumber undisturbed. In March and April 1991, however, molten rock (magma) rising toward the surface from more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) beneath Pinatubo triggered small The Eruptions From June 7 to 12, the first magma reached the surface of Mount Pinatubo. Because it had lost most of the gas contained in it on the way to the surface (like a bottle of soda pop gone flat), the magma oozed out to form a lava dome but did not cause an explosive eruption. However, on June 12 (Philippine Independence Day), millions of cubic yards of gas-charged magma reached the surface and exploded in the reawakening volcano’s first spectacular eruption. When even more highly gas charged magma reached Pinatubo’s surface on June 15, the volcano exploded in a cataclysmic eruption that ejected more than 1 cubic mile (5 cubic kilometers) of material. The ash cloud from this climactic eruption rose 22 miles (35 kilometers) into the air. At lower altitudes, the ash was blown in all directions by the intense cyclonic winds of a coincidentally occurring typhoon, and winds at higher altitudes blew the ash southwestward. A blanket of A huge cloud of volcanic ash and gas rises above Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, on June 12, 1991. Three days later, the volcano exploded in the second-largest volcanic eruption on Earth in this century. Timely forecasts of this eruption by scientists from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and the U.S. Geological Survey enabled people living near the volcano to evacuate to safer distances, saving at least 5,000 lives."
flat earth,"Productivity studies have shown that plants with marked vertical extension of photosynthetic crown can be more productive per unit area of land or water occupied than plants whose photosynthetic surface is spread in a thin horizontal sheet on the earth's surface if environmental factors are not otherwise limiting. Geometric models including a flat disc and cones of several heights but constant base radius show that heightening cones intercept progressively more light. Amount of chlorophyll displayed per unit area of earth's surface can also increase greatly with vertical extension of aerial crown. These observations suggest that thickness, geometric configuration, and chlorophyll content of the photosynthetic portion of the vegetation per unit area of earth's surface, and light intensity incident on surfaces at right angles to sun's rays should be measured and described as basic data in primary productivity studies.

flat earth,"A neotectonic joint is a crack which propagated in a tectonic stress field that has persisted with little or no change of orientation until the present day. Investigating neotectonic joints is of value because the approximate orientation of the contemporary stress field can be inferred from them. Although exposed neotectonic joints in the flat-lying sedimentary rocks of some cratons are related to regional stress fields, their initiation and propagation occurred close to the Earth’s surface. For example, neotectonic joints in the centre of the Ebro basin (N. Spain) preferentially developed in a thin, near-surface channel sited within a sequence of weak Miocene limestones underlying the upper levels of plateaux. The Ebro basin joints strike uniformly NNW-SSE throughout an area of at least 10 000 km2 and they are parallel or subparallel to the direction of greatest horizontal stress extrapolated from in situ stress measurements and fault-plane solutions of earthquakes."

flat earth,"Venera 13 and Venera 14 have determined for the first time ever the elemental composition of the Venusian rocks at the probes' landing sites. To study Venusian rocks, rolling upland and flat lowland have been chosen as the most typical of the entire planetary surface. Venera 13 landed on the rolling upland, while Venera 14 landed in the region with lower topography. The chemical composition of the rock at the Venera 13 landing site proved to be similar to the composition of potassium alkaline basalts of the earth's crust, rocks which can be found on oceanic islands and in rift zones. The chemical composition of the rock at the Venera 14 landing site is similar to that of tholeiitic basalts of the oceanic crust of the earth. The comparison of new data on the composition of Venusian rocks with the composition of the rocks of similar provinces on the earth and the moon shows that the evolution of the surface and crust of Venus was not similar to that of the earth and especially not that of the moon."
flat earth,"Observations of the Earth's thermospheric dayglow were obtained on August 10, 1982, from Poker Flat, Alaska, using a rocket-borne spectrometer covering the wavelength range 1950 to 2170 A. This part of the spectrum is dominated by emissions from the gamma, delta and epsilon bands of nitric oxide. Column densities of nitric oxide were determined by fitting these bands with synthetic spectra. At low altitudes the (1, 0) and (2, 0) gamma bands exhibit large self-absorption. Three bands of the weak NO epsilon system, (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) were positively identified and used to determine NO densities between 105 and 125 km. The fluorescence efficiency of the NO delta bands was found to be ∼0.25 based on the fit to synthetic spectra. A one-dimensional diffusive photochemical model of the earth's thermosphere was used for comparison with the rocket observations. The data was reproduced by the model using a 10 keV characteristic energy for the primary aurora electrons with a constant flux of 0.5 ergs cm−2 s−1. The production yield of N(²D) from the dissociation of N2 by electron impact used in this calculation was 0.6. An analysis was performed to show the sensitivity of the conclusions to the various model parameters."
flat earth,"The river Ganges and its tributaries, and the flat and fertile plain through which they flow, are one of earth's great natural resources. For thousands of years abundant water and generous land have provided the foundation for a highly developed civilization based on agriculture and for one of the world's largest concentrations of human populations. But farming is mainly traditional and at a subsistence level, with little surplus, and as a result the population has remained overwhelmingly rural and most people are desperately poor. Although irrigation from canals and wells has been practiced for millennia, chiefly as a protection against the uncertainties of the monsoon rains, the water resources are largely untapped; the small fraction of water used for irrigation is poorly managed and its productivity is low. Deeply embedded cultural, social, and economic problems inhibit modernization of agriculture and fuller utilization of the water resources. Capital investments and technological changes on a large scale are also required. As experience elsewhere shows, the introduction of technological changes on the required scale might break the chains of tradition and injustice that now bind the people in misery and poverty."

flat earth,"Four distinct granitic series developed during the evolution of the Archean Abitibi Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ): (1) A minor synvolcanic tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) series was emplaced at ~2700 Ma, which has extremely low K2O (<1.5 wt.%), Rb (<50 ppm), and Sr (<200 ppm), higher Nb, Y, and Sc, flat rare-earth-element (REE) patterns, and negative Eu anomalies. (2) A voluminous tonalite – granodiorite – granite – quartz monzonite (TGGM) series developed syntectonically at ~2695–2685 Ma, and displays low K2O (1–3 wt.%), Rb (10–50 ppm), Ba (<1000 ppm), and U, enhanced Sr, depletion of Ta, Nb, and Ti, and strongly fractionated REE patterns (La/Ybn = 49–21). (3) A late-tectonic quartz syenite – quartz monzonite – granite (SMG) series was emplaced from ~2685 to 2675 Ma, and is grossly similar to the TGGM but has lower CaO/(K2O + Na2O) and greater concentrations of Rb, Ba, Th, and U.

flat earth,"We argue that we may be able to sort out dark matter models in which electrons are generated through the annihilation and/or decay of dark matter, by using a fact that the initial energy spectrum is reflected in the cosmic-ray electron flux observed at the Earth even after propagation through the Galactic magnetic field. To illustrate our idea we focus on three representative initial spectra: monochromatic, flat and double-peak ones. We find that those three cases result in significantly different energy spectra, which may be probed by the Fermi satellite in operation or an up-coming cosmic-ray detector such as CALET."
flat earth,"A model with four layered media is developed for the calculation of the radio loss in forests. In this model two lossy dielectric layers placed over a conducting flat earth are used to represent the crown and the trunk of the trees. Dyadic Green's functions in their eigenfunction expansion forms are used to analyze this model, and the electromagnetic fields are obtained from these functions. The theoretical results of the radio loss for vertical and horizontal radiating dipoles and for typical forests agree with the available experimental data. For this comparison the parameters for the layer representing the crown of the trees were estimated."
flat earth,"FOR more than a century we have founded cities and built up industries and opened up new areas for trade and agriculture without paying attention to the land itself. OUR attention has been engrossed by factories, markets, building lots ; and, as a geographer has said, we have treated the theatre of history, the land, as if it were a flat platform extended into interplanetary ether. While we laugh at the people of the Middle Ages because they thought the earth was flat, we ourselves have acted as if the contours of its rotundity were non-existent. Particularly in the more newly settled portions of the earth, and above all in America, we have disregarded the fundamental basis of our existence. We have planned our cities in rectangles ; we have laid out great territories in quarter sections; in general, we have treated the land itself as if it were a vague shadow cast by growing cities. If the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are properly called the era of geographical discovery, the nineteenth century might well be named the period of terrestrial neglect. In the very act of seizing all the habitable parts of the earth, we have systematically misused and neglected our possession."
flat earth,"Santa Barbara Research Center has been exploring the technology related to the design, tolerance, and alignment of wide-field, all-reflecting sensors for multispectral earth observation. The goals of this study are to design an optical system with reduced fabrication risks, to develop a detailed tolerance budget, and to demonstrate our ability to align the system to a tolerance of 0.05 waves rms, at 0.6328 microns. The optical system is a three-mirror, unobscured telescope. It is telecentric and flat field over 15 degrees at F/4.5, and achieves diffraction-limited imagery at visible wavelengths. A separate paper 1 describes the design and error budget approach for the telescope. This paper reports on the effort that led to the alignment of a scaled, prototype optical system. The approach used interferometric measurements of the wavefront at multiple field points and a computer alignment algorithm to define the rigid-body adjustments of the mirrors to achieve the alignment goal."

flat earth,"Abstract A theory of the depth-averaged currents and sea surface elevation generated by a moving hurricane in a stratified ocean with flat bottom is presented. Using a scale analysis of the depth-integrated momentum and continuity equations, it is found that the depth-averaged currents are nearly nondivergent and determined entirely by the wind stress curl. Earth's rotation and ocean stratification have negligible effects. The sea surface elevation is decomposed into four physically different parts caused by geostrophic adjustment to the depth-averaged currents, wind stress divergence, inverted barometer offset, and baroclinic effects. When a hurricane moves with a uniform speed, it generates quasi-stationary, alongtrack, elongated depth-averaged currents. The sea surface elevation remaining after the hurricane passage is a combination of a trough geostrophically adjusted with the depth-averaged currents and a sea surface elevation associated with baroclinic effects. The barotropic response is analysed fo..."
flat earth,"Summary 
 
Some plates deform across zones that are many hundreds to thousands of kilometres wide, much broader than traditional boundaries such as mid-ocean ridges, deep-sea trenches and oceanic transform faults, across which most deformation is concentrated in a zone just a few kilometres wide. These wide zones of deformation, commonly referred to as diffuse plate boundaries, occur in both continental and oceanic lithosphere. Composite plates are composed of two or more rigid, or nearly rigid, component plates separated by one or more diffuse plate boundaries (Royer & Gordon 1997); such ‘complete’ diffuse boundaries are terminated at both ends by triple junctions (although there are other diffuse boundaries that transform into narrow boundaries). Here we consider the dynamics of complete diffuse oceanic plate boundaries by constructing simple analytical models on a flat earth and on a spherical earth assuming that the viscous force resisting deformation is described by either a linear Newtonian law or a high-exponent power law. 
 
 
 
We investigate the observed tendency for the pole of relative motion between component plates separated by a diffuse plate boundary to lie within the diffuse boundary itself. We show that this tendency is due to geometrical effects that make it unlikely that the total torque acting between plates at a diffuse boundary could be oriented such that relative rotation occurs between the plates about a pole lying outside the boundary. This is demonstrated for both flat and spherical earth cases, assuming that resistance to strain along the diffuse boundary increases linearly with stress (Newtonian rheology). We further show that the pole of rotation is even more likely to lie in the diffuse plate boundary if the viscous force resisting deformation is described by a high-exponent power law rather than a Newtonian law."
flat earth,"New formulas for the electric and magnetic fields produced by the four elementary dipole antennas have been developed for the subsurface-to-subsurface propagation case. The formulas are of rather simple, but useful, form and are completely general (i.e., the air can easily be replaced by the sea bottom). They are valid at any frequency and at any range beyond a certain minimum distance for the flat-earth case. They are especially applicable at extremely low frequency (ELF) for the air/sea and sea/ seabed propagatipn cases. The main restrictions on these formulas are 1) the square of the index of refraction is greater than or equal to 10 and 2) the horizontal separation is greater than or equal to 3 times the sum of the depths of burial of the transmitting and receiving point sources. With these new formulas, computer evaluation can be reduced to fractions of a minute, compared with hours for the complete numerical evaluation of the exact Sommerfeld integrals. The formulas also exhibit an interference pattern set up under certain close-range conditions. The three waves (direct, modified mirror image, and lateral) may interfere, either constructively or destructively, with each other."
flat earth,"Expressions are derived for the transient fields of a short vertical antenna, situated on a smooth spherical conducting earth, and energized by a current which is discontinuous in time. When the antenna current is a linear function of time, the radiation field on a flat perfectly conducting earth is of step-function form. The departure from the step shape of the field is shown to be due to the finite conductivity and dielectric constant of the ground, the induction and static fields of the antenna, and the curvature of the earth."
flat earth,"Abstract The multispectral imager on the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft has been subjected to a comprehensive series of inflight tests to validate its radiometric characteristics measured onground and to characterize instrument stability, pointing, geometric distortion, coalignment with other instruments, and light-scattering characteristics under flight conditions. The results of these tests, described herein, support the conversion of images of 253 Mathilde and 433 Eros into scientifically valid products with known geometric and radiometric characteristics. Key results include stability of dark current during cruise to within 1 data number; stability of the flat field to within the limits of inflight detectability; absolute radiometric accuracy of ∼5%, with no evident systematic change with time; validation of the focal length with an inflight measurement of 166.85 mm, compared to 167.0±0.2 mm derived onground; measurement of coalignment with the near-infrared spectrometer under flight conditions; and quantification of the intensity and distribution of scattered light."
flat earth,The Hutti-Maski schist belt in the eastern Dharwar craton consists predominantly of mafic metavolcanics metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. The amphibolites are tholeiitic in composition with higher abundances of iron and with flat to LREE enriched rare earth patterns. Modelling of major and trace elements suggests that the tholeiitic protoliths were formed from melt enriched mantle sources by different extents of partial melting at pressures -25 kbars. The most common mafic metavolcanics in the three auriferous schist belts of eastern Dharwar craton such as the Kolar. the Ramngiri and the Hutti belts are high-iron tholeiites with LREE enriched rare earth patterns. The gold mineralization in the form of quartz-carbonate veins in the three belts is commonly hosted in high irontholeiitic protoliths. The process of formation of Fe-rich tholeiites. their metamorphism to amphibolites and their subsequent emplacement along terrane boundaries could have provided a favourable geochemical environment for gold mineralization.
flat earth,"Since the steady-state cruise path of an idealized point mass model of an atmospheric vehicle operating in the hypersonic flight regime is dynamically not fuel minimizing, closed periodic paths are numerically determined. By application of second-order conditions for local optimality, a periodic extremal path for a flat Earth is shown to be locally minimizing and produces an improvement in fuel usage of 4.2% over the steady-state cruise path. Application of these second variational conditions to extremal paths for the spherical Earth failed. Nevertheless, these paths produce improved fuel performance over the associated steady-state cruise path. UEL efficient cruise trajectories for aircraft have been a subject of continuous theoretical interest and are becoming one of practical interest as well. The analysis of aircraft trajectories for fuel minimization was first performed in a reduced state space.1""3 By neglecting the altitude and flight path angle dynamics, the equations of motion of a point mass representation of the aircraft motion reduces to the energy-state approximation where energy and fuel mass are the state variables, thrust and velocity (or altitude) are considered the control variables, and range is the independent variable. The first-order dynamics or rates are represented by the rate of change in the energy and fuel with respect to a change in range. The hodograph3 is formed by determining the boundary of reachable rates for admisible values of the control variables at a given energy value (the rates are independent of the fuel). The steady-state cruise fuel performance is given by the value of the fuel mass rate where the hodograph crosses the zero energy rate axis. If the hodograph is not convex so that a straight line tangent to two points on the hodograph (called the convex hull3) crosses the zero energy rate axis at a smaller value of fuel mass rate than does the hodograph, then the control variables at the points of tangency are used to form a chattering control sequence which theoretically will improve fuel performance over the steadystate cruise path. This chattering sequence, first discussed in Ref. 1, is an unrealizable infinite frequency control sequence between two thrust levels and two altitude and velocity points on the energy manifold where the aircraft is aerodynamic or propulsion efficient. This chattering cruise is also referred to as the relaxed steady state cruise in Ref. 2. Since velocity and altitude chattering is unrealizable, altitude has been added as a state variable in Ref. 4 and thrust and flight path angle are considered the control variables. In Ref. 4 the small angle approximation applied to the flight path angle results in flight path angle and thrust appearing linearly in the aircraft dynamic model and cost function. These control variables which lie interior to their admissible control sets along the extremizing steady-state cruise path form what is called a doubly singular arc in the calculus of variations.5'6 By applications of the matrix generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition due to Robbins, 7 it is demonstrated in Ref. 8 that the steady-state cruise path is not minimizing.."

flat earth,"A theoretical determination of the path loss in radio propagation through jungle is obtained by considering the jungle as a homogeneous conducting dielectric slab on a flat earth. An exact integral is obtained for the vertical component of the electric field within the jungle due to a vertical electric dipole within the jungle. An analytic evaluation of the integral leads to an approximate expression for the field and an estimate of the error. When this accuracy is insufficient, a numerical evaluation of the integral is performed. The combination of analytic and numerical techniques leads to the evaluation of the electric field and thereby path loss to any accuracy desired. Experimental measurements of path loss in a Thailand jungle are compared with the calculations. The results agree within a standard deviation of 6 dB when the jungle conductivity is taken as 0.15 mmho/m."
flat earth,"A method is presented for reconstructing the 3-D geometry of a road from a single image of the road. This problem has an infinity of solutions unless restrictive hypotheses about geometric characteristics of this road are assumed. The road is modeled as a space ribbon defined by a spine (centerline) and generators (cross-segments) which are horizontal line segments cutting the spine at their midpoint at a normal angle. Properties of two neighboring generators of such a ribbon are examined; if a generator is known, a neighboring generator is completely defined if one of its ends is known. The proposed method uses this property to reconstruct the visible part of the world road, by iteratively finding a series of generators. This method is tested against a simple method which assumes that the ground is flat (""Flat Earth assumption""), and against another method which uses vanishing points."
flat earth,"Summary Dykes from four sections across the axis of the Skye regional swarm have been analysed for major elements, Nb, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and rare-earth elements. 70 % of the dykes are characterized by relatively high CaO (11–12%), and low abundance of elements such as TiO2 (∼1%), K2O (0·05–0·20 %), Zr (30–60 ppm), with a light-rare-earth depleted chondrite normalized pattern. The remainder of the swarm comprises dykes equivalent in composition to the Skye Main Lava Series and dykes belonging to a further magma type distinguished by a flat chondrite normalized rare-earth pattern. The high-calcium, low-alkali tholeiite dykes are confined to a narrow persistent zone forming the major axis of dilation of the swarm; other basaltic dykes are axially less persistent and have a wider lateral distribution. The more evolved dykes tend to be restricted to central Skye."
flat earth,"This paper introduces a new algorithm for quickly answering repetitive least-cost queries between pairs of points on the Earth's surface as represented by digital topographical maps. The algorithm uses a three-step process; preprocessing, geometrically modified Dijkstra search, and postprocessing. The preprocessing step computes and saves highly valuable global information that describes the underlying geometry of the terrain. The search step solves shortest path queries using a modified Dijkstra algorithm that takes advantage of the preprocessed information to ""jump"" quickly across flat terrain and decide whether a path should go over or through a high-cost region. The final step is a path improvement process that straightens and globally improves the path. Our algorithm partitions the search space into free regions and obstacle regions. However, unlike other algorithms using this approach, our algorithm keeps the option of passing through an obstacle region."

 Tables for spectral displacements of seismic surface waves from shear dislocations in flat multilayered earth models were prepared. Earth response functions for seven modes (R11, R21, R12, L0, L1, L2, L3) at six periods (300 sec, 250 sec, 200 sec, 150 sec, 100 sec, 50 sec) and three paths (continental, oceanic, shield) were calculated for the source-depth range of 10 to 600 km at intervals of 5 km until 200 km, and thereafter at intervals of 10 km. Ground motion is given in micron-seconds for the three fundamental shear dislocations, each of strength U0dS = 103 (m × km2) and a delta-function time-dependence.

flat earth,"An expression is derived for the mutual impedance between two short vertical antennas on a flat earth with a straight boundary separating two media of differing electrical constants. After making some approximations that are valid at low and medium frequencies and where the antennas are not near the boundary, the integral formula for the field is evaluated for a wide range of the parameters. The numerical results computed in this paper are shown to be in reasonably good agreement with experiment. Finally, the effect of the obliqueness of the boundary is considered by a refinement of the stationary phase evaluation of the integrals."
flat earth,"An extension of Taylor's (1960) circular aperture pattern synthesis technique permits the generation of a flat-topped beam that is rotationally symmetric, surrounded by ring side lobes of controllable height, with the ripple amplitude also controllable. The corresponding continuous aperture distribution can be made pure real by appropriate root-pairing, which makes the results applicable, via sampling, to resonantly-spaced waveguide slot arrays. A one-dimensional linear stretch extends the results to rectangular grid planar arrays possessing an elliptical boundary. In that case the pattern is a flat-topped beam with an elliptical contour, surrounded by ring side lobes also of elliptical contour, but with amplitude and side lobe level still controlled. The principal application is to space vehicle communication systems required to place a footprint pattern on a selected portion of the Earth's surface."
flat earth,"Often the meaning of scientific concepts conflicts with an everyday perspective of events, and individuals (whether child or adult) encounter “critical barriers” in grasping them. Two dimensions contributing to the unobvious meaning of scientific concepts are the problem of scale and the nature of inference about events unobserved. These problems are especially apparent in the teaching of earth science ideas. For example, the flat earth perspective and the common perception of a minimally changing geologic environment, repeatedly pose obstacles to understanding frame of reference thinking and to perceiving the amount of change through geologic time. Children and adults struggle with similar problems as they attempt to progress in understanding the meaning of “unobvious” scientific conceptions."
flat earth,"Sections through an oceanic plateau are preserved in tectonic slices in the Western Cordillera of Ecuador (South America). The San Juan section is a sequence of maficultramafic cumulates. To establish that these plutonic rocks formed in an oceanic plateau setting, we have developed criteria that discriminate intrusions of oceanic plateaus from those of other tectonic settings. The mineralogy and crystallization sequence of the cumulates are similar to those of intra-plate magmas. Clinopyroxene predominates throughout, and orthopyroxene is only a minor component. Rocks of intermediate composition are absent, and hornblende is restricted to the uppermost massive gabbros within the sequence. The ultramafic cumulates are very depleted in light rare-earth elements (LREE), whereas the gabbros have flat or slightly enriched LREE patterns.

These formulas are of rather simple form and reduce to previously derived results when either (1) the measurement distance is much less than a free-space wavelength, (2) the Sommerfeld numerical distance is small, or (3) the measurement distance is much greater than a free-space wavelength. These are valid at any frequency and at any range beyond a certain minimum distance for the flat-earth case"
flat earth,"THE VARIOUS cosmological models along history are briefly reviewed. The evolution of the ideas may be understood as successive models such as the flat earth, the geocentric models as well as the heliocentric and the galacto-centric ones. In the last century, a concept was developed, the big-bang theory, that describes the most sophisticated observations on hand today and shows that the universe had an origin that can be search with scientific methods. In recent decades this model was refined to a new concept: inflation. By the end of the century and millenium new discoveries showed that all known matter is only the tip of the iceberg in a universe dominated by dark energy and dark matter whose natures remain mysterious."
flat earth,"Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) model tests of tunnel excavation with nearby existing foundation are carried out to investigate the influence of the existing foundation due to the interaction between ground and the existing structures. Three types of foundations: flat foundation, group-pile foundation and piled raft are considered. 2D and 3D finite element analyses using subloading tij model are also conducted. The deformation mechanism and distribution of earth pressure during tunnel excavation in the ground with nearby foundation are found to be different from those of green field condition. Surface settlement trough due to tunnel excavation in the ground with existing foundation does not follow the usual pattern of a Gaussian distributive curve, which can be observed in the case of green field. Especially, in the case of pile foundation, Dp, the distance between pile tip and tunnel is an important factor for the ground deformation and surface settlement. For a short distance Dp, although the length of pile is long, the ground deformation is concentrated at a place near the front pile and the rotation of foundation becomes larger. The maximum surface settlement in the case of existing foundation is also larger than those in the case of green field. Due to the existing foundation, unsymmetrical distributions of earth pressure occurred at the bottom of the ground due to tunnel excavation, both in model tests and numerical analyses. The earth pressure at the crown of tunnel in the case of existing foundation is almost the same as those in the case of green field. The arching at the shoulder of tunnel in the case of existing foundation, however, is much larger than those in the case of green field due to the dead load exerted on the foundation. The numerical results agree well with the results of the model tests."

The flat [MgGe2]4- layers propagate in two dimensions (a and c), and they are offset by a distance of 1/4.a with respect to one another and are interspaced with layers of [Ge2]6- dimers and Yb cations filling the space between them. According to the structural and physical property data, Yb4MgGe4 is a heterogeneous mixed-valent compound, i.e. a system where one of the two symmetry-inequivalent Yb sites has atoms in closed-shell Yb2+ configuration, whereas the Yb3+ cations occupy a different crystallographic site."

Both estimates indicate that a low-earth–orbiting nanosatellite with a 0-dB gain UHF antenna will be sensitive to bistatic scatter into space from the irregularities illuminated by the ground-based Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR). It is also shown that the change of scattering geometry due to the satellite motion is sufficiently slow to “lock on” the target. That is, the satellite will acquire a statistically large number of samples in a sufficiently small time window to resolve the scattering signal power as a function of the Bragg scattering angle with respect to the magnetic field lines."
flat earth,"A method for determining tsunami hazard is presented using simple seismological and hydrodynamic models. 

The seismological model assumes that submarine earthquakes of the dipstrike type can occur, with equal likelihood, anywhere along a well-defined straight fault and that the site under consideration lies on the perpendicular bisector of and far removed from the fault. The ground dislocation is circular in the horizontal plane, and the vertical offset is uniform. The radius of the circle and the vertical offset are related to seismic moment which is assumed to be random. 

The hydrodynamic model is based on linear dispersive wave theory. It is assumed that the earth is flat, water depth constant, and ocean infinite in horizontal extent. The maximum elevation of water surface of the leading wave is related to ground motion characteristics (or seismic moment) and the distance from the site to the source. 

The probability of the event that the water elevation at a site exceeds an arbitrary but specified level is then derived and computed. A sensitivity study is performed to determine the importance of various parameters."

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Vaccines have been the main global weapon to minimise the impact of influenza in the elderly for the last four decades and are recommended worldwide for individuals aged 65 years or older. The primary goal of influenza vaccination in the elderly is to reduce the risk of complications among persons who are most vulnerable.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions, complications and mortality in the elderly. To identify and appraise comparative studies evaluating the effects of influenza vaccines in the elderly. To document types and frequency of adverse effects associated with influenza vaccines in the elderly.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 4); MEDLINE (January 1966 to October Week 1 2009); EMBASE (1974 to October 2009) and Web of Science (1974 to October 2009).


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort and case-control studies assessing efficacy against influenza (laboratory-confirmed cases) or effectiveness against influenza-like illness (ILI) or safety. Any influenza vaccine given independently, in any dose, preparation or time schedule, compared with placebo or with no intervention was considered.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We grouped reports first according to the setting of the study (community or long-term care facilities) and then by level of viral circulation and vaccine matching. We further stratified by co-administration of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and by different types of influenza vaccines. We analysed the following outcomes: influenza, influenza-like illness, hospital admissions, complications and deaths.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 75 studies. Overall we identified 100 data sets. We identified one RCT assessing efficacy and effectiveness. Although this seemed to show an effect against influenza symptoms it was underpowered to detect any effect on complications (1348 participants). The remainder of our evidence base included non-RCTs. Due to the general low quality of non-RCTs and the likely presence of biases, which make interpretation of these data difficult and any firm conclusions potentially misleading, we were unable to reach clear conclusions about the effects of the vaccines in the elderly.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
The available evidence is of poor quality and provides no guidance regarding the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years or older. To resolve the uncertainty, an adequately powered publicly-funded randomised, placebo-controlled trial run over several seasons should be undertaken."
vaccines,"Toxoplasmosis caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a major public health problem, infecting one-third of the world human beings, and leads to abortion in domestic animals. A vaccine strategy would be an ideal tool for improving disease control. Many efforts have been made to develop vaccines against T. gondii to reduce oocyst shedding in cats and tissue cyst formation in mammals over the last 20 years, but only a live-attenuated vaccine based on the S48 strain has been licensed for veterinary use. Here, the authors review the recent development of T. gondii vaccines in cats, food-producing animals and mice, and present its future perspectives. However, a single or only a few antigen candidates revealed by various experimental studies are limited by only eliciting partial protective immunity against T. gondii. Future studies of T. gondii vaccines should include as many CTL epitopes as the live attenuated vaccines."
vaccines,"Despite many years of research, human DNA vaccines have yet to fulfill their early promise. Over the past 15 years, multiple generations of DNA vaccines have been developed and tested in preclinical models for prophylactic and therapeutic applications in the areas of infectious disease and cancer, but have failed in the clinic. Thus, while DNA vaccines have achieved successful licensure for veterinary applications, their poor immunogenicity in humans when compared with traditional protein-based vaccines has hindered their progress. Many strategies have been attempted to improve DNA vaccine potency including use of more efficient promoters and codon optimization, addition of traditional or genetic adjuvants, electroporation, intradermal delivery and various prime–boost strategies. This review summarizes these advances in DNA vaccine technologies and attempts to answer the question of when DNA vaccines might eventually be licensed for human use."
vaccines,"Vaccines were initially developed on an empirical basis, relying mostly on attenuation or inactivation of pathogens. Advances in immunology, molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics, and proteomics have added new perspectives to the vaccinology field. The use of recombinant proteins allows the targeting of immune responses focused against few protective antigens. There are a variety of expression systems with different advantages, allowing the production of large quantities of proteins depending on the required characteristics. Live recombinant bacteria or viral vectors effectively stimulate the immune system as in natural infections and have intrinsic adjuvant properties. DNA vaccines, which consist of non-replicating plasmids, can induce strong long-term cellular immune responses. Prime-boost strategies combine different antigen delivery systems to broaden the immune response. In general, all of these strategies have shown advantages and disadvantages, and their use will depend on the knowledge of the mechanisms of infection of the target pathogen and of the immune response required for protection. In this review, we discuss some of the major breakthroughs that have been achieved using recombinant vaccine technologies, as well as new approaches and strategies for vaccine development, including potential shortcomings and risks."
vaccines,"The clinical benefit of therapeutic cancer vaccines has been established. Whereas regression of lesions was shown for premalignant lesions caused by HPV, clinical benefit in cancer patients was mostly noted as prolonged survival. Suboptimal vaccine design and an immunosuppressive cancer microenvironment are the root causes of the lack of cancer eradication. Effective cancer vaccines deliver concentrated antigen to both HLA class I and II molecules of DCs, promoting both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. Optimal vaccine platforms include DNA and RNA vaccines and synthetic long peptides. Antigens of choice include mutant sequences, selected cancer testis antigens, and viral antigens. Drugs or physical treatments can mitigate the immunosuppressive cancer microenvironment and include chemotherapeutics, radiation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors, inhibitors of T cell checkpoints, agonists of selected TNF receptor family members, and inhibitors of undesirable cytokines. The specificity of therapeutic vaccination combined with such immunomodulation offers an attractive avenue for the development of future cancer therapies."
vaccines,"Concurrent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first therapeutic cancer vaccine, a wide spectrum of other cancer vaccine platforms that target a diverse range of tumor-associated antigens is currently being evaluated in randomized phase II and phase III trials. The profound influence of the tumor microenvironment and other immunosuppressive entities, however, can limit the effectiveness of these vaccines. Numerous strategies are currently being evaluated both preclinically and clinically to counteract these immunosuppressive entities, including the combined use of vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors, certain chemotherapeutics, small-molecule targeted therapies, and radiation. The potential influence of the appropriate patient population and clinical trial endpoint in vaccine therapy studies is discussed, as well as the potential importance of biomarkers in future directions of this field."
vaccines,"Influenza vaccines remain the primary public health tool in reducing the ever-present burden of influenza and its complications. In seeking more immunogenic, more effective and more broadly cross-protective influenza vaccines, the landscape of influenza vaccines is rapidly expanding, both in near-term advances and next-generation vaccine design. Although the first influenza vaccines were licensed over 60 years ago, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer is currently the only universally accepted immune correlate of protection against influenza. However, hemagglutination-inhibition titers appear to be less effective at predicting protection in populations at high risk for severe influenza disease; older adults, young children and those with certain medical conditions. The lack of knowledge and validated methods to measure alternate immune markers of protection against influenza remain a substantial barrier to the development of more immunogenic, broadly cross-reactive and effective influenza vaccines. Here, the authors review the knowledge of immune effectors of protection against influenza and discuss assessment methods for a broader range of immunological parameters that could be considered in the evaluation of traditional or new-generation influenza vaccines."
vaccines,"Summary:  This review provides a detailed look at the attributes and immunologic mechanisms of plasmid DNA vaccines and their utility as laboratory tools as well as potential human vaccines. The immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA vaccines in a variety of preclinical models is used to illustrate how they differ from traditional vaccines in novel ways due to the in situ antigen production and the ease with which they are constructed. The ability to make new DNA vaccines without needing to handle a virulent pathogen or to adapt the pathogen for manufacturing purposes demonstrates the potential value of this vaccine technology for use against emerging and epidemic pathogens. Similarly, personalized anti‐tumor DNA vaccines can also readily be made from a biopsy. Because DNA vaccines bias the T‐helper (Th) cell response to a Th1 phenotype, DNA vaccines are also under development for vaccines against allergy and autoimmune diseases. The licensure of four animal health products, including two prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases, one immunotherapy for cancer, and one gene therapy delivery of a hormone for a food animal, provides evidence of the efficacy of DNA vaccines in multiple species including horses and pigs. The size of these target animals provides evidence that the somewhat disappointing immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in a number of human clinical trials is not due simply to the larger mass of humans compared with most laboratory animals. The insights gained from the mechanisms of protection in the animal vaccines, the advances in the delivery and expression technologies for increasing the potency of DNA vaccines, and encouragingly potent human immune responses in certain clinical trials, provide insights for future efforts to develop DNA vaccines into a broadly useful vaccine and immunotherapy platform with applications for human and animal health."
vaccines,"Dengue is among the most prevalent and important arbovirus diseases of humans. To effectively control this rapidly spreading disease, control of the vector mosquito and a safe and efficacious vaccine are critical. Despite considerable efforts, the development of a successful vaccine has remained elusive. Multiple factors have complicated the creation of a successful vaccine, not the least of which are the complex, immune-mediated responses against four antigenically distinct serotypes necessitating a tetravalent vaccine providing long-lasting protective immunity. Despite the multiple impediments, there are currently many promising vaccine candidates in preclinical and clinical development. Here, the recent advances in dengue virus vaccine development are reviewed and the challenges associated with the use of these vaccines as a public health tool are briefly discussed."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae(S. pneumoniae) continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Whilst pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPV) have the potential to prevent disease and death, the degree of protection afforded against various clinical endpoints and within different populations is uncertain.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness of PPV in preventing disease or death in adults. Adverse events were not assessed.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2007); and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).


SELECTION CRITERIA
A) Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PPV with placebo, control vaccines, or no intervention.B) Non-RCTs assessing PPV effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
A) RCTs: trial quality assessment was conducted by two review authors and data extracted by three authors; odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a random-effects model.B) Non-RCTs: study quality, including measures to control for confounding, was assessed and data extracted by two review authors; OR and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effects model following the conversion of each study outcome to a log OR and standard error.


MAIN RESULTS
Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria (15 RCTs involving 48,656 participants and 7 non-RCTs involving 62,294 participants). Meta-analysis of the RCTs found strong evidence of PPV efficacy against IPD with no statistical heterogeneity (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.46; random-effects model, I-squared (I(2)) = 0%). Efficacy against all cause pneumonia was inconclusive with substantial statistical heterogeneity (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97; random-effects model, I(2) = 87.3%). PPV was not associated with substantial reductions in all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.10; random-effects model, I(2) = 75.3%). Vaccine efficacy against primary outcomes appeared poorer in adults with chronic illness but the difference was not statistically significant. Non-RCTs provided evidence for protection against IPD in populations for whom the vaccine is currently utilised (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61; random-effects model, I(2) = 31.4%).


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
This meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the recommendation for PPV to prevent IPD in adults. The evidence from RCTs is less clear with respect to adults with chronic illness. This might be because of lack of effect or lack of power in the studies. The meta-analysis does not provide compelling evidence to support the routine use of PPV to prevent all-cause pneumonia or mortality."
vaccines,"The immune system is redundant, and B and T cells collaborate. However, almost all current vaccines work through induction of antibodies in serum or on mucosa that block infection or interfere with microbial invasion of the bloodstream. To protect, antibodies must be functional in the sense of neutralization or opsonophagocytosis. Correlates of protection after vaccination are sometimes absolute quantities but often are relative, such that most infections are prevented at a particular level of response but some will occur above that level because of a large challenge dose or deficient host factors. There may be >1 correlate of protection for a disease, which we term ""cocorrelates."" Either effector or central memory may correlate with protection. Cell-mediated immunity also may operate as a correlate or cocorrelate of protection against disease, rather than against infection. In situations where the true correlate of protection is unknown or difficult to measure, surrogate tests (usually antibody measurements) must suffice as predictors of protection by vaccines. Examples of each circumstance are given."
vaccines,"Summary:  Our improved understanding of how innate immune responses can be initiated and how they can shape adaptive B‐ and T‐cell responses is having a significant impact on vaccine development by directing the development of defined adjuvants. Experience with first generation vaccines, as well as rapid advances in developing defined vaccines containing Toll‐like receptor ligands (TLRLs), indicate that an expanded number of safe and effective vaccines containing such molecules will be available in the future. In this review, we outline current knowledge regarding TLRs, detailing the different cell types that express TLRs, the various signaling pathways TLRs utilize, and the currently known TLRLs. We then discuss the current status of TLRLs within vaccine development programs, including the importance of appropriate formulation, and how recent developments can be used to better define the mechanisms of action of vaccines. Finally, we introduce the possibility of using TLRLs, either in combination or with non‐TLRLs, to synergistically potentiate vaccine‐induced responses to provide not only prophylactic, but therapeutic protection against infectious diseases and cancer."
vaccines,"It was discovered almost 20 years ago that plasmid DNA, when injected into the skin or muscle of mice, could induce immune responses to encoded antigens. Since that time, there has since been much progress in understanding the basic biology behind this deceptively simple vaccine platform and much technological advancement to enhance immune potency. Among these advancements are improved formulations and improved physical methods of delivery, which increase the uptake of vaccine plasmids by cells; optimization of vaccine vectors and encoded antigens; and the development of novel formulations and adjuvants to augment and direct the host immune response. The ability of the current, or second-generation, DNA vaccines to induce more-potent cellular and humoral responses opens up this platform to be examined in both preventative and therapeutic arenas. This review focuses on these advances and discusses both preventive and immunotherapeutic clinical applications."
vaccines,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the aetiological agent of the acute and highly contagious infectious bursal disease (IBD) or “Gumboro disease”. IBD is one of the economically most important diseases that affects commercially produced chickens worldwide. Along with strict hygiene management of poultry farms, vaccination programmes with inactivated and live attenuated viruses have been used to prevent IBD. Live vaccines show a different degree of attenuation; many of them may cause bursal atrophy and thus immunosuppression with poor immune response to vaccination against other pathogens and an increase in vulnerability to various types of infections as possible consequences. Depending on their intrinsic characteristics or on the vaccination procedures, some of the vaccines may not induce full protection against the very virulent IBDV strains and antigenic variants observed in the last three decades. As chickens are most susceptible to IBDV in their first weeks of life, active immunity to the virus has to be induced early after hatching. However, maternally derived IBDV-specific antibodies may interfere with early vaccination with live vaccines. Thus new technologies and second-generation vaccines including rationally designed and subunit vaccines have been developed. Recently, live viral vector vaccines have been licensed in several countries and are reaching the market. Here, the current status of IBD vaccines is discussed."
vaccines,"Adjuvant use improves the quality and quantity of the immune response to pandemic influenza vaccines. A Shot in the Arm for the Flu Vaccine Because flu vaccine production begins months before the flu season, vaccine producers and world health officials have to guess which strains will predominate in a coming year. Although they’re frequently right, sometimes a dark horse arises that wasn’t predicted, and vaccine makers have to play catch-up. Speed is of the essence when attempting to prevent a pandemic, and limited supplies could hinder a worldwide vaccination campaign, preventing the broad coverage that protects even unvaccinated people. Khurana et al. report that the use of an oil-in-water adjuvant, MF59, improves the magnitude, robustness, and strength of the immune response to pandemic flu vaccines and may decrease the amount of antigen required for each dose. The authors looked at the quantitative and qualitative effects of MF59 on the antibody response in patients from various age groups who were vaccinated with the swine-origin H1N1 flu vaccine. They found that in adults and children who had been either previously vaccinated or exposed to the flu, MF59 increased the diversity and volume of neutralizing antibody responses to the flu vaccine. Antibody responses were slightly different in toddlers, suggesting that there may be distinct requirements for activating primary and recall antibody responses. MF59 also increased the strength with which these antibodies bound to the flu virus. These results support the use of adjuvants with flu vaccinations. Such a strategy could help expand coverage and decrease morbidity in the event of pandemic influenza and give vaccine makers the edge in a game of catch-up with dark horses. Oil-in-water adjuvants have been shown to improve immune responses against pandemic influenza vaccines as well as reduce the effective vaccine dose, increasing the number of doses available to meet global vaccine demand. Here, we use genome fragment phage display libraries and surface plasmon resonance to elucidate the effects of MF59 on the quantity, diversity, specificity, and affinity maturation of human antibody responses to the swine-origin H1N1 vaccine in different age groups. In adults and children, MF59 selectively enhanced antibody responses to the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) globular head relative to the more conserved HA2 domain in terms of increased antibody titers as well as a more diverse antibody epitope repertoire. Antibody affinity, as inferred by greatly diminished (≥10-fold) off-rate constants, was significantly increased in toddlers and children who received the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine. Moreover, MF59 also improved antibody affinity maturation after each sequential vaccination against avian H5N1 in adults. For both pandemic influenza vaccines, there was a close correlation between serum antibody affinity and virus-neutralizing capacity. Thus, MF59 quantitatively and qualitatively enhances functional antibody responses to HA-based vaccines by improving both epitope breadth and binding affinity, demonstrating the added value of such adjuvants for influenza vaccines."
vaccines,"Many vaccines induce protective immunity via antibodies. Recent studies have used systems biological approaches to determine signatures that predict vaccine immunity in humans, but whether there is a ‘universal signature’ that can predict antibody responses to any vaccine, is unknown. Here we performed systems analyses of immune responses to the meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines in healthy adults, in the broader context of our previous studies with the yellow fever and two influenza vaccines. To achieve this, we performed a largescale network integration of public human blood transcriptomes, and systems-scale databases in specific biological contexts, and deduced a set of blood transcription modules. These modules revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different classes of vaccines providing key insights into primary viral, protein recall and anti-polysaccharide responses. These results illuminate the early transcriptional programs orchestrating vaccine immunity in humans, and demonstrate the power of integrative network modeling."
vaccines,"The United States has made tremendous progress in using vaccines to prevent serious, often infectious, diseases. But concerns about such issues as vaccines' safety and the increasing complexity of immunization schedules have fostered doubts about the necessity of vaccinations. We investigated parents' confidence in childhood vaccines by reviewing recent survey data. We found that most parents--even those whose children receive all of the recommended vaccines--have questions, concerns, or misperceptions about them. We suggest ways to give parents the information they need and to keep the US national vaccination program a success."
vaccines,"OBJECTIVES. The goals were (1) to obtain national estimates of the proportions of parents with indicators of vaccine doubt, (2) to identify factors associated with those parents, compared with parents reporting no vaccine doubt indicators, (3) to identify the specific vaccines that prompted doubt and the reasons why, and (4) to describe the main reasons parents changed their minds about delaying or refusing a vaccine for their child. METHODS. Data were from the National Immunization Survey (2003–2004). Groups included parents who ever got a vaccination for their child although they were not sure it was the best thing to do (“unsure”), delayed a vaccination for their child (“delayed”), or decided not to have their child get a vaccination (“refused”). RESULTS. A total of 3924 interviews were completed. Response rates were 57.9% in 2003 and 65.0% in 2004. Twenty-eight percent of parents responded yes to ever experiencing ≥1 of the outcome measures listed above. In separate analyses for each outcome measure, vaccine safety concern was a predictor for unsure, refused, and delayed parents. The largest proportions of unsure and refused parents chose varicella vaccine as the vaccine prompting their concern, whereas delayed parents most often reported “not a specific vaccine” as the vaccine prompting their concern. Most parents who delayed vaccines for their child did so for reasons related to their child's illness, unlike the unsure and refused parents. The largest proportion of parents who changed their minds about delaying or not getting a vaccination for their child listed “information or assurances from health care provider” as the main reason. CONCLUSIONS. Parents who exhibit doubts about immunizations are not all the same. This research suggests encouraging children's health care providers to solicit questions about vaccines, to establish a trusting relationship, and to provide appropriate educational materials to parents."
vaccines,"The immunostimulants 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and the saponin QS-21 are part of licensed or candidate vaccines. MPL and QS-21 directly affect the innate immune response to orchestrate the quality and intensity of the adaptive immune response to the vaccine antigens. The combination of immunostimulants in different adjuvant formulations forms the basis of Adjuvant Systems (AS) as a way to promote appropriate protective immune responses following vaccination. MPL and aluminum salts are present in AS04, and both MPL and QS-21 are present in AS01 and AS02, which are liposome- and emulsion-based formulations, respectively. The recent clinical performance of AS01-, AS02- and AS04-adjuvanted vaccines will be discussed in the context of the diseases being targeted. The licensing of two AS04-adjuvanted vaccines and the initiation of Phase III trials with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine demonstrate the potential to develop new or improved human vaccines that contain MPL or MPL and QS-21."
vaccines,"Peptide vaccines incorporate one or more short or long amino acid sequences as tumor antigens, combined with a vaccine adjuvant. Thus, they fall broadly into the category of defined antigen vaccines, along with vaccines using protein, protein subunits, DNA, or RNA. They remain one of the most immunogenic approaches, based on measures of T-cell response in the blood or in draining lymph nodes. However, existing peptide vaccines have had limited success at inducing clinical tumor regressions, despite reliable induction of T-cell responses. Several new developments offer promise for improving peptide vaccines, including use of long peptides, optimization of adjuvants including toll-like receptor agonists, and combination with systemic therapies that may reduce tumor-associated immune dysfunction, such as blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. To apply these new approaches optimally, it will be critical to study their effects in the context of defined antigens, for which peptide vaccines are optimal."
vaccines,"Licensed vaccines against viral diseases generate antibodies that neutralize the infecting virus and protect against infection or disease. Similarly, an effective vaccine against HIV-1 will likely need to induce antibodies that prevent initial infection of host cells or that limit early events of viral dissemination. Such antibodies must target the surface envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1, which are highly variable in sequence and structure. The first subunit vaccines to enter clinical trails were safe and immunogenic but unable to elicit antibodies that neutralized most circulating strains of HIV-1. However, potent virus neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) can develop during the course of HIV-1 infection, and this is the type of antibody response that researchers seek to generate with a vaccine. Thus, current vaccine design efforts have focused on a more detailed understanding of these broadly neutralizing antibodies and their epitopes to inform the design of improved vaccines."
vaccines,"There is no licenced vaccine against any human parasitic disease and Plasmodium falciparum malaria, a major cause of infectious mortality, presents a great challenge to vaccine developers. This has led to the assessment of a wide variety of approaches to malaria vaccine design and development, assisted by the availability of a safe challenge model for small-scale efficacy testing of vaccine candidates. Malaria vaccine development has been at the forefront of assessing many new vaccine technologies including novel adjuvants, vectored prime-boost regimes and the concept of community vaccination to block malaria transmission. Most current vaccine candidates target a single stage of the parasite's life cycle and vaccines against the early pre-erythrocytic stages have shown most success. A protein in adjuvant vaccine, working through antibodies against sporozoites, and viral vector vaccines targeting the intracellular liver-stage parasite with cellular immunity show partial efficacy in humans, and the anti-sporozoite vaccine is currently in phase III trials. However, a more effective malaria vaccine suitable for widespread cost-effective deployment is likely to require a multi-component vaccine targeting more than one life cycle stage. The most attractive near-term approach to develop such a product is to combine existing partially effective pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidates."
vaccines,"In the last few years, plants have become an increasingly attractive platform for recombinant protein production. This builds on two decades of research, starting with transgenic approaches to develop oral vaccines in which antigens or therapeutics can be delivered in processed plant biomass, and progressing to transient expression approaches whereby high yields of purified targets are administered parenterally. The advantages of plant-based expression systems include high scalability, low upstream costs, biocontainment, lack of human or animal pathogens, and ability to produce target proteins with desired structures and biological functions. Using transgenic and transient expression in whole plants or plant cell culture, a variety of recombinant subunit vaccine candidates, therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, and dietary proteins have been produced. Some of these products have been tested in early phase clinical trials, and show safety and efficacy. Among those are mucosal vaccines for diarrheal diseases, hepatitis B and rabies; injectable vaccines for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, H1N1 and H5N1 strains of influenza A virus, and Newcastle disease in poultry; and topical antibodies for the treatment of dental caries and HIV. As lead plant-based products have entered clinical trials, there has been increased emphasis on manufacturing under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) guidelines, and the preparation and presentation to the relevant government agencies of regulatory packages."

vaccines,"Vaccination plays an important role in large-scale commercial fish farming and has been a key reason for the success of salmon cultivation. In addition to salmon and trout, commercial vaccines are available for channel catfish, European seabass and seabream, Japanese amberjack and yellowtail, tilapia and Atlantic cod. In general, empirically developed vaccines based on inactivated bacterial pathogens have proven to be very efficacious in fish. Fewer commercially available viral vaccines and no parasite vaccines exist. Substantial efficacy data are available for new fish vaccines and advanced technology has been implemented. However, before such vaccines can be successfully commercialized, several hurdles have to be overcome regarding the production of cheap but effective antigens and adjuvants, while bearing in mind environmental and associated regulatory concerns (e.g., those that limit the use of live vaccines). Pharmaceutical companies have performed a considerable amount of research on fish vaccines, however, limited information is available in scientific publications. In addition, salmonids dominate both the literature and commercial focus, despite their relatively small contribution to the total volume of farmed fish in the world. This review provides an overview of the fish vaccines that are currently commercially available and some viewpoints on how the field is likely to evolve in the near future."
vaccines,"Because of the large preexisting antigenic load and immunosuppressive environment within a tumor, inducing therapeutically useful antitumor immunity in cancer patients requires the development of powerful vaccination protocols. An approach gaining increasing popularity in the tumor vaccine field is to immunize cancer patients with their own DCs loaded ex vivo with tumor antigens. The underlying premise of this approach is that the efficiency and control over the vaccination process provided by ex vivo manipulation of the DCs generates an optimally potent APC and a superior method for stimulating antitumor immunity in vivo compared with the more conventional direct vaccination methods, offsetting the added cost and complexity associated with this form of customized cell therapy."
vaccines,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite that can infect a wide range of animals including humans. This single known species in the genus Toxoplasma is considered as one of the most successful eukaryotic pathogens which is of major medical and veterinary importance. Effective vaccines may contribute toward preventing and controlling the spread of toxoplasmosis. The present communication addresses the current status of development of vaccines against T. gondii. Further discussion is made on the difficulties along with challenges, such as vaccine construct, mode of vaccine administration and standardization of immunization evaluation. Finally suggestions are made on possible directions for future research on the development of vaccines against T. gondii."
vaccines,"The aim of this review is to make researchers aware of the benefits of an efficient quality control system for prediction of a developed vaccine’s efficacy. Two major goals should be addressed when inactivating a virus for vaccine purposes: first, the infectious virus should be inactivated completely in order to be safe, and second, the viral epitopes important for the induction of protective immunity should be conserved after inactivation in order to have an antigen of high quality. Therefore, some problems associated with the virus inactivation process, such as virus aggregate formation, protein crosslinking, protein denaturation and degradation should be addressed before testing an inactivated vaccine in vivo."
vaccines,"Influenza vaccine preparations have been administered to humans since the late 1930s,1 and the diversity of approaches in licensed trivalent seasonal or monovalent pandemic products is unparalleled by vaccines against any other target. These approaches include inactivated whole virus vaccines, detergent or solvent “split” vaccines, subunit vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines, intramuscular vaccines, intradermal vaccines, intranasal vaccines, egg-produced vaccines and mammalian cell culture-produced vaccines. The challenges of influenza immunization, including multiple co-circulating strains, antigenic change over time, a broad age spectrum of disease, and the threat of pandemics, continue to drive the development of new approaches. This review describes some of the new approaches to influenza immunization that are the subjects of active research and development."
vaccines,"Summary The concept of using plants to produce high‐value pharmaceuticals such as vaccines is 20 years old this year and is only now on the brink of realisation as an established technology. The original reliance on transgenic plants has largely given way to transient expression; proofs of concept for human and animal vaccines and of efficacy for animal vaccines have been established; several plant‐produced vaccines have been through Phase I clinical trials in humans and more are scheduled; regulatory requirements are more clear than ever, and more facilities exist for manufacture of clinic‐grade materials. The original concept of cheap edible vaccines has given way to a realisation that formulated products are required, which may well be injectable. The technology has proven its worth as a means of cheap, easily scalable production of materials: it now needs to find its niche in competition with established technologies. The realised achievements in the field as well as promising new developments will be reviewed, such as rapid‐response vaccines for emerging viruses with pandemic potential and bioterror agents."
vaccines,"This observer-blind study compared the prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Cervarix™ (GlaxoSmithKline) and Gardasil® (Merck), by assessing immunogenicity and safety through one month after completion of the three-dose vaccination course. Women (n=1106) were stratified by age (18–26, 27–35, 36–45 years) and randomized (1:1) to receive Cervarix™ (Months 0, 1, 6) or Gardasil® (Months 0, 2, 6). At Month 7 after first vaccination, all women in the according-to-protocol cohort who were seronegative/DNA negative before vaccination for the HPV type analyzed had seroconverted for HPV-16 and HPV-18 serum neutralizing antibodies, as measured by pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA), except for two women aged 27–35 years in the Gardasil® group who did not seroconvert for HPV-18 (98%). Geometric mean titers of serum neutralizing antibodies ranged from 2.3–4.8-fold higher for HPV-16 and 6.8–9.1-fold higher for HPV-18 after vaccination with Cervarix™ compared with Gardasil®, across all age strata. In the total vaccinated cohort (all women who received at least one vaccine dose, regardless of their serological and DNA status prior to vaccination), Cervarix™ induced significantly higher serum neutralizing antibody titers in all age strata (p"
vaccines,"Summary:  Understanding the mechanisms underlying the induction of immunity in the gastrointestinal mucosa following oral immunization and the cross‐talk between mucosal and systemic immunity should expedite the development of vaccines to diminish the global burden caused by enteric pathogens. Identifying an immunological correlate of protection in the course of field trials of efficacy, animal models (when available), or human challenge studies is also invaluable. In industrialized country populations, live attenuated vaccines (e.g. polio, typhoid, and rotavirus) mimic natural infection and generate robust protective immune responses. In contrast, a major challenge is to understand and overcome the barriers responsible for the diminished immunogenicity and efficacy of the same enteric vaccines in underprivileged populations in developing countries. Success in developing vaccines against some enteric pathogens has heretofore been elusive (e.g. Shigella). Different types of oral vaccines can selectively or inclusively elicit mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A and serum immunoglobulin G antibodies and a variety of cell‐mediated immune responses. Areas of research that require acceleration include interaction between the gut innate immune system and the stimulation of adaptive immunity, development of safe yet effective mucosal adjuvants, better understanding of homing to the mucosa of immunologically relevant cells, and elicitation of mucosal immunologic memory. This review dissects the immune responses elicited in humans by enteric vaccines."

Use of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine---recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], 2009. MMWR 2009;58:[No. RR-10]). The 2010 influenza recommendations include new and updated information. Highlights of the 2010 recommendations include 1) a recommendation that annual vaccination be administered to all persons aged >or=6 months for the 2010-11 influenza season; 2) a recommendation that children aged 6 months--8 years whose vaccination status is unknown or who have never received seasonal influenza vaccine before (or who received seasonal vaccine for the first time in 2009-10 but received only 1 dose in their first year of vaccination) as well as children who did not receive at least 1 dose of an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine regardless of previous influenza vaccine history should receive 2 doses of a 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccine (minimum interval: 4 weeks) during the 2010--11 season; 3) a recommendation that vaccines containing the 2010-11 trivalent vaccine virus strains A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like (the same strain as was used for 2009 H1N1 monovalent vaccines), A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens be used; 4) information about Fluzone High-Dose, a newly approved vaccine for persons aged >or=65 years; and 5) information about other standard-dose newly approved influenza vaccines and previously approved vaccines with expanded age indications. Vaccination efforts should begin as soon as the 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccine is available and continue through the influenza season. These recommendations also include a summary of safety data for U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines. These recommendations and other information are available at CDC's influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu); any updates or supplements that might be required during the 2010-11 influenza season also will be available at this website. Recommendations for influenza diagnosis and antiviral use will be published before the start of the 2010-11 influenza season. Vaccination and health-care providers should be alert to announcements of recommendation updates and should check the CDC influenza website periodically for additional information."
vaccines,"Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a significant human health concern in Asia, Indonesia and parts of Australia with more than 3 billion people potentially at risk of infection with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), the causative agent of JE. Given the risk to human health and the theoretical potential for JEV use as a bioweapon, the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent JEV infection is vital for preserving human health. The development of vaccines for JE began in the 1940s with formalin-inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines. These vaccines have been shown to induce a protective immune response and to be very effective. Mouse brain-derived vaccines were still in use until May 2011 when the last lots of the BIKEN(®) JE-VAX(®) expired. Development of modern JE vaccines utilizes cell culture-derived viruses and improvements in manufacturing processes as well as removal of potential allergens or toxins have significantly improved vaccine safety. China has developed a live-attenuated vaccine that has proven to induce protective immunity following a single inoculation. In addition, a chimeric vaccine virus incorporating the prM and E structural proteins derived from the live-attenuated JE vaccine into the live-attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine virus backbone is currently in clinical trials. In this article, we provide a summary of JE vaccine development and on-going clinical trials. We also discuss the potential risk of JEV as a bioweapon with a focus on virus sustainability if used as a weapon."
vaccines,"Summary:  The eradication of smallpox, one of the great triumphs of medicine, was accomplished through the prophylactic administration of live vaccinia virus, a comparatively benign relative of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. Nevertheless, recent fears that variola virus may be used as a biological weapon together with the present susceptibility of unimmunized populations have spurred the development of new‐generation vaccines that are safer than the original and can be produced by modern methods. Predicting the efficacy of such vaccines in the absence of human smallpox, however, depends on understanding the correlates of protection. This review outlines the biology of poxviruses with particular relevance to vaccine development, describes protein targets of humoral and cellular immunity, compares animal models of orthopoxvirus disease with human smallpox, and considers the status of second‐ and third‐generation smallpox vaccines."
vaccines,"Introduction: Glycoconjugate vaccines are among the safest and most efficacious vaccines developed during the last 30 years. They are a potent tool for prevention of life-threatening bacterial infectious diseases like meningitis and pneumonia. The concept of hapten–carrier conjugation is now being extended to other disease areas. Areas covered: This is an overview of the history and current status of glycoconjugate vaccines. The authors discuss the approaches for their preparation and quality control as well as those variables which might affect their product profile. The authors also look at the potential to develop fully synthetic conjugate vaccines based on the progress of organic chemistry. Additionally, new applications of conjugate vaccines technology in the field of non-infectious diseases are discussed. Through this review, the reader will have an insight regarding the issues and complexities involved in the preparation and characterization of conjugate vaccines, the variables that might affect their immunogenicity and the potential for future applications. Expert opinion: The immunogenicity of weak T-independent antigens can be increased in quantity and quality by conjugation to protein carriers, which provide T-cell help. Glycoconjugate vaccines are among the safest and most efficacious vaccines developed so far. Various conjugation procedures and carrier proteins can be used. Many variables impact on the immunogenicity of conjugate vaccines and a tight control through physicochemical tests is important to ensure manufacturing and clinical consistency. New and challenging targets for conjugate vaccines are represented by cancer and other non-infectious diseases."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
In 1999, meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccines were introduced in the United Kingdom for those under 19 years of age. The impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred.


METHODS
Multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping.


RESULTS
A reduction in serogroup C carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. Vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (ST)-11 complex serogroup C meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression.


CONCLUSIONS
The impact of vaccination with MCC vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group C meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. The high impact on the carriage of ST-11 complex serogroup C could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. High vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND. The high visibility of controversies regarding vaccination makes it increasingly important to understand how parents decide whether to vaccinate their infants. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this research was to investigate decision-making about vaccinations for infants. DESIGN. We conducted qualitative, open-ended interviews. PARTICIPANTS. Subjects included mothers 1 to 3 days postpartum and again at 3 to 6 months. RESULTS. We addressed 3 topics: attitudes to vaccination, knowledge about vaccination, and decision-making. Mothers who intended to have their infants vaccinated (“vaccinators,” n = 25) either agreed with or did not question vaccination or they accepted vaccination but had significant concerns. Mothers who did not intend to vaccinate (“nonvaccinators,” n = 8) either completely rejected vaccination or they purposely delayed vaccinating/chose only some vaccines. Knowledge about which vaccines are recommended for children was poor among both vaccinators and nonvaccinators. The theme of trust in the medical profession was the central concept that underpinned all of the themes about decision-making. Promoters of vaccination included trusting the pediatrician, feeling satisfied by the pediatrician’s discussion about vaccines, not wanting to diverge from the cultural norm, and wanting to adhere to the social contact. Inhibitors included feeling alienated by or unable to trust the pediatrician, having a trusting relationship with an influential homeopath/naturopath or other person who did not believe in vaccinating, worry about permanent side effects, beliefs that vaccine-preventable diseases are not serious, and feeling that since other children are vaccinated their child is not at risk. CONCLUSION. Trust or lack of trust and a relationship with a pediatrician or another influential person were pivotal for decision-making of new mothers about vaccinating their children. Attempts to work with mothers who are concerned about vaccinating their infants should focus not only on providing facts about vaccines but also on developing trusting and positive relationships."
vaccines,"SUMMARY Schistosomiasis, caused by trematode blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, is recognized as the most important human helminth infection in terms of morbidity and mortality. Infection follows direct contact with freshwater harboring free-swimming larval (cercaria) forms of the parasite. Despite the existence of the highly effective antischistosome drug praziquantel (PZQ), schistosomiasis is spreading into new areas, and although it is the cornerstone of current control programs, PZQ chemotherapy does have limitations. In particular, mass treatment does not prevent reinfection. Furthermore, there is increasing concern about the development of parasite resistance to PZQ. Consequently, vaccine strategies represent an essential component for the future control of schistosomiasis as an adjunct to chemotherapy. An improved understanding of the immune response to schistosome infection, both in animal models and in humans, suggests that development of a vaccine may be possible. This review considers aspects of antischistosome protective immunity that are important in the context of vaccine development. The current status in the development of vaccines against the African (Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium) and Asian (S. japonicum) schistosomes is then discussed, as are new approaches that may improve the efficacy of available vaccines and aid in the identification of new targets for immune attack."
vaccines,"SUMMARY The major goals of veterinary vaccines are to improve the health and welfare of companion animals, increase production of livestock in a cost-effective manner, and prevent animal-to-human transmission from both domestic animals and wildlife. These diverse aims have led to different approaches to the development of veterinary vaccines from crude but effective whole-pathogen preparations to molecularly defined subunit vaccines, genetically engineered organisms or chimeras, vectored antigen formulations, and naked DNA injections. The final successful outcome of vaccine research and development is the generation of a product that will be available in the marketplace or that will be used in the field to achieve desired outcomes. As detailed in this review, successful veterinary vaccines have been produced against viral, bacterial, protozoal, and multicellular pathogens, which in many ways have led the field in the application and adaptation of novel technologies. These veterinary vaccines have had, and continue to have, a major impact not only on animal health and production but also on human health through increasing safe food supplies and preventing animal-to-human transmission of infectious diseases. The continued interaction between animals and human researchers and health professionals will be of major importance for adapting new technologies, providing animal models of disease, and confronting new and emerging infectious diseases."
vaccines,"The need for potentiating immune responses to recombinant or subunit antigens has prompted GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals to develop various Adjuvant Systems for the design of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Adjuvant Systems are formulations of classical adjuvants mixed with immunomodulators, specifically adapted to the antigen and the target population. They can activate the appropriate innate immune system and subsequently impact on adaptive immune responses. AS04 is an Adjuvant System that has demonstrated significant achievements in several vaccines against viral diseases. AS02, another Adjuvant System, is being evaluated in various contexts, where a strong T-cell response is needed to afford protection. Likewise, AS01 has been developed for vaccines where the induction of a yet stronger T-cell-mediated immune response is required. Altogether, the promising clinical results strongly support the concept of Adjuvant Systems and allow for further development of new vaccines, best adapted to the target population and the immune mechanisms of protection."
vaccines,"Although child vaccination rates remain high, some parental concern persists that vaccines might cause autism. Three specific hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. We will discuss the genesis of each of these theories and review the relevant epidemiological evidence."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Concern about both safety and efficacy has made the use of whole-cell pertussis vaccines controversial. In some European countries, including Italy, the rate of vaccination against pertussis is low.


METHODS
We conducted a double-blind trial in Italy in which infants were randomly assigned to vaccination at two, four, and six months of age with an acellular pertussis vaccine together with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DTP); a DTP vaccine containing whole-cell pertussis (manufactured by Connaught Laboratories); or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids without pertussis (DT). The acellular DTP vaccine was either one containing filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and pertussis toxin inactivated with formalin and glutaraldehyde (SmithKline Beecham) or one with filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and genetically detoxified pertussis toxin (Chiron Biocine). Pertussis was defined as 21 days or more of paroxysmal cough, with infection confirmed by culture or serologic testing.


RESULTS
The efficacy of each vaccine, given in three doses, against pertussis was determined for 14,751 children over an average of 17 months, with cases included in the analysis if cough began 30 days or more after the completion of immunization. For both of the acellular DTP vaccines, the efficacy was 84 percent (95 percent confidence intervals, 76 to 89 percent for Biocine DTP and 76 to 90 percent for SmithKline DTP), whereas the efficacy of the whole-cell DTP vaccine was only 36 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 52 percent). The antibody responses were greater to the acellular vaccines than to the whole-cell vaccine. Local and systemic adverse events were significantly more frequent after the administration of the whole-cell vaccine. For the acellular vaccines, the frequency of adverse events was similar to that in the control (DT) group.


CONCLUSIONS
The two acellular DTP vaccines we studied were safe, immunogenic, and efficacious against pertussis, whereas the efficacy of the whole-cell DTP vaccine was unexpectedly low."
vaccines,"Hyporesponsiveness (immune tolerance) follows vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide and many pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes. Hyporesponsiveness after Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccination has not been directly observed, but may follow exposure during disease in some individuals. Use of currently licensed conjugate vaccines has not been associated with hyporesponsiveness to date, with the possible exception of pneumococcal serotype 3. Introduction of polysaccharide vaccines anywhere into a conjugate vaccination schedule may result in reduced immune responses on subsequent exposure. This review of vaccine-induced hyporesponsiveness and its potential clinical implications considers recent evidence suggesting that hyporesponsiveness may occur for specific components of combined conjugate vaccines, such as pneumococcal serotype 3. These data have implications for the development of new multivalent vaccines."
vaccines,"Tumor vaccines have shown promise in early clinical trials. Among them, tumor cells genetically engineered to secrete biologically active granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can generate a systemic antitumor immune response. Although the minimal required GM-CSF dose produced by modified tumor cells to achieve a measurable antitumor effect is well known, no data examined whether an upper therapeutic limit may exist for this vaccination strategy. Because recent data demonstrate an immunosuppressive effect of GM-CSF produced by growing tumors, we thus sought to determine whether high GM-CSF doses administered in a vaccine formulation could impair antitumor immunity. Using a vaccine strategy involving a GM-CSF-producing bystander cell line (B78H1-GM) admixed with autologous tumor, we assessed the impact of varying doses of GM-CSF while maintaining a constant antigen dose. Our results defined a threshold above which a GM-CSF-based vaccine not only lost its efficacy, but more importantly for its clinical implications resulted in substantial immunosuppression in vivo. Above this threshold, GM-CSF induced Gr1+/CD11b+ myeloid suppressor cells that substantially impaired antigen-specific T-cell responses and adversely affected antitumor immune responses in vivo. The dual effects of GM-CSF are mediated by the systemic and not local concentration of this cytokine. Myeloid suppressor cell-induced immunosuppression is mediated by nitric oxide production via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) because the specific iNOS inhibitor, l-NMMA, restored antigen-specific T-cell responsiveness in vitro. Taken together, our data demonstrated the negative impact of supra-therapeutic vaccine doses of GM-CSF and underscored the importance of identifying these critical variables in an effort to increase the therapeutic efficacy of tumor vaccines."
vaccines,"Abstract Virus-like particles are supra-molecular assemblages, usually icosahedral or rod-like structures. They incorporate key immunologic features of viruses which include repetitive surfaces, particulate structures and induction of innate immunity through activation of pathogen-associated molecular-pattern recognition receptors. They carry no replicative genetic information and can be produced recombinantly in large scale. Virus-like particles thus represent a safe and effective vaccine platform for inducing potent B- and T-cell responses. In addition to being effective vaccines against the corresponding virus from which they are derived, virus-like particles can also be used to present foreign epitopes to the immune system. This can be achieved by genetic fusion or chemical conjugation. This technological innovation has greatly broadened the scope of their use, from immunizing against microbial pathogens to immunotherapy for chronic diseases. Towards this end, virus-like particles have been used to induce autoantibodies to disease-associated self-molecules involved in chronic diseases, such as hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. The recognition of the potent immunogenicity and commercial potential for virus-like particles has greatly accelerated research and development activities. During the last decade, two prophylactic virus-like particle vaccines have been registered for human use, while another 12 vaccines entered clinical development."
vaccines,"Abstract Background A rapid increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases due to the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in highly vaccinated populations has aroused concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines. Methods We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron and delta (B.1.617.2) variants in England. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated after primary immunization with two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and after a booster dose of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or mRNA-1273. Results Between November 27, 2021, and January 12, 2022, a total of 886,774 eligible persons infected with the omicron variant, 204,154 eligible persons infected with the delta variant, and 1,572,621 eligible test-negative controls were identified. At all time points investigated and for all combinations of primary course and booster vaccines, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was higher for the delta variant than for the omicron variant. No effect against the omicron variant was noted from 20 weeks after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 doses, whereas vaccine effectiveness after two BNT162b2 doses was 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.9 to 67.0) at 2 to 4 weeks, dropping to 8.8% (95% CI, 7.0 to 10.5) at 25 or more weeks. Among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 62.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 63.0) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before decreasing to 39.6% (95% CI, 38.0 to 41.1) at 10 or more weeks. Among BNT162b2 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 67.2% (95% CI, 66.5 to 67.8) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before declining to 45.7% (95% CI, 44.7 to 46.7) at 10 or more weeks. Vaccine effectiveness after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course increased to 70.1% (95% CI, 69.5 to 70.7) at 2 to 4 weeks after an mRNA-1273 booster and decreased to 60.9% (95% CI, 59.7 to 62.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. After a BNT162b2 primary course, the mRNA-1273 booster increased vaccine effectiveness to 73.9% (95% CI, 73.1 to 74.6) at 2 to 4 weeks; vaccine effectiveness fell to 64.4% (95% CI, 62.6 to 66.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. Conclusions Primary immunization with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. A BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster after either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 primary course substantially increased protection, but that protection waned over time.

vaccines,"In 1900, for every 1,000 babies born in the United States, 100 would die before their first birthday, often due to infectious diseases. Today, vaccines exist for many viral and bacterial diseases. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, passed in 1986, was intended to bolster vaccine research and development through the federal coordination of vaccine initiatives and to provide relief to vaccine manufacturers facing financial burdens. The legislation also intended to address concerns about the safety of vaccines by instituting a compensation program, setting up a passive surveillance system for vaccine adverse events, and by providing information to consumers. A key component of the legislation required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to assess concerns about the safety of vaccines and potential adverse events, especially in children. Adverse Effects of Vaccines reviews the epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence regarding adverse health events associated with specific vaccines covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), including the varicella zoster vaccine, influenza vaccines, the hepatitis B vaccine, and the human papillomavirus vaccine, among others. For each possible adverse event, the report reviews peer-reviewed primary studies, summarizes their findings, and evaluates the epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence. It finds that while no vaccine is 100 percent safe, very few adverse events are shown to be caused by vaccines. In addition, the evidence shows that vaccines do not cause several conditions. For example, the MMR vaccine is not associated with autism or childhood diabetes. Also, the DTaP vaccine is not associated with diabetes and the influenza vaccine given as a shot does not exacerbate asthma. Adverse Effects of Vaccines will be of special interest to the National Vaccine Program Office, the VICP, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccine safety researchers and manufacturers, parents, caregivers, and health professionals in the private and public sectors."
vaccines,"OBJECTIVES. Prophylactic vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are expected to be available for public use by 2007 and likely will be targeted to preadolescent children. Parental acceptance of these vaccines will be critical for their success. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the overall acceptance of HPV vaccines for preadolescent children by parents, (2) to evaluate the influence of written educational information about HPV on parental acceptability of HPV vaccines, and (3) to identify independent predictors associated with HPV vaccine acceptability by parents. METHODS. A randomized intervention study within a cross-sectional survey was conducted. Parental HPV vaccine acceptability was measured under 3 different hypothetical scenarios. A self-administered survey on the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about HPV and HPV vaccines was sent to 1600 parents of 8- to 12-year-old children. In addition to a baseline paragraph about HPV that was received by all study participants, a random half of the study participants received a detailed “HPV Information Sheet” outlining the epidemiology and potential clinical sequelae of HPV infection. Independent predictors of parental HPV vaccine acceptability were determined using multivariate linear regression models. RESULTS. Parents who received the HPV information sheet had higher mean scores on the HPV knowledge assessment tool than the control group. However, despite this apparent improvement in knowledge, there was not a statistically significant difference in HPV vaccine acceptability between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS. Providing parents with an HPV information sheet did seem to improve knowledge about HPV, but this increased knowledge had little effect on the acceptability of these vaccines by parents for their children. Instead, attitudes and life experiences seemed to be more important factors influencing HPV vaccine acceptability among parents."
vaccines,"Two vaccines against HPV are commercially available: an HPV-16/18 (bivalent) and an HPV-6/11/16/18 (quadrivalent) vaccine. Vaccination programs have been and will be implemented before the full duration of protection is known. Whether booster doses will be required is also unknown at this time. Meanwhile, predictions rely upon phase III studies and mathematical modelling. In a head to head study, the bivalent vaccine induced a higher, more sustained immune response than the quadrivalent vaccine. Immunogenicity of the bivalent vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18 has been demonstrated up to 8.4 years. For the quadrivalent vaccine, immunogenicity data up to 5 years show that the immune response against HPV-18 wanes after approximately 4 years. Efficacy against infection and cervical lesions associated with HPV-16/18 has been shown up to 8.4 and 5 years with the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccine, respectively. Cross-protection against non-vaccine types appears stronger with the bivalent vaccine. However, both vaccines may provide sufficient immunogenicity to confer long-term protection. Ongoing monitoring is essential."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The efficacy of influenza vaccines may vary from year to year, depending on a variety of factors, and may differ for inactivated and live attenuated vaccines.


METHODS
We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of licensed inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines in healthy adults during the 2007-2008 influenza season and estimated the absolute and relative efficacies of the two vaccines.


RESULTS
A total of 1952 subjects were enrolled and received study vaccines in the fall of 2007. Influenza activity occurred from January through April 2008, with the circulation of influenza types A (H3N2) (about 90%) and B (about 9%). Absolute efficacy against both types of influenza, as measured by isolating the virus in culture, identifying it on real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay, or both, was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46 to 81) for the inactivated vaccine and 36% (95% CI, 0 to 59) for the live attenuated vaccine. In terms of relative efficacy, there was a 50% (95% CI, 20 to 69) reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza among subjects who received inactivated vaccine as compared with those given live attenuated vaccine. The absolute efficacy against the influenza A virus was 72% (95% CI, 49 to 84) for the inactivated vaccine and 29% (95% CI, -14 to 55) for the live attenuated vaccine, with a relative efficacy of 60% (95% CI, 33 to 77) for the inactivated vaccine.


CONCLUSIONS
In the 2007-2008 season, the inactivated vaccine was efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza A (predominately H3N2) in healthy adults. The live attenuated vaccine also prevented influenza illnesses but was less efficacious. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00538512.)"
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The rate of nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements has been increasing, and children with exemptions have contributed to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.


OBJECTIVES
To determine why parents claim nonmedical exemptions and to explore differences in perceptions of vaccines and vaccine information sources between parents of exempt and fully vaccinated children.


DESIGN
Case-control study.


SETTING
Colorado, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Washington.


PARTICIPANTS
Surveys were mailed to the parents of 815 exempt children (cases) and 1630 fully vaccinated children (controls randomly selected from the same grade and school) recruited from 112 private and public elementary schools. Surveys were completed by 2435 parents (56.1%).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Parental reports.


RESULTS
Most children (209 [75.5%] of 277) with nonmedical exemptions received at least some vaccines. The most common vaccine not received was varicella (147 [53.1%] of 277 exempt children). The most common reason stated for requesting exemptions (190 [69%] of 277) was concern that the vaccines might cause harm. Parents of exempt children were significantly more likely than parents of vaccinated children to report low perceived vaccine safety and efficacy, a low level of trust in the government, and low perceived susceptibility to and severity of vaccine-preventable diseases. Parents of exempt children were significantly less likely to report confidence in medical, public health, and government sources for vaccine information and were more likely to report confidence in alternative medicine professionals than parents of vaccinated children.


CONCLUSION
Continued efforts must be made to educate parents about the utility and safety of vaccines, especially parents requesting nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements."
vaccines,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most economically and socially devastating diseases affecting animal agriculture throughout the world. Although mortality is usually low in adult animals, millions of animals have been killed in efforts to rapidly control and eradicate FMD. The causing virus, FMD virus (FMDV), is a highly variable RNA virus occurring in seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia 1, Sat 1, Sat 2 and Sat 3) and a large number of subtypes. FMDV is one of the most infectious agents known, affecting cloven-hoofed animals with significant variations in infectivity and virus transmission. Although inactivated FMD vaccines have been available for decades, there is little or no cross-protection across serotypes and subtypes, requiring vaccines that are matched to circulating field strains. Current inactivated vaccines require growth of virulent virus, posing a threat of escape from manufacturing sites, have limited shelf life and require re-vaccination every 4–12 months. These vaccines have aided in the eradication of FMD from Europe and the control of clinical disease in many parts of the world, albeit at a very high cost. However, FMDV persists in endemic regions impacting millions of people dependent on livestock for food and their livelihood. Usually associated with developing countries that lack the resources to control it, FMD is a global problem and the World Organization for Animal Health and the United Nations’ Food Agriculture Organization have called for its global control and eradication. One of the main limitations to FMDV eradication is the lack of vaccines designed for this purpose, vaccines that not only protect against clinical signs but that can actually prevent infection and effectively interrupt the natural transmission cycle. These vaccines should be safely and inexpensively produced, be easy to deliver, and also be capable of inducing lifelong immunity against multiple serotypes and subtypes. Furthermore, there is a need for better integrated strategies that fit the specific needs of endemic regions. Availability of these critical components will greatly enhance the chances for the global control and eradication of FMDV."
vaccines,"Effective prophylactic and/or therapeutic vaccination is a key strategy for controlling the global TB epidemic. The partial effectiveness of the existing TB vaccine, bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG), suggests effective vaccination is possible and highlights the need for an improved vaccination strategy. Clinical trials are evaluating both modifications to the existing BCG immunization methods and also novel TB vaccines, designed to replace or boost BCG. Candidate vaccines in clinical development include live mycobacterial vaccines designed to replace BCG, subunit vaccines designed to boost BCG and therapeutic vaccines designed as an adjunct to chemotherapy. There is a great need for validated animal models, identification of immunological biomarkers of protection and field sites with the capacity for large-scale efficacy testing in order to develop and license a novel TB vaccine or regimen."
vaccines,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus maintained in a zoonotic cycle and transmitted by the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus, causes epidemics of encephalitis throughout much of Asia. Resident populations, including short- or long-term visitors to enzootic regions, are at risk of infection and disease. For the past several decades, killed viral vaccines prepared in tissue culture or mouse brain have been used effectively to immunize travelers and residents of enzootic countries. Cost, efficacy and safety concerns led to the development of a live-attenuated virus vaccine (SA14-14-2) and more recently, to the licensure in the USA, Europe, Canada, and Australia of a purified inactivated, tissue culture-based Japanese encephalitis vaccine (IXIARO®, referred to as IC51; Intercell AG, Vienna, Austria). In addition, a live-attenuated yellow fever–Japanese encephalitis chimeric vaccine (IMOJEV™, referred to as Japanese encephalitis-CV; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) was recently licensed in Australia and is under review in Thailand. A broad portfolio of safe and effective Japanese encephalitis vaccines has become available to meet the needs of at-risk populations; when appropriately delivered, these new vaccines should greatly diminish the burden of disease."
vaccines,"Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

vaccines,"Aluminium adjuvants are the most widely used adjuvants in both human and veterinary vaccines. These adjuvants have been used in practical vaccination for more than 60 years and are generally recognized as safe and as stimulators of Th2 immunity. The present review gives a short introduction to the pioneering research at the start of the use of aluminium compounds as adjuvants, including references on the chemistry of these compounds. Analytical methods for identifying the most commonly used aluminium compounds, such as boehmite and aluminium hydroxyphosphate, are mentioned. Emphasis is placed on the important factors for antigen adsorption and on the latest work using gene‐deficient mice in the research of the mechanism of aluminium adjuvants in terms of cytokine and T‐cell subset stimulation. Key references on the ability of aluminium adjuvants to stimulate IgE and also in vivo clearing of aluminium adjuvants are discussed. Furthermore, the review addresses the issue of local reactions in the context of injection route and local tissue disturbance. Possible new applications of aluminium adjuvants in, for example, combined aluminium‐adsorbed protein and DNA oligonucleotide vaccines as well as the possible use of aluminium adjuvants in combination with IL‐12 to stimulate Th1‐type immune responses are mentioned."
vaccines,"Influenza virus is a globally important respiratory pathogen which causes a high degree of morbidity and mortality annually. The virus is continuously undergoing antigenic change and thus bypasses the host's acquired immunity to influenza. Despite the improvement in antiviral therapy during the last decade, vaccination is still the most effective method of prophylaxis. Vaccination induces a good degree of protection (60–90% efficacy) and is well tolerated by the recipient. For those at risk of complications from influenza, annual vaccination is recommended due to the antigenic changes in circulating strains. However, there is still room for improvement in vaccine efficacy, long‐lasting effect, ease of administration and compliance rates. The mucosal tissues of the respiratory tract are the main portal entry of influenza, and the mucosal immune system provides the first line of defence against infection. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and IgM are the major neutralizing antibodies directed against mucosal pathogens. These antibodies work to prevent pathogen entry and can function intracellularly to inhibit replication of virus. This review describes influenza virus infection, epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune system response, particularly as it pertains to mucosal immunity and vaccine use. Specifically, this review provides an update of the current status on influenza vaccination and concentrates on the two main types of influenza vaccines currently in use, namely the cold‐adapted vaccine (CAV) given intranasally/orally, and the inactivated vaccine (IV) delivered subcutanously or intramuscularly. The commercially available trivalent IV (TIV) elicits good serum antibody responses but induces poorly mucosal IgA antibody and cell‐mediated immunity. In contrast, the CAV may elicit a long‐lasting, broader immune (humoral and cellular) response, which more closely resembles natural immunity. The immune response induced by these two vaccines will be compared in this review."
vaccines,"Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), an acute disease caused by Junin virus (JUNV, Arenaviridae), has been an important issue to public health in Argentina since the early 1950s. The field rodent Calomys musculinus is JUNV natural reservoir and human disease is a consequence of contact with infected rodents. A steady extention of AHF endemic area is being observed since the first reports of the disease. Important achievements have been made in: (a) improvement of methods for the etiological diagnosis; (b) implementation and validation of therapeutical measures; (c) development of vaccines to protect against AHF. Reference is made to different research strategies used to obtain anti-AHF vaccines in the past and anti-arenaviral diseases in the present. Information is updated on features and field performance of Candid #1 vaccine, a live attenuted vaccine currently used to prevent AHF. This vaccine was developed through a joint international effort that envisioned it as an orphan drug. With transferred technology, Argentine government was committed to be Candid #1 manufacturer and to register this vaccine as a novel medical product under the Argentine regulatory authority. Candid #1 vaccine is the first one used to control an arenaviral hemorrhagic fever, the first live viral vaccine to be manufactured and registered in Argentina, reaching its target population through governmental effort."
vaccines,"Abstract Background Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. Conclusions The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

vaccines,"The World Health Organization estimates that rotavirus diarrhea results in approximately half a million deaths and approximately 2.4 million hospitalizations in developing countries each year. Two live oral rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq© (RV5; Merck) and Rotarix© (RV1; GlaxoSmithKline) with good efficacy against severe rotavirus disease and a reassuring safety profile could substantially impact the burden of rotavirus disease. In April 2009, WHO provided a recommendation for global introduction of these vaccines in national immunization programs of developing countries worldwide. In this article, we review published data on previous candidate rotavirus vaccines and vaccines in current use, with emphasis on their performance in developed versus developing countries. In developed countries, both first and second generation rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy against severe rotavirus disease (pooled efficacy = 73% and 85%, respectively). In developing countries, small early trials for the first generation vaccines failed to provide protection against rotavirus disease (pooled efficacy = 20%), however, trials of the second generation vaccines yielded substantial improvements in efficacy in developing countries (pooled efficacy of 51%), leading to a global recommendation for rotavirus vaccine introduction by WHO. Future efforts for these vaccines should focus on optimizing the efficacy and delivery of these vaccines in challenging target populations of Asia and Africa with the greatest burden of severe rotavirus disease."
vaccines,"The difficulty of inducing protective immunity through antibodies against sporozoites led to efforts to assess vectored vaccines as a means of inducing protective T cell immunity against the malaria liver-stage parasite. Although DNA vectored vaccines used alone were poorly immunogenic and not protective, high levels of parasite clearance in the liver has been achieved with viral vectored vaccines used in heterologous prime-boost regimes. Such vectored vaccination regimes represent one of only two approaches that have induced repeatable partial efficacy in human P. falciparum subunit vaccine trials. Interestingly, vectors expressing the TRAP antigen have been consistently been more immunogenic and protective than vectors expressing the circumsporozoite protein in human trials. However, sterile protection requires induction of very potent T cell responses that are currently only achievable with heterologous prime-boost regimes. Recently, simian adenoviruses have been assessed as priming agents in Adenovirus-MVA regimes in both phase I and phase IIa trials in the UK, based on very promising pre-clinical results showing better immunogenicity and efficacy than previous prime-boost regimes. The same vectors are also being assessed clinically expressing blood-stage antigens, attempting to induce both protective antibodies and T cells as recently demonstrated in murine efficacy studies. These viral vectors now provide a major option for inclusion in a high efficacy multi-stage malaria vaccine that should achieve deployable levels of efficacy in endemic settings."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Vaccines represent a strategic successful tool used to prevent or contain diseases with high morbidity and/or mortality. However, while vaccines have proven to be effective in combating pathogenic microorganisms, based on the immune recognition of these foreign antigens, vaccines aimed at inducing effective antitumor activity are still unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the two licensed cancer-preventive vaccines targeting tumor-associated viral agents (anti-HBV [hepatitis B virus], to prevent HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, and anti-HPV [human papillomavirus], to prevent HPV-associated cervical carcinoma), along with the recent FDA approval of sipuleucel-T (for the therapeutic treatment of prostate cancer), represents a significant advancement in the field of cancer vaccines and a boost for new studies in the field. Specific active immunotherapies based on anticancer vaccines represent, indeed, a field in continuous evolution and expansion. Significant improvements may result from the selection of the appropriate tumor-specific target antigen (to overcome the peripheral immune tolerance) and/or the development of immunization strategies effective at inducing a protective immune response. This review aims to describe the vast spectrum of tumor antigens and strategies to develop cancer vaccines."
vaccines,"No broadly effective vaccines are available for prevention of group B meningococcal disease, which accounts for >50% of all cases. The group B capsule is an autoantigen and is not a suitable vaccine target. Outer-membrane vesicle vaccines appear to be safe and effective, but serum bactericidal responses in infants are specific for a porin protein, PorA, which is antigenically variable. To broaden protection, outer-membrane vesicle vaccines have been prepared from >1 strain, from mutants with >1 PorA, or from mutants with genetically detoxified endotoxin and overexpressed desirable antigens, such as factor H binding protein. Also, recombinant protein vaccines such as factor H binding protein, given alone or in combination with other antigens, are in late-stage clinical development and may be effective against the majority of group B strains. Thus, the prospects have never been better for developing vaccines for prevention of meningococcal disease, including that caused by group B strains."
vaccines,"Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major health problem for immune-compromised patients and individuals with cystic fibrosis. A vaccine against P. aeruginosa has long been sought after, but is so far not available. Several vaccine candidates have been assessed in experimental animals and humans, which include sub-cellular fractions, capsule components, purified and recombinant proteins. Unique characteristics of the host and the pathogen have complicated the vaccine development. This review summarizes the current state of vaccine development for this ubiquitous pathogen, in particular to provide mucosal immunity against infections of the respiratory tract in susceptible individuals with cystic fibrosis."
vaccines,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes virtually all cases of cervical cancer, the second most common cause of death from cancer among women worldwide. This Review examines prophylactic HPV subunit vaccines based on the ability of the viral L1 capsid protein to form virus-like particles (VLPs) that induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Following preclinical research by laboratories in the nonprofit sector, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline are developing commercial versions of the vaccine. Both vaccines target HPV16 and HPV18, which account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer. The Merck vaccine also targets HPV6 and HPV11, which account for approximately 90% of external genital warts. The vaccines have an excellent safety profile, are highly immunogenic, and have conferred complete type-specific protection against persistent infection and associated lesions in fully vaccinated women. Unresolved issues include the most critical groups to vaccinate and when the vaccine's cost may be low enough for widespread implementation in the developing world, where 80% of cervical cancer occurs."
vaccines,"We previously showed that bacterial DNA contains immunostimulatory motifs consisting of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides flanked by two 5' purines and two 3' pyrimidines. These motifs rapidly trigger an innate immune response, characterized by the production of IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-gamma. Since DNA vaccines are constructed from plasmids of bacterial DNA, we examined whether CpG motifs present in these plasmids contributed to the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. In vitro experiments showed that DNA plasmids induced production of the same cytokines stimulated by bacterial DNA, an effect eliminated by DNase treatment. In vivo experiments showed that the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine was significantly reduced by methylating its CpG motifs and was significantly increased by coadministering exogenous CpG-containing DNA. These findings support the conclusion that CpG motifs in the plasmid backbone of DNA vaccines play an important role in the induction of Ag-specific immunity."
vaccines,"Tumor-specific immune tolerance limits the effectiveness of cancer vaccines. In addition, tumor vaccines alone have a limited potential for the treatment of measurable tumor burdens. This highlights the importance of identifying more potent cancer vaccine strategies for clinical testing. We tested immune-modulating doses of chemotherapy in combination with a granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting, HER-2/neu (neu)-expressing whole-cell vaccine as a means to treat existing mammary tumors in antigen-specific tolerized neu transgenic mice. Earlier studies have shown that neu transgenic mice exhibit immune tolerance to the neu-expressing tumors similar to what is observed in patients with cancer. We found that cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin, when given in a defined sequence with a GM-CSF-secreting, neu-expressing whole-cell vaccine, enhanced the vaccine's potential to delay tumor growth in neu transgenic mice. In addition, we showed that these drugs mediate their effects by enhancing the efficacy of the vaccine rather than via a direct cytolytic effect on cancer cells. Furthermore, paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide appear to amplify the T helper 1 neu-specific T-cell response. These findings suggest that the combined treatment with immune-modulating doses of chemotherapy and the GM-CSF-secreting neu vaccine can overcome immune tolerance and induce an antigen-specific antitumor immune response. These data provide the immunological rationale for testing immune-modulating doses of chemotherapy in combination with tumor vaccines in patients with cancer."
vaccines,"The development of cell culture systems for virus propagation has led to major advances in virus vaccine development. Primary and diploid cell culture systems are now being replaced by the use of continuous cell lines (CCLs). These substrates are gaining increasing acceptance from regulatory authorities as improved screening technologies remove fears regarding their potential oncogenic properties. The Vero cell line is the most widely accepted CCL by regulatory authorities and has been used for over 30 years for the production of polio and rabies virus vaccines. The recent licensure of a Vero cell-derived live virus vaccine (ACAM2000, smallpox vaccine) has coincided with an explosion in the development of a range of new viral vaccines, ranging from live-attenuated pediatric vaccines against rotavirus infections to inactivated whole-virus vaccines against H5N1 pandemic influenza. These developments have illustrated the value of this cell culture platform in the rapid development of vaccines against a range of virus diseases."
vaccines,"Cervical cancer, the most common cancer affecting women in developing countries, is caused by persistent infection with ""high-risk"" genotypes of human papillomaviruses (HPV). The most common oncogenic HPV genotypes are 16 and 18, causing approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. Types 6 and 11 do not contribute to the incidence of high-grade dysplasias (precancerous lesions) or cervical cancer, but do cause laryngeal papillomas and most genital warts. HPV is highly transmissible, with peak incidence soon after the onset of sexual activity. A quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) HPV vaccine has recently been licensed in several countries following the determination that it has an acceptable benefit/risk profile. In large phase III trials, the vaccine prevented 100% of moderate and severe precancerous cervical lesions associated with types 16 or 18 among women with no previous infection with these types. A bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine has also undergone extensive evaluation and been licensed in at least one country. Both vaccines are prepared from non-infectious, DNA-free virus-like particles produced by recombinant technology and combined with an adjuvant. With three doses administered, they induce high levels of serum antibodies in virtually all vaccinated individuals. In women who have no evidence of past or current infection with the HPV genotypes in the vaccine, both vaccines show > 90% protection against persistent HPV infection for up to 5 years after vaccination, which is the longest reported follow-up so far. Vaccinating at an age before females are exposed to HPV would have the greatest impact. Since HPV vaccines do not eliminate the risk of cervical cancer, cervical screening will still be required to minimize cancer incidence. Tiered pricing for HPV vaccines, innovative financing mechanisms and multidisciplinary partnerships will be essential in order for the vaccines to reach populations in greatest need."
vaccines,"Human tumors express a number of protein antigens that can be recognized by T cells, thus providing potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs) are rare leukocytes that are uniquely potent in their ability to present antigens to T cells, and this property has prompted their recent application to therapeutic cancer vaccines. Isolated DCs loaded with tumor antigen ex vivo and administered as a cellular vaccine have been found to induce protective and therapeutic anti-tumor immunity in experimental animals. In pilot clinical trials of DC vaccination for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma, induction of anti-tumor immune responses and tumor regressions have been observed. Additional trials of DC vaccination for a variety of human cancers are under way, and methods for targeting tumor antigens to DCs in vivo are also being explored. Exploitation of the antigen-presenting properties of DCs thus offers promise for the development of effective cancer immunotherapies."
vaccines,"In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international impact on public health. These papers, which are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes, summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with the current WHO position concerning their use in the global context. The papers have been reviewed by a number of experts within and outside WHO, and since 2006 have been reviewed and endorsed by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization. The position papers are designed for use mainly by national public health officials and managers of immunization programmes. However, they may also be of interest to international funding agencies, the vaccine manufacturing industry, the medical community, scientific media and the public."
vaccines,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to ravage humanity, causing 2 million deaths per year. A vaccine against TB more potent than the current live vaccine, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is desperately needed. Using two commercially available strains of BCG as host strains, BCG Connaught and Tice, we have constructed two recombinant BCG vaccines stably expressing and secreting the 30-kDa major secretory protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb.), the primary causative agent of TB. We have tested the efficacy of the two strains in the highly susceptible guinea pig model of pulmonary TB, a model noteworthy for its close resemblance to human TB. Animals immunized with the recombinant BCG vaccines and challenged by aerosol with a highly virulent strain of M. tb. had 0.5 logs fewer M. tb. bacilli in their lungs and 1 log fewer bacilli in their spleens on average than animals immunized with their parental conventional BCG vaccine counterparts. Statistically, these differences were highly significant. Paralleling these results, at necropsy, animals immunized with the recombinant BCG vaccines had fewer and smaller lesions in the lung, spleen, and liver and significantly less lung pathology than animals immunized with the parental BCG vaccines. The recombinant vaccines are the first vaccines against TB more potent than the current commercially available BCG vaccines, which were developed nearly a century ago."
vaccines,"The lack of robust rapid diagnostic tests, safe and effective drugs, and preventative vaccines hampers treatment of patients with invasive fungal infections. Although fungal infections contribute substantially to human morbidity and mortality, the impact of these diseases on human health is not widely appreciated. Moreover, despite the urgent need for efficient diagnostic tests and safe and effective new drugs and vaccines, research into the pathophysiology of human fungal infections lags behind that of diseases caused by other pathogens. In this Review, we highlight the importance of fungi as human pathogens and discuss the challenges we face in combating the devastating invasive infections caused by these microorganisms, in particular in immunocompromised individuals."
vaccines,"A double-blind, randomized controlled trial over 5 years compared the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of cold-adapted and inactivated influenza A vaccines in 5210 normal subjects. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Inactivated vaccine significantly increased hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers. Significant titer rises were also noted after cold-adapted vaccine but of lesser magnitude than with inactivated vaccine. The efficacy of inactivated vaccine in preventing culture-positive influenza was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58%-87%) for H1N1 disease and 74% (95% CI, 52%-86%) for H3N2; for cold-adapted vaccine, 85% (95% CI, 70%-92%) and 58% (95% CI, 29%-75%), respectively. The efficacy of inactivated vaccine in preventing a four-fold rise in antibody titer over the influenza season was 69% (95% CI, 61%-76%) for H1N1 and 73% (95% CI, 65%-79%) for H3N2; for cold-adapted vaccine, 54% (95% CI, 44%-62%) and 32% (95% CI, 17%-44%), respectively. Cold-adapted and inactivated influenza vaccines are safe and effective for preventing influenza A disease."

vaccines,"Abstract Background Safe, effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are urgently needed in children younger than 12 years of age. Methods A phase 1, dose-finding study and an ongoing phase 2–3 randomized trial are being conducted to investigate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine administered 21 days apart in children 6 months to 11 years of age. We present results for 5-to-11-year-old children. In the phase 2–3 trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the BNT162b2 vaccine at the dose level identified during the open-label phase 1 study or placebo. Immune responses 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 were immunologically bridged to those in 16-to-25-year-olds from the pivotal trial of two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose was assessed. Results During the phase 1 study, a total of 48 children 5 to 11 years of age received 10 μg, 20 μg, or 30 μg of the BNT162b2 vaccine (16 children at each dose level). On the basis of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, a dose level of 10 μg was selected for further study. In the phase 2–3 trial, a total of 2268 children were randomly assigned to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine (1517 children) or placebo (751 children). At data cutoff, the median follow-up was 2.3 months. In the 5-to-11-year-olds, as in other age groups, the BNT162b2 vaccine had a favorable safety profile. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were noted. One month after the second dose, the geometric mean ratio of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing titers in 5-to-11-year-olds to those in 16-to-25-year-olds was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 1.18), a ratio meeting the prespecified immunogenicity success criterion (lower bound of two-sided 95% CI, >0.67; geometric mean ratio point estimate, ≥0.8). Covid-19 with onset 7 days or more after the second dose was reported in three recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine and in 16 placebo recipients (vaccine efficacy, 90.7%; 95% CI, 67.7 to 98.3). Conclusions A Covid-19 vaccination regimen consisting of two 10-μg doses of BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart was found to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in children 5 to 11 years of age.

vaccines,"SUMMARY Bordetella respiratory infections are common in people (B. pertussis) and in animals (B. bronchiseptica). During the last two decades, much has been learned about the virulence determinants, pathogenesis, and immunity of Bordetella. Clinically, the full spectrum of disease due to B. pertussis infection is now understood, and infections in adolescents and adults are recognized as the reservoir for cyclic outbreaks of disease. DTaP vaccines, which are less reactogenic than DTP vaccines, are now in general use in many developed countries, and it is expected that the expansion of their use to adolescents and adults will have a significant impact on reducing pertussis and perhaps decrease the circulation of B. pertussis. Future studies should seek to determine the cause of the unique cough which is associated with Bordetella respiratory infections. It is also hoped that data gathered from molecular Bordetella research will lead to a new generation of DTaP vaccines which provide greater efficacy than is provided by today's vaccines."
vaccines,"An increasing body of evidence suggests that a vaccine that elicits anti-HIV-1 cellular immunity could provide the basis for an effective AIDS vaccine. Comparative immunization experiments testing a variety of vaccine approaches have demonstrated that replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors are an effective means for eliciting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune responses against HIV-1 antigens. These immune responses effectively control viremia in nonhuman primates following challenge with simian AIDS viruses. Such data, coupled with epidemiology studies that identify HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef as the best antigens for broadly directed cellular immune responses, provide guidance for the development of a potential AIDS vaccine."
vaccines,"Seasonal influenza continues to have a huge annual impact in the United States, accounting for tens of millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of excess hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of excess deaths. Vaccination remains the mainstay for the prevention of influenza. In the United States, 2 types of influenza vaccine are currently licensed: trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine. Both are safe and effective in the populations for which they are approved for use. Children, adults <65 years of age, and the elderly all receive substantial health benefits from vaccination. In addition, vaccination appears to be cost-effective, if not cost saving, across the age spectrum. Despite long-standing recommendations for the routine vaccination of persons in high-priority groups, US vaccination rates remain too low across all age groups. Important issues to be addressed include improving vaccine delivery to current and expanded target groups, ensuring timely availability of adequate vaccine supply, and development of even more effective vaccines. Development of a vaccine against potentially pandemic strains is an essential part of the strategy to control and prevent a pandemic outbreak. The use of existing technologies for influenza vaccine production would be the most straightforward approach, because these technologies are commercially available and licensing would be relatively simple. Approaches currently being tested include subvirion inactivated vaccines and cold-adapted, live attenuated vaccines. Preliminary results have suggested that, for some pandemic antigens, particularly H5, subvirion inactivated vaccines are poorly immunogenic, for reasons that are not clear. Data from evaluation of live pandemic vaccines are pending. Second-generation approaches designed to provide improved immune responses at lower doses have focused on adjuvants such as alum and MF59, which are currently licensed for influenza or other vaccines. Additional experimental approaches are required to achieve the ultimate goal for seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention--namely, the ability to generate broadly cross-reactive and durable protection in humans."
vaccines,"In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) vaccine,† and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for their use in persons aged ≥16 years and ≥18 years, respectively.§ In May 2021, FDA expanded the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents aged 12-15 years; ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥12 years receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Both mRNA vaccines were authorized and recommended as a 2-dose schedule, with second doses administered 21 days (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 28 days (Moderna) after the first dose. After reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in mRNA vaccine recipients,¶ which predominantly occurred in young males after the second dose, an ACIP meeting was rapidly convened to review reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis and discuss the benefits and risks of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle; if it is accompanied by pericarditis, an inflammation of the thin tissue surrounding the heart (the pericardium), it is referred to as myopericarditis. Hereafter, myocarditis is used to refer to myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis. On June 23, 2021, after reviewing available evidence including that for risks of myocarditis, ACIP determined that the benefits of using mRNA COVID-19 vaccines under the FDA's EUA clearly outweigh the risks in all populations, including adolescents and young adults. The EUA has been modified to include information on myocarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The EUA fact sheets should be provided before vaccination; in addition, CDC has developed patient and provider education materials about the possibility of myocarditis and symptoms of concern, to ensure prompt recognition and management of myocarditis."
vaccines,"The exceptional discoveries of antigen/gene delivery systems have allowed the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine candidates. This review highlights various antigen-delivery systems, particularly viral vectors, and assesses the underlying technologies in light of their use against AIDS and malaria. Although such recombinant vectors may face extensive preclinical testing and will possibly have to meet stringent regulatory requirements, some of these vectors may benefit from the profound industrial and clinical experience of the parent vaccine. Most notably, novel vaccines based on live, recombinant vectors may combine the induction of broad, strong and persistent immune responses with acceptable safety profiles."
vaccines,"Background: Infectious diseases and vaccines can occasionally cause new-onset or flare of immune-mediated diseases (IMDs). The adjuvanticity of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is based on either TLR-7/8 or TLR-9 agonism, which is distinct from previous vaccines and is a common pathogenic mechanism in IMDs. Methods: We evaluated IMD flares or new disease onset within 28-days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at five large tertiary centres in countries with early vaccination adoption, three in Israel, one in UK, and one in USA. We assessed the pattern of disease expression in terms of autoimmune, autoinflammatory, or mixed disease phenotype and organ system affected. We also evaluated outcomes. Findings: 27 cases included 17 flares and 10 new onset IMDs. 23/27 received the BNT - 162b2 vaccine, 2/27 the mRNA-1273 and 2/27 the ChAdOx1 vaccines. The mean age was 54.4 ± 19.2 years and 55% of cases were female. Among the 27 cases, 21 (78%) had at least one underlying autoimmune/rheumatic disease prior the vaccination. Among those patients with a flare or activation, four episodes occurred after receiving the second-dose and in one patient they occurred both after the first and the second-dose. In those patients with a new onset disease, two occurred after the second-dose and in one patient occurred both after the first (new onset) and second-dose (flare). For either dose, IMDs occurred on average 4 days later. Of the cases, 20/27 (75%) were mild to moderate in severity. Over 80% of cases had excellent resolution of inflammatory features, mostly with the use of corticosteroid therapy. Other immune-mediated conditions included idiopathic pericarditis (n = 2), neurosarcoidosis with small fiber neuropathy (n = 1), demyelination (n = 1), and myasthenia gravis (n = 2). In 22 cases (81.5%), the insurgence of Adverse event following immunization (AEFI)/IMD could not be explained based on the drug received by the patient. In 23 cases (85.2%), AEFI development could not be explained based on the underlying disease/co-morbidities. Only in one case (3.7%), the timing window of the insurgence of the side effect was considered not compatible with the time from vaccine to flare. Interpretation: Despite the high population exposure in the regions served by these centers, IMDs flares or onset temporally-associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination appear rare. Most are moderate in severity and responsive to therapy although some severe flares occurred. Funding: none."
vaccines,"As COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out across the world, there are growing concerns about the roles that trust, belief in conspiracy theories, and spread of misinformation through social media play in impacting vaccine hesitancy. We use a nationally representative survey of 1476 adults in the UK between 12 and 18 December 2020, along with 5 focus groups conducted during the same period. Trust is a core predictor, with distrust in vaccines in general and mistrust in government raising vaccine hesitancy. Trust in health institutions and experts and perceived personal threat are vital, with focus groups revealing that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is driven by a misunderstanding of herd immunity as providing protection, fear of rapid vaccine development and side effects, and beliefs that the virus is man-made and used for population control. In particular, those who obtain information from relatively unregulated social media sources—such as YouTube—that have recommendations tailored by watch history, and who hold general conspiratorial beliefs, are less willing to be vaccinated. Since an increasing number of individuals use social media for gathering health information, interventions require action from governments, health officials, and social media companies. More attention needs to be devoted to helping people understand their own risks, unpacking complex concepts, and filling knowledge voids."
vaccines,"Streptococcus pneumonia evades vaccines and drugs by high levels of recombination and rapid adaptation. Epidemiological studies of the naturally transformable bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae have previously been confounded by high rates of recombination. Sequencing 240 isolates of the PMEN1 (Spain23F-1) multidrug-resistant lineage enabled base substitutions to be distinguished from polymorphisms arising through horizontal sequence transfer. More than 700 recombinations were detected, with genes encoding major antigens frequently affected. Among these were 10 capsule-switching events, one of which accompanied a population shift as vaccine-escape serotype 19A isolates emerged in the USA after the introduction of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine. The evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, rifampicin, and macrolides was observed to occur on multiple occasions. This study details how genomic plasticity within lineages of recombinogenic bacteria can permit adaptation to clinical interventions over remarkably short time scales."
vaccines,"Synthetic peptide vaccines aiming at the induction of a protective CD8+ T-cell response against infectious or malignant diseases are widely used in the clinic but, despite their success in animal models, they do not yet live up to their promise in humans. This review assesses the development of synthetic peptide vaccines, weighs it against the immunological concepts that have emerged, and identifies the key issues that play a role in the failure or success of a synthetic peptide vaccine. The current state-of-the-art peptide vaccine is a complete synthetic inflammatory product that is ingested by professional antigen-presenting cells and stimulates both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells."
vaccines,"Two coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are currently authorized for use in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 11, 2020, and for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020; each is administered as a 2-dose series. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued interim recommendations for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on December 12, 2020 (1), and December 19, 2020 (2), respectively; initial doses were recommended for health care personnel and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents (3). Safety monitoring for these vaccines has been the most intense and comprehensive in U.S. history, using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting system, and v-safe,* an active surveillance system, during the initial implementation phases of the COVID-19 national vaccination program (4). CDC conducted descriptive analyses of safety data from the first month of vaccination (December 14, 2020-January 13, 2021). During this period, 13,794,904 vaccine doses were administered, and VAERS received and processed† 6,994 reports of adverse events after vaccination, including 6,354 (90.8%) that were classified as nonserious and 640 (9.2%) as serious.§ The symptoms most frequently reported to VAERS were headache (22.4%), fatigue (16.5%), and dizziness (16.5%). A total of 113 deaths were reported to VAERS, including 78 (65%) among LTCF residents; available information from death certificates, autopsy reports, medical records, and clinical descriptions from VAERS reports and health care providers did not suggest any causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and death. Rare cases of anaphylaxis after receipt of both vaccines were reported (4.5 reported cases per million doses administered). Among persons who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reactions reported to the v-safe system were more frequent after receipt of the second dose than after the first. The initial postauthorization safety profiles of the two COVID-19 vaccines in current use did not indicate evidence of unexpected serious adverse events. These data provide reassurance and helpful information regarding what health care providers and vaccine recipients might expect after vaccination."
vaccines,"The first vaccines for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States were authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (1) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in December 2020.* However, demand for COVID-19 vaccines is expected to exceed supply during the first months of the national COVID-19 vaccination program. ACIP advises CDC on population groups and circumstances for vaccine use.† On December 1, ACIP recommended that 1) health care personnel§ and 2) residents of long-term care facilities¶ be offered COVID-19 vaccination first, in Phase 1a of the vaccination program (2). On December 20, 2020, ACIP recommended that in Phase 1b, vaccine should be offered to persons aged ≥75 years and frontline essential workers (non-health care workers), and that in Phase 1c, persons aged 65-74 years, persons aged 16-64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and essential workers not recommended for vaccination in Phase 1b should be offered vaccine.** These recommendations for phased allocation provide guidance for federal, state, and local jurisdictions while vaccine supply is limited. In its deliberations, ACIP considered scientific evidence regarding COVID-19 epidemiology, ethical principles, and vaccination program implementation considerations. ACIP's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine allocation are interim and might be updated based on changes in conditions of FDA Emergency Use Authorization, FDA authorization for new COVID-19 vaccines, changes in vaccine supply, or changes in COVID-19 epidemiology."
vaccines,"• Lack of confidence in vaccines for covid-19 poses direct and indirect threats to health, and could derail efforts to end the current pandemic • Concerns about unknown future effects, side effects, and a lack of trust are common reasons given by people who say they are unlikely to have a covid-19 vaccine • No single intervention is likely to be able to address vaccine hesitancy • Consider barriers to uptake of vaccination at a population level and in groups who have lower rates of vaccine uptake • Develop local approaches by engaging members of the community and co-producing communications and materials that meet population needs"
vaccines,"Encephalitis caused by Japanese encephalitis virus occurs in annual epidemics throughout Asia, making it the principal cause of epidemic viral encephalitis in the world. No currently available vaccine has demonstrated efficacy in preventing this disease in a controlled trial. We performed a placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized trial in a northern Thai province, with two doses of monovalent (Nakayama strain) or bivalent (Nakayama plus Beijing strains) inactivated, purified Japanese encephalitis vaccine made from whole virus derived from mouse brain. We examined the effect of these vaccines on the incidence and severity of Japanese encephalitis and dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease caused by a closely related flavivirus. Between November 1984 and March 1985, 65,224 children received two doses of monovalent Japanese encephalitis vaccine (n = 21,628), bivalent Japanese encephalitis vaccine (n = 22,080), or tetanus toxoid placebo (n = 21,516), with only minor side effects. The cumulative attack rate for encephalitis due to Japanese encephalitis virus was 51 per 100,000 in the placebo group and 5 per 100,000 in each vaccine group. The efficacy in both vaccine groups combined was 91 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 70 to 97 percent). Attack rates for dengue hemorrhagic fever declined, but not significantly. The severity of cases of dengue was also reduced. We conclude that two doses of inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccine, either monovalent or bivalent, protect against encephalitis due to Japanese encephalitis virus and may have a limited beneficial effect on the severity of dengue hemorrhagic fever."
vaccines,"The World Health Organization (WHO) through its department of vaccines and biologicals already offers information and recommendations on the vaccines represented in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). According to its global mandate, the department is now assuming an extended normative role in this field, and is issuing a series of regularly updated position papers on other vaccines and vaccine combinations against diseases that have an international public health impact. These position papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programs; limited vaccination for individual protection, as executed mostly in the private sector, may be a valuable supplement to the national programs, but is not emphasized in this policy document. The position papers summarize essential background information on the respective diseases and vaccines, and conclude with the current WHO position concerning their use in the global context. The papers have been reviewed by a number of experts inside and outside WHO, and are designed for use mainly by national public-health officials and immunization program managers. However, the position papers may also be of interest to international funding agencies, the vaccine manufacturing industry, the medical community, and the scientific media."
vaccines,"Ticks are distributed worldwide and impact human and animal health, as well as food animal production. Control of ticks has been primarily by application of acaricides, which has resulted in selection of resistant ticks and environmental pollution. Vaccines have been shown to be a feasible tick control method that offers a cost‐effective, environmentally friendly alternative to chemical control. However, identification of tick‐protective antigens remains the limiting step in vaccine development. Tick antigens exposed naturally to the host during tick feeding and those concealed have both shown promise as candidate vaccine antigens. Development of vaccines against multiple tick species may be possible using highly conserved tick‐protective antigens or by antigens showing immune cross‐reaction to different tick species. Vaccines made from a combination of key protective antigens may greatly enhance vaccine efficacy. Preliminary studies have suggested the possibility of vaccine strategies directed toward both tick control and the blocking of pathogen transmission. Characterization of the tick genomes will have a great impact on the discovery of new protective antigens. The future of research directed toward tick vaccine development is exciting because of new and emerging technologies for gene discovery, and vaccine formulation and delivery."
vaccines,"Vaccinations are one of the most important preventive tools against infectious diseases. Over time, many different types of vaccines have been developed concerning the antigen component. Adjuvants are essential elements that increase the efficacy of vaccination practises through many different actions, especially acting as carriers, depots, and stimulators of immune responses. For many years, few adjuvants have been included in vaccines, with aluminium salts being the most commonly used adjuvant. However, recent research has focused its attention on many different new compounds with effective adjuvant properties and improved safety. Modern technologies such as nanotechnologies and molecular biology have forcefully entered the production processes of both antigen and adjuvant components, thereby improving vaccine efficacy. Microparticles, emulsions, and immune stimulators are currently in the spotlight for their huge potential in vaccine production. Although studies have reported some potential side effects of vaccine adjuvants such as the recently recognised ASIA syndrome, the huge worth of vaccines remains unquestionable. Indeed, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of vaccines, especially in regard to managing future potential pandemics. In this field, research into adjuvants could play a leading role in the production of increasingly effective vaccines."
vaccines,"COVID-19 vaccines are a critical tool for controlling the ongoing global pandemic. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorizations for three COVID-19 vaccines for use in the United States.* In large, randomized-controlled trials, each vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (1-3). Despite the high level of vaccine efficacy, a small percentage of fully vaccinated persons (i.e. received all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine) will develop symptomatic or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (2-8)."
vaccines,"Rotavirus vaccine development has focused on the delivery of live attenuated rotavirus strains by the oral route. The initial ""Jennerian"" approach involving bovine (RIT4237, WC3) or rhesus (RRV) rotavirus vaccine candidates showed that these vaccines were safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic but induced highly variable rates of protection against rotavirus diarrhea. The goal of a rotavirus vaccine is to prevent severe illness that can lead to dehydration in infants and young children in both developed and developing countries. These studies led to the concept that a multivalent vaccine that represented each of the four epidemiologically important VP7 serotypes might be necessary to induce protection in young infants, the target population for vaccination. Human-animal rotavirus reassortants whose gene encoding VP7 was derived from their human rotavirus parent but whose remaining genes were derived from the animal rotavirus parent were developed as vaccine candidates. The greatest experience with a multivalent vaccine to date has been gained with the quadrivalent preparation containing RRV (VP7 serotype 3) and human-RRV reassortants of VP7 serotype 1, 2, and 4 specificity. Preliminary efficacy trial results in the United States have been promising, whereas a study in Peru has shown only limited protection. Human-bovine reassortant vaccines, including a candidate that contains the VP4 gene of a human rotavirus (VP4 serotype 1A), are also being studied."
vaccines,"Preclinical studies have shown that photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors augments the host antitumor immune response. However, the role of the PDT effect on tumor cells as opposed to the host tissues has not been determined. To test the contribution of the direct effects of PDT on tumor cells to the enhanced antitumor response by the host, we examined the immunogenicity of PDT-generated murine tumor cell lysates in a preclinical vaccine model. We found that the PDT-generated tumor cell lysates were potent vaccines and that PDT-generated vaccines are more effective than other modes of creating whole tumor vaccines, i.e., UV or ionizing irradiation, and unlike other traditional vaccines, PDT vaccines do not require coadministration of an adjuvant to be effective. PDT vaccines are tumor specific and appear to induce a cytotoxic T-cell response. We have demonstrated that although both UV and PDT-generated tumor cell lysates are able to induce phenotypic DC maturation, only PDT-generated lysates are able to activate DCs to express IL-12, which is critical to the development of a cellular immune response. Our results show that PDT effects on tumor cells alone are sufficient to generate an antitumor immune response, indicating that the direct tumor effects of PDT play an important role in enhancing that host antitumor immune response. These studies also suggest that in addition to the role of PDT as a therapeutic modality, PDT-generated vaccines may have clinical potential as an adjuvant therapy."
vaccines,"Conjugate vaccines have reduced the incidence of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae, type b (Hib), in industrialized countries and may be highly effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the serotype specificity of these vaccines has led to concern that their use may increase carriage of and disease from serotypes not included in the vaccine. Replacement has not occurred with the use of Hib vaccines but has occurred in trials of pneumococcal vaccines. Mathematical models can be used to elucidate these contrasting outcomes, predict the conditions under which serotype replacement is likely, interpret the results of conjugate vaccine trials, design trials that will better detect serotype replacement (if it occurs), and suggest factors to consider in choosing the serotype composition of vaccines."
vaccines,Salmonella infections are a serious medical and veterinary problem world-wide and cause concern in the food industry. Vaccination is an effective tool for the prevention of Salmonella infections. Host resistance to Salmonella relies initially on the production of inflammatory cytokines leading to the infiltration of activated inflammatory cells in the tissues. Thereafter T- and B-cell dependent specific immunity develops allowing the clearance of Salmonella microorganisms from the tissues and the establishment of long-lasting acquired immunity to re-infection. The increased resistance that develops after primary infection/ vaccination requires T-cells cytokines such as IFNgamma TNFalpha and IL12 in addition to opsonising antibody. However for reasons that are not fully understood seroconversion and/or the presence of detectable T-cell memory do not always correlate with the development of acquired resistance to infection.Whole-cell killed vaccines and subunit vaccines are used in the prevention of Salmonella infection in animals and in humans with variable results. A number of early live Salmonella vaccines derived empirically by chemical or u.v. mutagenesis proved to be immunogenic and protective and are still in use despite the need for repeated parenteral administration. Recent progress in the knowledge of the genetics of Salmonella virulence and modern recombinant DNA technology offers the possibility to introduce multiple defined attenuating and irreversible mutations into the bacterial genome. This has recently allowed the development of Salmonella strains devoid of significant side effects but still capable of inducing solid immunity after single oral administration. Live attenuated Salmonella vaccines have been used for the expression of heterologous antigens/proteins that can be successfully delivered to the immune system. Furthermore Salmonella can transfer plasmids encoding foreign antigens under the control of eukaryotic promoters (DNA vaccines) to antigen-presenting cells resulting in targeted delivery of DNA vaccines to these cells. Despite the great recent advances in the development of Salmonella vaccines a large proportion of the work has been conducted in laboratory rodents and more research in other animal species is required.
vaccines,"Recent surveys found that an increasing number of parents are concerned that infants receive too many vaccines. Implicit in this concern is that the infant's immune system is inadequately developed to handle vaccines safely or that multiple vaccines may overwhelm the immune system. In this review, we will examine the following: 1) the ontogeny of the active immune response and the ability of neonates and young infants to respond to vaccines; 2) the theoretic capacity of an infant's immune system; 3) data that demonstrate that mild or moderate illness does not interfere with an infant's ability to generate protective immune responses to vaccines; 4) how infants respond to vaccines given in combination compared with the same vaccines given separately; 5) data showing that vaccinated children are not more likely to develop infections with other pathogens than unvaccinated children; and 6) the fact that infants actually encounter fewer antigens in vaccines today than they did 40 or 100 years ago."
vaccines,"OBJECTIVE
To compare the immunogenicity of a licensed conventional whole-cell (WCL) and 13 diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines that differed in source, method of manufacture, and included antigens; all vaccines included diphtheria and tetanus toxoids.


METHODS
Healthy infants were enrolled through six university-based vaccine and treatment evaluation units and were randomized to receive one of the study vaccines at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Sera were obtained before the first immunization and 1 month after the third immunization and were analyzed for antibody to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin, fimbriae, pertactin, and diphtheria and tetanus toxins. Chinese hamster ovary cell toxin neutralization assays were performed, and levels of agglutinating antibodies were determined.


RESULTS
Of 2342 infants enrolled, 1942 contributed usable preimmunization and postimmunization serum specimens. Each vaccine produced significant increases in antibodies directed against the included antigens; postimmunization antibody titers differed significantly among the DTaP vaccines. For each evaluated antigen, the majority of DTaP vaccines produced antibody responses that equaled or exceeded those produced by WCL. For some antigens (eg, PT), mean antibody levels by vaccine correlated poorly with the quantity of antigen included in each vaccine; for others (eg., fimbriae), there was a close correlation.


CONCLUSION
Although serologic correlates of pertussis immunity are not defined, it is clear that DTaP vaccines can stimulate immune responses that exceed those of licensed whole-cell vaccine with respect to the measured antibodies. Particularly for PT, immunogenicity seems to depend on factors in addition to antigen concentration, possibly including antigen derivation and formulation. No DTaP was most or least immunogenic with respect to all included antigens."
vaccines,"The regime of administering the infectious bronchitis (IB) Ma5 vaccine (Massachusetts serotype) at 1 day old and the heterologous 4/91 vaccine at 2 weeks of age, was shown to be highly effective in protecting the respiratory tract of specified pathogen free chickens. Protection, as measured by assessing ciliary activity of the tracheal epithelium following challenge, was excellent against challenge at 5 weeks of age with IB strains of many serotypes, isolated from disease outbreaks in different parts of the world. This vaccination protocol was more effective than revaccination with a vaccine of the same serotype as the first vaccine. Furthermore, significantly better protection was seen when the Ma5 vaccine was given before, rather than at the same time as or following, the 4/91 vaccine. It is suggested that the use of these two IB vaccines will frequently broaden the protection possible against challenge with IB isolates of many different serotypes, without the need to develop a new IB vaccine to combat each new IB serotype that emerges."
vaccines,"Background. Influenza is a common and potentially serious infection in children. Although there is interest in broadening the use of influenza vaccine in healthy children, there are few large, randomized, controlled trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of inactivated vaccine in the pediatric population. Methods. From 1985 through 1990 a randomized, controlled trial of cold-adapted and inactivated vaccines for the prevention of influenza A disease was conducted at Vanderbilt University, and the cumulative results from this trial in patients of all ages have been previously published. We reanalyzed the data from this trial in the subset of patients who were younger than 16 years at the time of their participation. We determined vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy, based on culture-positive illness and seroconversion, in this subset of patients. Results. During the 5 years of the study, 791 children younger than 16 years received 1809 doses of either inactivated or cold-adapted vaccine or placebo. The vaccines were well-tolerated, and there were no serious reactions. Inactivated trivalent influenza vaccines were 91.4 and 77.3% efficacious in preventing symptomatic, culture-positive influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 illness, respectively. The efficacy of the inactivated vaccine based on hemagglutination inhibition assay seroconversion was 67.1 and 65.5%, respectively, for H1N1 and H3N2 serotypes. Conclusions. Inactivated trivalent influenza A vaccines are well-tolerated and efficacious in the prevention of influenza A disease in children 1 to 16 years old."
vaccines,"Understanding and minimizing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) vaccine hesitancy is critical to population health and minimizing health inequities, which continue to be brought into stark relief by the pandemic. We investigate questions regarding vaccine hesitancy in a sample (n = 1205) of Arkansas adults surveyed online in July/August of 2020. We examine relationships among sociodemographics, COVID‐19 health literacy, fear of COVID‐19 infection, general trust in vaccines, and COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy using bivariate analysis and a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) logistic regression model. One in five people (21,21.86%) reported hesitancy to take a COVID‐19 vaccine. Prevalence of COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy was highest among Black/African Americans (50.00%), respondents with household income less than $25K (30.68%), some college (32.17%), little to no fear of infection from COVID‐19 (62.50%), and low trust in vaccines in general (55.84%). Odds of COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy were 2.42 greater for Black/African American respondents compared to White respondents (p < 0.001), 1.67 greater for respondents with some college/technical degree compared to respondents with a 4‐year degree (p < 0.05), 5.48 greater for respondents with no fear of COVID‐19 infection compared to those who fear infection to a great extent (p < 0.001), and 11.32 greater for respondents with low trust in vaccines (p < 0.001). Sociodemographic differences in COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy raise concerns about the potential of vaccine implementation to widen existing health disparities in COVID‐19 related infections, particularly among Black/African Americans. Fear of infection and general mistrust in vaccines are significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy."
vaccines,"Building Better Vaccines Vaccines are one of the most effective tools to protect against infectious diseases. Unfortunately, vaccines for diseases with the highest global health burdens, such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis, are not yet available. Koff et al. (p. 1064) review the latest advances in vaccine development and why these particular diseases remain such a challenge. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children worldwide. Although a prophylactic antibody is available for children at high risk, a vaccine is much needed. As a potential step toward this goal, McLellan et al. (p. 1113, published online 25 April) solved the cocrystal structure of a neutralizing antibody (D25) bound to the prefusion F protein of RSV. Knowledge of the structure of the prefusion protein should help to guide vaccine design and the development of additional therapeutics. The prefusion conformation of respiratory syncytial virus protein F has been trapped by a neutralizing antibody. The prefusion state of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) glycoprotein is the target of most RSV-neutralizing activity in human sera, but its metastability has hindered characterization. To overcome this obstacle, we identified prefusion-specific antibodies that were substantially more potent than the prophylactic antibody palivizumab. The cocrystal structure for one of these antibodies, D25, in complex with the F glycoprotein revealed D25 to lock F in its prefusion state by binding to a quaternary epitope at the trimer apex. Electron microscopy showed that two other antibodies, AM22 and 5C4, also bound to the newly identified site of vulnerability, which we named antigenic site Ø. These studies should enable design of improved vaccine antigens and define new targets for passive prevention of RSV-induced disease."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT The plethora of newly discovered vaccines implies that, in the future, many vaccines will have to be administered simultaneously to infants. We examined the potential interference with the immune response of several coadministered vaccines containing the same protein component, namely, tetanus toxoid (TT). Infants simultaneously receiving a tetravalent pneumococcal vaccine conjugated to TT (PncT) and a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis–poliovirus–Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus conjugate vaccine showed significantly lower anti-H. influenzae type b polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate [PRP]) antibody concentrations than those receiving either a tetravalent pneumococcal vaccine conjugated to diphtheria toxoid or placebo. A dose range study showed that anti-PRP antibody concentrations were inversely related to the TT content of the PncT vaccines administered in infancy. Postimmunization antitetanus antibody concentrations were also affected adversely as the TT content of the coadministered vaccines was increased. This phenomenon, which we believe derives from interference by a common protein carrier, should be taken into account when the introduction of an immunization program including multiple conjugate vaccines is considered."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Long-term control of the COVID-19 pandemic hinges in part on the development and uptake of a preventive vaccine. In addition to a segment of population that refuses vaccines, the novelty of the disease and concerns over safety and efficacy of the vaccine have a sizable proportion of the U.S. indicating reluctance to getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Among various efforts to address vaccine hesitancy and foster vaccine confidence, evidence-based communication strategies are critical. There are opportunities to consider the role of emotion in communication efforts. In this commentary, we highlight several ways negative as well as positive emotions may be considered and leveraged. Examples include attending to negative emotions such as fear and anxiety, raising awareness of emotional manipulations by anti-vaccine disinformation efforts, and activating positive emotions such as altruism and hope as part of vaccine education endeavors."
vaccines,"Use of BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccines increased in Europe after World War II and in developing countries starting in the 1950s to the extent that the vaccines have now been given to over 3 billion people. In a major evaluation of BCG's safety, researchers attempted to catalog all adverse events reported as attributed to BCG vaccination. Two conclusions are notable. First, the reports of severe neurologic or fatal sequelae indicate that the risk of such events is extremely rare, far less than that reported for the smallpox vaccine. Second, BCG vaccines are associated with a variety of more common minor adverse effects in addition to induration and ulceration of the vaccination site, which occur in almost all vaccines. The authors believe that such studies may identify useful surrogate markers for the evaluation of different preparations of BCG or new vaccines against tuberculosis. Although BCG is effective in developing type I CD4 T-cell responses, it is still unclear how effective it is in generating MHC class I-restricted CTL responses. It may ultimately be necessary to identify the molecules, either enzymes or lysins, that enable M. tuberculosis to escape from phagolysosomes into the cytoplasm in order to develop recombinant BCG vaccines that are effective in inducing both CD8- and CD4-type protective responses. Just as the BCG trials have provided our most detailed studies of the epidemiology of tuberculosis, so basic research directed at tuberculosis vaccines is leading the way in understanding pathogenesis of the disease."
vaccines,"Since mid-2006, a licensed human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been available and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for routine vaccination of adolescent girls at ages 11 or 12 years. Two vaccines that protect against HPV infection are currently available in the United States. Both the quadrivalent (HPV4) and bivalent (HPV2) vaccines protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which cause 70% of cervical cancers; HPV4 also protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital warts. In 2011, the ACIP also recommended HPV4 for the routine vaccination of adolescent boys at ages 11 or 12 years. HPV vaccines can be safely co-administered with other routinely recommended vaccines, and ACIP recommends administration of all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. To assess progress with HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years, characterize adherence with recommendations for HPV vaccination by the 13th birthday, and describe HPV vaccine adverse reports received postlicensure, CDC analyzed data from the 2007-2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) and national postlicensure vaccine safety data among females and males. Vaccination coverage with ≥1 dose of any HPV vaccine increased significantly from 53.8% (2012) to 57.3% (2013) among adolescent girls and from 20.8% (2012) to 34.6% (2013) among adolescent boys. Receipt of ≥1 dose of HPV among girls by age 13 years increased with each birth cohort; however, missed vaccination opportunities were common. Had HPV vaccine been administered to adolescent girls born in 2000 during health care visits when they received another vaccine, vaccination coverage for ≥1 dose by age 13 years for this cohort could have reached 91.3%. Postlicensure monitoring data continue to indicate that HPV4 is safe. Improving practice patterns so that clinicians use every opportunity to recommend HPV vaccines and address questions from parents can help realize reductions in vaccine-preventable infections and cancers caused by HPV."
vaccines,"During the last few years, the use of vaccines for disease prevention in aquaculture has expanded both with regard to the number of fish species and number of microbial diseases. According to the responses to a questionnaire received from 41 countries, vaccination is used in the commercial aquaculture of species like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), sea bream (Sparus aurata), barramundi (Lates calcarifer), tilapia (Tilapia spp), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.), yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata), purplish and gold-striped amberjack (Seriola dumereli), striped jack (Pseudocaranx dentex) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). The range of bacterial infections for which vaccines are commercially available now comprises classical vibriosis (Listonella anguillarum, Vibrio ordalii), furunculosis (Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida), cold-water vibriosis (Vibrio salmonicida), yersiniosis (Yersinia ruckeri), pasteurellosis (Photobacterium damselae supsp. piscicida), edwardsiellosis (Edwardsiella ictaluri), winter ulcer (Moritella viscosa), and streptococcosis/lactococcosis (Streptococcus iniae, Lactococcus garviae). Furthermore, experimental vaccines are used against diseases such as infection with Vibrio harveyi and Photobacterium damsela subsp. damsela in barramundi, piscirickettsiosis and bacterial kidney disease in salmonids, as well as infection with Flexibacter maritimus (now: Tenacibaculum maritimum) in turbot. There was good agreement between the information received from different sources in the same country. Most vaccines are licensed products, but some non-licensed vaccines are also used in commercial fish farms. Most bacterial vaccines are inactivated products and recombinant vaccine technology has so far been used to a very limited extent. Salmonid fish are usually immunised with multivalent vaccines by intraperitoneal injection. In marine fish species vaccination is generally performed by immersion, but use of injection vaccination is increasing, particularly in the Mediterranean region. Only limited use of orally administered fish vaccines is reported. In general, the effect of vaccination against bacterial infections is good. The best protection is obtained with injectable, adjuvanted vaccines. However, injection-site adverse reactions often occur when such products are used."
vaccines,"The need to enhance the immunogenicity of purified subunit antigens has prompted the development of several new adjuvants. However, many of these new molecules have demonstrated a reactogenicity profile that is not suitable for their inclusion in vaccines for human use. In this context, the adjuvant emulsion MF59™ has been developed, tested in combination with different antigens in several animal models and subsequently evaluated in humans. Clinical trials with several MF59-adjuvanted vaccines have been performed in different age groups (from newborns to the elderly) and have shown an increased immunogenicity of coadministered antigens, associated with a high level of safety and tolerability. MF59 has been the first adjuvant to be licensed for human use after alum and, as part of an enhanced influenza vaccine for the elderly, is now available in the marketplace of several countries worldwide."
vaccines,"Routine immunization is recommended for adolescents aged 11-12 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for protection against diseases including pertussis, meningococcal disease, and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers. To assess vaccination coverage among adolescents, CDC analyzed data collected regarding 20,827 adolescents through the 2014 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen). From 2013 to 2014, coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years increased for all routinely recommended vaccines: from 84.7% to 87.6% for ≥1 tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine dose, from 76.6% to 79.3% for ≥1 meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine dose, from 56.7% to 60.0% and from 33.6% to 41.7% for ≥1 HPV vaccine dose among females and males, respectively.† Coverage differed by state and local area. Despite overall progress in vaccination coverage among adolescents, HPV vaccination coverage continues to lag behind Tdap and MenACWY coverage at state and national levels.

vaccines,"ABSTRACT Despite major advances in vaccination over the past century, resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses has led the World Health Organization to identify vaccine hesitancy as a major threat to global health. Vaccine hesitancy may be fueled by health information obtained from a variety of sources, including new media such as the Internet and social media platforms. As access to technology has improved, social media has attained global penetrance. In contrast to traditional media, social media allow individuals to rapidly create and share content globally without editorial oversight. Users may self-select content streams, contributing to ideological isolation. As such, there are considerable public health concerns raised by anti-vaccination messaging on such platforms and the consequent potential for downstream vaccine hesitancy, including the compromise of public confidence in future vaccine development for novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the current position of social media platforms in propagating vaccine hesitancy and explore next steps in how social media may be used to improve health literacy and foster public trust in vaccination."

vaccines,"ABSTRACT Background The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is on the way. To prepare for public availability, the acceptability of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) were assessed to provide insights into future demand forecasts and pricing considerations. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive the vaccine and the WTP. Results A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent (29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of infection (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.19–5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less worry (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.03–4.65), were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the amount that participants were willing to pay for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine was MYR$134.0 (SD±79.2) [US$30.66 ± 18.12]. Most of the participants were willing to pay an amount of MYR$100 [US$23] (28.9%) and MYR$50 [US$11.5] (27.2%) for the vaccine. The higher marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by no affordability barriers as well as by socio-economic factors, such as higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations and higher incomes. Conclusions The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intention and WTP."
vaccines,"Vaccination, despite being recognized as one of the most effective primary public health measures, is viewed as unsafe and unnecessary by an increasing number of individuals. Anxiety about vaccines and vaccination programs leading to vaccine hesitancy results from a complex mix of social and political influences, cultural and religious beliefs, the availability of and ability to interpret health and scientific information, and personal and population experiences of health systems and government policies. Vaccine hesitancy is becoming a serious threat to vaccination programs, and was identified as one of the World Health Organization’s top ten global health threats in 2019. The negative impact of anti-vaccination movements is frequently cited as one of the major reasons for rising vaccine hesitancy amongst the general public world-wide. This review discusses the various issues surrounding vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement, starting with the definitions of vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement in their early history and in the modern era, before discussing the key drivers of vaccine hesitancy, particularly across different regions of the world, with a focus on various countries with low-, middle-, or high-income economies with different socio-economic populations. The review concludes with the impact of vaccine hesitancy on herd immunity and social, psychological, and public health measures to counter vaccine hesitancy."

vaccines,"Case-control and cohort studies may be employed to assess the protective efficacy of vaccines. The appropriate measure of vaccine efficacy is shown to depend upon the mode of action of the vaccination. Two models of vaccine action are considered. In the first, vaccination is assumed to reduce the instantaneous disease-rate in the total vaccinated population by a constant proportion and, in the second, vaccination is assumed to render a constant proportion of individuals totally immune from the disease. The implications of these two models on the behaviour of different measures of vaccine efficacy in cohort studies is explored. It is shown that the design of case-control studies to measure vaccine efficacy is dependent upon which model is considered appropriate. In particular, under the second model, individuals who have already had the disease under study should not be excluded from the control group."
vaccines,"Clinical studies of 6- and 12-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccines were carried out in controlled studies among novice gold miners in South Africa. In the studies 1,523 persons received pneumococcal vaccine, and 3,171 were included as controls. In the great majority of subjects given pneumococcal vaccine, antibodies developed against the capsular types included in the vaccine. The 6-valent vaccine afforded 76% reduction in cases of laboratory-verified pneumococcal pneumonia caused by the homologous types, and there was 92% reduction in the cases afforded by the 12-valent vaccine. The vaccines were well tolerated and offer great promise for effective control of illnesses caused by pneumococci."
vaccines,"Vaccination has made an enormous contribution to global health. Two major infections, smallpox and rinderpest, have been eradicated. Global coverage of vaccination against many important infectious diseases of childhood has been enhanced dramatically since the creation of WHO's Expanded Programme of Immunization in 1974 and of the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization in 2000. Polio has almost been eradicated and success in controlling measles makes this infection another potential target for eradication. Despite these successes, approximately 6.6 million children still die each year and about a half of these deaths are caused by infections, including pneumonia and diarrhoea, which could be prevented by vaccination. Enhanced deployment of recently developed pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines should, therefore, result in a further decline in childhood mortality. Development of vaccines against more complex infections, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, has been challenging and achievements so far have been modest. Final success against these infections may require combination vaccinations, each component stimulating a different arm of the immune system. In the longer term, vaccines are likely to be used to prevent or modulate the course of some non-infectious diseases. Progress has already been made with therapeutic cancer vaccines and future potential targets include addiction, diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease."
vaccines,"To update the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for vaccination in adult patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) published in 2011. Four systematic literature reviews were performed regarding the incidence/prevalence of vaccine-preventable infections among patients with AIIRD; efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of vaccines; effect of anti-rheumatic drugs on the response to vaccines; effect of vaccination of household of AIIRDs patients. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion. The updated recommendations comprise six overarching principles and nine recommendations. The former address the need for an annual vaccination status assessment, shared decision-making and timing of vaccination, favouring vaccination during quiescent disease, preferably prior to the initiation of immunosuppression. Non-live vaccines can be safely provided to AIIRD patients regardless of underlying therapy, whereas live-attenuated vaccines may be considered with caution. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination should be strongly considered for the majority of patients with AIIRD. Tetanus toxoid and human papilloma virus vaccination should be provided to AIIRD patients as recommended for the general population. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and herpes zoster vaccination should be administered to AIIRD patients at risk. Immunocompetent household members of patients with AIIRD should receive vaccines according to national guidelines, except for the oral poliomyelitis vaccine. Live-attenuated vaccines should be avoided during the first 6 months of life in newborns of mothers treated with biologics during the second half of pregnancy. These 2019 EULAR recommendations provide an up-to-date guidance on the management of vaccinations in patients with AIIRD."
vaccines,"PROBLEM/CONDITION
Overall, the prevalence of illness attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases is greater among adults than among children. Adults are recommended to receive vaccinations based on their age, underlying medical conditions, lifestyle, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among U.S. adults is low.


REPORTING PERIOD
August 2013-June 2014 (for influenza vaccination) and January-December 2014 (for pneumococcal, tetanus and diphtheria [Td] and tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination).


DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. The survey objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors.


RESULTS
Compared with data from the 2013 NHIS, increases in vaccination coverage occurred for Tdap vaccine among adults aged ≥19 years (a 2.9 percentage point increase to 20.1%) and herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged ≥60 years (a 3.6 percentage point increase to 27.9%). Aside from these modest improvements, vaccination coverage among adults in 2014 was similar to estimates from 2013 (for influenza coverage, similar to the 2012-13 season). Influenza vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 43.2%. Pneumococcal vaccination coverage among high-risk persons aged 19-64 years was 20.3% and among adults aged ≥65 years was 61.3%. Td vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 62.2%. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 9.0%. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 24.5%. HPV vaccination coverage among adults aged 19-26 years was 40.2% for females and 8.2% for males. Racial/ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines, with higher coverage generally for whites compared with most other groups. Adults without health insurance were significantly less likely than those with health insurance to report receipt of influenza vaccine (aged ≥19 years), pneumococcal vaccine (aged 19-64 years with high-risk conditions and aged ≥65 years), Td vaccine (aged ≥19 years), Tdap vaccine (aged ≥19 years and 19-64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (aged ≥19 years overall and among travelers), hepatitis B vaccine (aged ≥19 years, 19-49 years, and 19-59 years with diabetes), herpes zoster vaccine (aged ≥60 years and 60-64 years), and HPV vaccine (females aged 19-26 years and males aged 19-26 years). Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally were more likely to receive recommended vaccinations than those who did not have a usual place for health care, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was significantly higher among those reporting one or more physician contacts in the past year compared with those who had not visited a physician in the past year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, 23.8%-88.8% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with some specific indication. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born respondents was significantly higher than that of foreign-born respondents with few exceptions (influenza vaccination [adults aged 19-49 years], hepatitis A vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years], hepatitis B vaccination [adults with diabetes aged ≥60 years], and HPV vaccination [males aged 19-26 years]).


INTERPRETATION
Overall, increases in adult vaccination coverage are needed. Although modest gains occurred in Tdap vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years and herpes zoster vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥60 years, coverage for other vaccines and risk groups did not improve, and racial/ethnic disparities persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Coverage for all vaccines for adults remained low, and missed opportunities to vaccinate adults continued. Although having health insurance coverage and a usual place for health care are associated with higher vaccination coverage, these factors alone do not assure optimal adult vaccination coverage.


PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS
Assessing associations with vaccination is important for understanding factors that contribute to low coverage rates and to disparities in vaccination, and for implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage. Practices that have been demonstrated to improve vaccination coverage should be used. These practices include assessment of patients' vaccination indications by health care providers and routine recommendation and offer of needed vaccines to adults, implementation of reminder-recall systems, use of standing-order programs for vaccination, and assessment of practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff members. For vaccination to be improved among those least likely to be up-to-date on recommended adult vaccines, efforts also are needed to identify adults who do not have a regular provider or insurance and who report fewer health care visits."

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization is important for transmission of the organisms. We assessed the ability of two tetravalent conjugate vaccines administered in early infancy to prevent carriage of vaccine-related pneumococci.


METHODS
A vaccine containing pneumococcal type 6B, 14, 19F and 23F polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid (Pnc-T) and a vaccine containing the same four polysaccharides conjugated to diphtheria toxoid (Pnc-D) were compared with placebo, in a double blinded study (25 infants per group). Vaccines (or placebo) were injected at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. At 12 months of age a native (nonconjugate) polysaccharide vaccine was administered as a booster. Serum type-specific anticapsular antibody concentrations were measured and nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained at 2, 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13 months of age.


RESULTS
In general carriage of all pneumococci (vaccine- and non-vaccine-related) was low at age 2 months and increased with age. However, for the vaccine-related serotypes (6A, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F) carriage was not increased with age in Pnc-D or Pnc-T recipients. Of all cultures obtained after the full primary series, 7 of 72 (10%), 3 of 62 (5%) and 19 or 70 (27%) were positive for the vaccine-related pneumococcal serotypes among the Pnc-D, Pnc-T and placebo recipients, respectively (P = 0.001 for Pnc-D vs. placebo; P = 0.014 for Pnc-T vs. placebo). Most of the antibiotic-resistant isolates belonged to the vaccine-related serotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
A significant reduction in the carriage of vaccine-related strains after administration of conjugate vaccines was observed. These preliminary results suggest that transmission of specific pneumococcal serotypes most often associated with disease and antibiotic resistance may at least partially be controlled by immunization."
vaccines,"Worldwide vaccination programs against infectious diseases and toxins are estimated to save approximately 3 million lives yearly. Tragically, however, another 3 million individuals (primarily children) die of vaccine-preventable diseases. A significant portion of this problem results from the thermal instability of many of the currently used vaccines. This review argues that modern methods of physical and chemical analysis permit for the first time characterization of the degradative pathways of thermally labile vaccines. A rigorous description of these pathways permit a more rational and systematic approach to the stabilization of vaccines. A direct result of the replacement of currently employed, primarily empirical, approaches to vaccine stabilization with a more molecular-based methodology should be the development of more universally available vaccinations against life-threatening diseases. This has the potential to have a dramatic impact on world health."
vaccines,"For the past 2 decades, rotavirus infection, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children, has been a priority target for vaccine development. This decision to develop rotavirus vaccines is predicated on the great burden associated with fatal rotavirus disease (i.e., 440,000 deaths/year), the firm scientific basis for developing live oral vaccines, the belief that increased investment in development at this time could speed the introduction of vaccines in developing countries, and the appreciation that implementation of a vaccine program should result in a measurable decrease in the number of hospitalizations and deaths associated with rotavirus disease within 2-3 years. RotaShield (Wyeth-Ayerst), the first rotavirus vaccine licensed in the United States, was withdrawn after 9 months because of a rare association of the vaccine with the development of intussusception. In the developing world, this vaccine could still have had a measurable effect, because the benefits of preventing deaths due to rotavirus disease would have been substantially greater than the rare risk of intussusception. Two live oral vaccines being prepared by GlaxoSmithKline and Merck have completed large-scale clinical trials. The GlaxoSmithKline vaccine has been licensed in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, and the Merck vaccine could be licensed in the United States within 1 year; several other candidate vaccines are in earlier stages of testing. However, many challenges remain before any of these vaccines can be incorporated into childhood immunization programs in the developing world. First, vaccine efficacy, which has already been demonstrated in children in industrialized and middle-income countries, needs to be proven in poor developing countries in Africa and Asia. The safety of vaccines with regard to the associated risk of intussusception must be demonstrated as well. Novel financing strategies will be needed to ensure that new vaccines are affordable and available in the developing world. Decision makers and parents in developing countries need to know about this disease that has little name recognition and is rarely diagnosed. Finally, for the global effort toward the prevention of rotavirus disease to be successful, special efforts will be required in India, China, and Indonesia, because one-third of all deaths due to rotavirus disease occur in these countries, and because these countries depend almost entirely on vaccines manufactured domestically."
vaccines,"Conventional vaccine strategies have been highly efficacious for several decades in reducing mortality and morbidity due to infectious diseases. The bane of conventional vaccines, such as those that include whole organisms or large proteins, appear to be the inclusion of unnecessary antigenic load that, not only contributes little to the protective immune response, but complicates the situation by inducing allergenic and/or reactogenic responses. Peptide vaccines are an attractive alternative strategy that relies on usage of short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses, consequently avoiding allergenic and/or reactogenic sequences. Conversely, peptide vaccines used in isolation are often weakly immunogenic and require particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting. In this article, we discuss the specific advantages and considerations in targeted induction of immune responses by peptide vaccines and progresses in the development of such vaccines against various diseases. Additionally, we also discuss the development of particulate carrier strategies and the inherent challenges with regard to safety when combining such technologies with peptide vaccines."
vaccines,"In low-income countries, infectious diseases still account for a large proportion of deaths, highlighting health inequities largely caused by economic differences. Vaccination can cut health-care costs and reduce these inequities. Disease control, elimination or eradication can save billions of US dollars for communities and countries. Vaccines have lowered the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and will control cervical cancer. Travellers can be protected against ""exotic"" diseases by appropriate vaccination. Vaccines are considered indispensable against bioterrorism. They can combat resistance to antibiotics in some pathogens. Noncommunicable diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease, could also be reduced by influenza vaccination. Immunization programmes have improved the primary care infrastructure in developing countries, lowered mortality in childhood and empowered women to better plan their families, with consequent health, social and economic benefits. Vaccination helps economic growth everywhere, because of lower morbidity and mortality. The annual return on investment in vaccination has been calculated to be between 12% and 18%. Vaccination leads to increased life expectancy. Long healthy lives are now recognized as a prerequisite for wealth, and wealth promotes health. Vaccines are thus efficient tools to reduce disparities in wealth and inequities in health."
vaccines,"Unlike some other parasites, Leishmania can be grown in cell-free media with ease. This simple cultivation and the use of killed parasites as skin-test antigens (leishmanin) for diagnosis in humans during the past several decades have prompted scientists to try using the killed parasites, with or without adjuvant, as vaccines or for immunotherapy. In addition, different recombinant molecules, either parasite fractions or genetically engineered organisms (i.e. Leishmania made avirulent by removing specific genes, or bacteria carrying and expressing leishmanial genes), are being investigated as potential future vaccines against leishmaniasis. The 'first-generation' vaccines, composed of killed parasites with or without adjuvant, have been derived using an empirical approach. The 'second-generation' vaccines have been genetically constructed, using a more rational approach. At present, the first-generation vaccines are at various stages of Phase I (safety), II (reactivity) or III (efficacy) trials in humans. Results are expected in 1-2 years. The second-generation vaccines are, however, only in a preclinical state and are not expected to reach clinical trials for at least 3 years. The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) is actively involved in most clinical trials of the first-generation vaccines and supports many of the second-generation candidates. In the present article, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to vaccine development are discussed and the progress being made is briefly reviewed."
vaccines,"Objective: To estimate the efficacy and toxicity of typhoid fever vaccines. Design: Meta-analysis of randomised efficacy trials and both randomised and non-randomised toxicity studies of the parenteral whole cell, oral Ty21a, and parenteral Vi vaccines. Subjects: 1 866 951 subjects in 17 efficacy trials; 11 204 subjects in 20 toxicity studies. Main outcome measures: Pooled estimates of three year cumulative efficacy, year specific efficacy, and incidence of adverse events. Results: Three year cumulative efficacy was 73% (95% confidence interval 65% to 80%) for two doses of whole cell vaccines (based on seven trials); 51% (35% to 63%) for three doses of Ty21a vaccine (four trials); and 55% (30% to 71%) for one dose of Vi vaccine (one trial). For whole cell and Ty21a vaccines, regimens of fewer doses were less effective. Efficacy was shown to be significant for five years for whole cell vaccines, four years for Ty21a vaccine, and two years for Vi vaccine. Neither the age of vaccine recipient nor the incidence of typhoid fever in the control group (varying from 6 to 810 cases per 100 000 person years) affected the efficacy of the whole cell or Ty21a vaccines. After vaccination, fever occurred in 15.7% (11.5% to 21.2%) of whole cell vaccine recipients, 2.0% (0.7% to 5.3%) of Ty21a vaccine recipients, and 1.1% (0.1% to 12.3%) of Vi vaccine recipients. Conclusions: Whole cell vaccines are more effective than the Ty21a and Vi vaccines but are more frequently associated with adverse events. Whether the added efficacy of the whole cell vaccines outweighs their toxicity will depend on the setting in which vaccination is used. Key messages Typhoid fever is an important public health problem in the developing world, but the efficacy of currently available vaccines has remained uncertain This meta-analysis of 17 vaccine efficacy trials and 20 toxicity studies of the whole cell, Ty21a, and Vi typhoid vaccines showed that whole cell vaccines probably offer the greatest protection for the longest time These vaccines, however, were associated with higher toxicity than the Ty21a and Vi vaccines The decision about whether to vaccinate against typhoid fever—and which vaccine to use—depends on the individual setting Efficacy trials of vaccines should use standardised trial designs and methods of reporting"
vaccines,"Most vaccines should be given via the intramuscular route into the deltoid or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. This optimises the immunogenicity of the vaccine and minimises adverse reactions at the injection site. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of administering vaccines correctly.1–3 Clinical practice needs to reflect considerations about the right length and gauge of needles used to ensure that those vaccinated get the immunological benefit of the vaccines without local side effects.

Injecting a vaccine into the layer of subcutaneous fat, where poor vascularity may result in slow mobilisation and processing of antigen, is a cause of vaccine failure1—for example in hepatitis B,2 rabies, and influenza vaccines.3 Compared with intramuscular administration, subcutaneous injection of hepatitis B vaccine leads to significantly lower seroconversion rates and more rapid decay of antibody response.1

vaccines,"Group A and group C meningoccal polysaccharide vaccines were evaluated in infants. No significant local or systemic reactions were observed with 908 doses of vaccine given to 396 infants between 3 and 12 mo of age. The antibody response varied with the age of the infant, vaccine dose, molecular weight of vaccine, prior immunization with vaccine, and prior exposure to naturally occurring cross-reactive antigens. Only 7% of 3-mo-old infants had detectable antibody responses to primary immunization with 5-200 mug of A vaccine, presumably because of suppressive effects of high concentrations of maternal anti-A. More than 90% of 7- and 12-mo-old infants responded to A vaccine, achieving geometric mean anti-A concentrations of 0.38 and 0.98 mug/ml, respectively. The dose-response curve was flat between 10 and 200 mug of A vaccine. Geometric mean anti-A concentrations of 2.51 and 4.00 mug/ml were induced in 7- and 12-mo-old infants by booster injections of A vaccine. Approximately 90% of 3-mo-old infants had detectable antibody responses to primary immunization with C vaccine. The 100-mug dose appeared to be optimal, resulting in geometric mean anti-C concentrations of 0.49, 1.55, and 2.64 mug/ml in 3-, 7-, and 12-mo-old infants, respectively. Significant booster responses were not observed with C vaccine. Indeed, except for the 10-mug dose, booster injections of C vaccine in 7- and 12-mo-old infants resulted in lower anti-C concentrations than did primary immunizations."
vaccines,"SUMMARY Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) in infants and children worldwide and causes significant LRI in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients. The goal of RSV vaccination is to prevent serious RSV-associated LRI. There are several obstacles to the development of successful RSV vaccines, including the need to immunize very young infants, who may respond inadequately to vaccination; the existence of two antigenically distinct RSV groups, A and B; and the history of disease enhancement following administration of a formalin-inactivated vaccine. It is likely that more than one type of vaccine will be needed to prevent RSV LRI in the various populations at risk. Although vector delivery systems, synthetic peptide, and immune-stimulating complex vaccines have been evaluated in animal models, only the purified F protein (PFP) subunit vaccines and live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in recent clinical trials. PFP-2 appears to be a promising vaccine for the elderly and for RSV-seropositive children with underlying pulmonary disease, whereas live cold-passaged (cp), temperature-sensitive (ts) RSV vaccines (denoted cpts vaccines) would most probably be useful in young infants. The availability of cDNA technology should allow further refinement of existing live attenuated cpts candidate vaccines to produce engineered vaccines that are satisfactorily attenuated, immunogenic, and phenotypically stable."
vaccines,"Ticks are economically important ectoparasites of domestic and wild animals and are considered to be second worldwide to mosquitoes as vectors of human pathogens. Current control methods for ticks, based primarily on the use of acaricides, have had limited efficacy in the reduction of tick infestations and the use of acaricides is often accompanied by serious drawbacks, including selection of acaricide-resistant ticks and environmental contamination. Development of improved vaccines against tick infestations offers a cost-effective and environmentally sound control method. Commercial vaccines currently marketed for control of cattle ticks have been effective in field studies when used in concert with integrated control strategies. However, new antigens are needed to increase the efficacy of tick vaccines. Although a limited number of protective antigens against tick infestations have been identified and characterized, discovery of new antigens remains the limiting step for improving the efficacy of tick vaccines. Recent technologies developed for gene discovery, including expression library immunization and evaluation of expressed sequence tags, show promise for rapid, systematic and global antigen screening and should provide a comprehensive approach to selection of candidate vaccine antigens. Design of future tick vaccines should target multiple tick species, as well as interfere with the transmission of pathogens."
vaccines,"Malaria, tuberculosis, and the strains of HIV common in Africa kill approximately five million people each year. Yet research on vaccines for these diseases remains minimal-largely because potential vaccine developers fear that they would not be able to sell enough vaccine at a sufficient price to recoup their research expenditures. Enhancing markets for new vaccines could create incentives for vaccine research and increase accessibility of any vaccines developed. For example, the President of the World Bank has proposed establishing a fund to help developing countries finance purchases of specified vaccines if they are invented. The U.S. administration's 2000 budget proposal includes a tax credit for new vaccines that would match each dollar of vaccine sales with a dollar of tax credits. This paper examines the rationale for such proposals. Private firms currently conduct little research on vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis, and the strains of HIV common in Africa. This is not only because these diseases primarily affect poor countries, but also because vaccines are subject to severe market failures. Once vaccine developers have invested in developing vaccines, governments are tempted to use their powers as regulators, major purchasers, and arbiters of intellectual property rights to force prices to levels that do not cover research costs. Research on vaccines is an international public good, and none of the many small countries that would benefit from a malaria, tuberculosis, or HIV vaccine has an incentive to encourage research by unilaterally offering to pay higher prices. In fact, most vaccines sold in developing countries are priced at pennies per dose, a tiny fraction of their social value. More expensive, on-patent vaccines are typically not purchased by the poorest countries. Hence, private developers lack incentives to pursue socially valuable research opportunities. Large public purchases could potentially enlarge the market for vaccines, benefiting both vaccine producers and the public at large. Government-directed research programs may be well suited for basic research, but for the later, more applied stages of research, committing to compensate successful private vaccine developers has important advantages. Under such programs, the public pays only if a successful vaccine is actually developed. This gives pharmaceutical firms and scientists strong incentives to self-select research projects that have a reasonable chance of leading to a vaccine, and to focus on developing a viable vaccine rather than pursuing other goals. Committing to purchase vaccines and make them available to poor countries may be attractive relative to other ways of rewarding vaccine developers. Extending patents on other pharmaceuticals to reward developers of new vaccines would place the entire burden of financing vaccines on those needing these other pharmaceuticals. Increasing prices for current vaccines without explicit incentives for development of new vaccines would be insufficient to spur new research."
vaccines,"The literature on the protection imparted by conventional whole-cell pertussis vaccines was reviewed, and the extent to which the great variation in estimates of vaccine efficacy is attributable to methodologic problems in study design and analysis or to biologic features of the natural history of pertussis was explored. The protection against disease imparted by pertussis vaccines may be greater than that against infection. Estimates of vaccine efficacy from case-control studies are higher than those from studies of household secondary-attack rates; likewise, estimates of efficacy are higher when based on clinically severe or bacteriologically positive cases rather than simply on notified cases. Some of the reported differences in protection by different vaccines may be attributable to relations between the antigenic composition of the vaccine used and that of the circulating strain of Bordetella pertussis. Failure to consider age trends has sometimes led to spuriously high estimates of efficacy. Many biases can affect efficacy studies, and it is usually difficult to assess whether the net effect has been to underestimate or to overestimate ""true"" efficacy. The immunity imparted by conventional pertussis vaccines may be neither as solid nor as stable as that imparted by many live-virus vaccines. These issues must be considered during the evaluation of acellular pertussis vaccines."
vaccines,"Live attenuated and killed whole cell vaccines against disease caused by Yersinia pestis have been available since the early part of the last century. Although these vaccines indicate the feasibility of protecting against disease, they have a number of shortcomings. The live attenuated vaccine is highly reactogenic and is not licensed for use in humans. The killed whole cell vaccine, also reactogenic, provides poor protection against pneumonic plague and immunisation requires mutiple doses of the vaccine. Against this background, a range of candidate vaccines, including rationally attenuated mutants, subunit vaccines and naked DNA vaccines have been described. Of these, an injected subunit vaccine is likely to offer the best near-term solution to the provision of a vaccine that protects against both bubonic and pneumonic plague."
vaccines,"DNA vaccines are based on the transfer of genetic material, encoding an antigen, to the cells of the vaccine recipient. Despite high expectations of DNA vaccines as a result of promising preclinical data their clinical utility remains unproven. However, much data is gathered in preclinical and clinical studies about the safety of DNA vaccines. Here we review current knowledge about the safety of DNA vaccines. Safety concerns of DNA vaccines relate to genetic, immunologic, toxic, and environmental effects. In this review we provide an overview of findings related to the safety of DNA vaccines, obtained so far. We conclude that the potential risks of DNA vaccines are minimal. However, their safety issues may differ case-by-case, and they should be treated accordingly."
vaccines,"Despite the profusion of promising new vaccines against illnesses prevalent in developing countries, uncertainties about the balance between costs and benefits of new vaccines have retarded their use in public health practice. Conventional prelicensure trials of vaccine protection exacerbate these uncertainties by focusing on measurement of vaccine efficacy--the performance of a vaccine under idealized conditions. Vaccine effectiveness trials provide a more pragmatic perspective by addressing the performance of a vaccine under the ordinary conditions of a public health program, by capturing direct as well as indirect effects of vaccination, and by comprehensively addressing outcomes of public health concern. The use of effectiveness trials should enable more rational triaging of new vaccines for developing countries and may accelerate the introduction of new vaccines into public health practice by resolving speculative debates about practical costs and benefits."
vaccines,"More than 70 bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi are serious human pathogens.1 Vaccines are available against some of these agents and are being developed against almost all the other bacteria and viruses and about half of the parasites. Table 1 lists infections for which there are now licensed vaccines and those for which a candidate vaccine has undergone a phase 3 clinical trial,2 indicating that a vaccine will probably be licensed within 5 to 10 years. Traditionally, attenuated vaccines were made by repeated passaging of the infectious agent in tissue culture or animal hosts until its virulence was greatly decreased but its . . ."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Background Medical students are among the group of frontline healthcare providers likely to be exposed to COVID-19 patients. It is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates in this group as soon as a vaccine is available. As future healthcare providers, they will be entrusted with providing vaccine recommendations and counseling vaccine-hesitant patients. Methods This project used self-report to assess vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among medical students towards the novel COVID-19 vaccine. Results Nearly all participants had positive attitudes towards vaccines and agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19; however, only 53% indicated they would participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and 23% were unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine immediately upon FDA approval. Students willing to immediately take the vaccine were more likely to trust public health experts, have fewer concerns about side effects and agree with vaccine mandates (P < 0.05). Concern for serious side effects was independently predictive of lower odds of intent to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR = 0.41, P = 0.01). Conclusion This is the first study to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US medical students and highlights the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine."
vaccines,"Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What is more, the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria calls for new approaches to prevent infections. Given these changes, established methods for the identification of new vaccine candidates are no longer sufficient to ensure global protection. Hence, new vaccine technologies able to achieve rapid development as well as large scale production are of pivotal importance. This review will discuss viral vector and nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and mRNA vaccines) as new approaches that might be able to tackle these challenges to global health."
vaccines,"A novel coronavirus, which has been designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan China and causes the highly infectious disease referred to as COVID-19. COVID-19 has now spread worldwide to become a global pandemic affecting over 24 million people as of August 26th, 2020 and claimed the life of more than 800,000 people worldwide. COVID-19 is asymptomatic for some individuals and for others it can cause symptoms ranging from flu-like to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and death. Although it is anticipated that an effective vaccine will be available to protect against COVID-19, at present the world is relying on social distancing and hygiene measures and repurposed drugs. There is a worldwide effort to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and, as of late August 2020, there are 30 vaccines in clinical trials with over 200 in various stages of development. This review will focus on the eight vaccine candidates that entered Phase 1 clinical trials in mid-May, including AstraZeneca/Oxford's AZD1222, Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccines, which are currently in advanced stages of vaccine development. In addition to reviewing the different stages of vaccine development, vaccine platforms and vaccine candidates, this review also discusses the biological and immunological basis required of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the importance of a collaborative international effort, the ethical implications of vaccine development, the efficacy needed for an immunogenic vaccine, vaccine coverage, the potential limitations and challenges of vaccine development. Although the demand for a vaccine far surpasses the production capacity, it will be beneficial to have a limited number of vaccines available for the more vulnerable population by the end of 2020 and for the rest of the global population by the end of 2021."
vaccines,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are being developed by many countries for the safety of their population. However, people of various nations have revealed hesitancy towards being vaccinated, citing reasons such as side effects, safety, a lack of trust in vaccine effectiveness, etc. This study aimed to explore the willingness of people in Japan to be vaccinated or not be vaccinated and the reasons for either decision. A sample of 1100 respondents was drawn from an internet research panel, and a questionnaire survey was administered to evaluate their willingness to be vaccinated by gender, age group, place of living, and underlying illness history. After using descriptive statistics and the chi-squared test to evaluate categorical variables, 65.7% of the participants indicated a willingness to be vaccinated; among them were older age groups, those in rural areas, and those with underlying medical conditions. In addition, males showed less hesitancy towards being vaccinated. Although selectivity bias exists, this study is the first to examine the willingness of Japanese people to be vaccinated. Since vaccine hesitancy and refusal ratio were found to be higher in Japan than in other countries, policy efforts are needed to make the country’s vaccination program viable."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Vaccine acceptance depends on public trust and confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines and immunization, the health system, healthcare professionals and the wider vaccine research community. This systematic review analyses the current breadth and depth of vaccine research literature that explicitly refers to the concept of trust within their stated aims or research questions. After duplicates were removed, 19,643 articles were screened by title and abstract. Of these 2,779 were screened by full text, 35 of which were included in the final analysis. These studies examined a range of trust relationships as they pertain to vaccination, including trust in healthcare professionals, the health system, the government, and friends and family members. Three studies examined generalized trust. Findings indicated that trust is often referred to implicitly (19/35), rather than explicitly examined in the context of a formal definition or discussion of the existing literature on trust in a health context. Within the quantitative research analysed, trust was commonly measured with a single-item measure (9/25). Only two studies used validated multi-item measures of trust. Three studies examined changes in trust, either following an intervention or over the course of a pandemic. The findings of this review indicate a disconnect between the current vaccine hesitancy research and the wider health-related trust literature, a dearth in research on trust in low and middle-income settings, a need for studies on how trust levels change over time and investigations on how resilience to trust-eroding information can be built into a trustworthy health system."
vaccines,"
 An attenuated USSR vaccine culture of P. tularensis was examined for dissociation and found heterogeneous with regard to colony type morphology. Live BV, the more immunogenic of two variants isolated from the culture, proved effective for the protection of the mouse against s.c. challenge with strain SCHU S4; in contrast, killed cultures were not immunogenic. Guinea pigs vaccinated with live BV cells and challenged with strain SCHU S4 exhibited an appreciably longer survival time than animals vaccinated with killed preparations but eventually they succumbed.
 Although SCHU S1-11, one of several colony type variants of reduced virulence isolated from strain SCHU S1, proved equally as immunogenic for the mouse as BV and afforded the guinea pig greater protection than BV, the relatively high residual virulence of this variant for the guinea pig precluded its use as a vaccine strain. Serial animal passage of BV permitted the isolation of a culture that was ultimately selected for the production of live vaccine. The culture was designated the live vaccine strain (LVS) and is currently being used for the production of lyophilized live vaccine for use in man.
 Strain SCHU S4 proved superior to strain 503 as a challenge strain for quantitating the protection afforded test animals administered live vaccines.
 Data on the immunogenicity and storage stability of lyophilized live tularemia vaccine produced from cells harvested from GCHA and more recently from MCPH proved sufficiently encouraging to have warranted an extension of this study to a systematic evaluation of the vaccine in the monkey and subsequently in man."
vaccines,"Background Vaccination is a cornerstone of the prevention of communicable infectious diseases; however, vaccines have traditionally met with public fear and hesitancy, and COVID-19 vaccines are no exception. Social media use has been demonstrated to play a role in the low acceptance of vaccines. Objective The aim of this study is to identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccine–related discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals. Methods Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2021. We used R software to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the keywords vaccination, vaccinations, vaccine, vaccines, immunization, vaccinate, and vaccinated. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling as well as sentiment and emotion analysis using the National Research Council of Canada Emotion Lexicon. Results Topic modeling of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840/1,499,421 tweets, 15.2%) was the most tweeted topic and remained a highly discussed topic during the majority of the period of our examination. Vaccine progress around the world became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020, when Russia approved the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and became the most discussed topic after the first week of January 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, the sentiment was increasingly positive in general. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, sadness, etc. The trust emotion reached its peak on November 9, 2020, when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90% effective. Conclusions Public COVID-19 vaccine–related discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the active news topics in mainstream media. The discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines compared with previous vaccines."
vaccines,"Most pathogens enter the body through mucosal surfaces. Mucosal immunization, a non-invasive needle-free route, often stimulates a mucosal immune response that is both effective against mucosal and systemic pathogens. The development of mucosally administered heat-stable vaccines with long shelf life would therefore significantly enhance immunization programs in developing countries by avoiding the need for a cold chain or systemic injections. Currently, recombinant vaccine carriers are being used for antigen delivery. Engineering Bacillus subtilis for use as a non-invasive and heat stable antigen delivery system has proven successful. Bacterial spores protected by multiple layers of protein are known to be robust and resistant to desiccation. Stable constructs have been created by integration into the bacterial chromosome of immunogens. The spore coat has been used as a vehicle for heterologous antigen presentation and protective immunization. Sublingual (SL) and intranasal (IN) routes have recently received attention as delivery routes for therapeutic drugs and vaccines and recent attempts by several investigators, including our group, to develop vaccines that can be delivered intranasally and sublingually have met with a lot of success. As discussed in this Review, the use of Bacillus subtilis to express antigens that can be administered either intranasally or sublingually is providing new insights in the area of mucosal vaccines. In our work, we evaluated the efficacy of SL and IN immunizations with B. subtilis engineered to express tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) in mice and piglets. These bacteria engineered to express heterologous antigen either on the spore surface or within the vegetative cell have been used for oral, IN and SL delivery of antigens. A Bacillus subtilis spore coat protein, CotC was used as a fusion partner to express the tetanus fragment C. B. subtilis spores known to be highly stable and safe are also easy to purify making this spore-based display system a potentially powerful approach for surface expression of antigens. These advances will help to accelerate the development and testing of new mucosal vaccines against many human and animal diseases."

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Stimulating an immune response against cancer with the use of vaccines remains a challenge. We hypothesized that combining a melanoma vaccine with interleukin-2, an immune activating agent, could improve outcomes. In a previous phase 2 study, patients with metastatic melanoma receiving high-dose interleukin-2 plus the gp100:209-217(210M) peptide vaccine had a higher rate of response than the rate that is expected among patients who are treated with interleukin-2 alone.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, phase 3 trial involving 185 patients at 21 centers. Eligibility criteria included stage IV or locally advanced stage III cutaneous melanoma, expression of HLA*A0201, an absence of brain metastases, and suitability for high-dose interleukin-2 therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-2 alone (720,000 IU per kilogram of body weight per dose) or gp100:209-217(210M) plus incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51) once per cycle, followed by interleukin-2. The primary end point was clinical response. Secondary end points included toxic effects and progression-free survival.


RESULTS
The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics and received a similar amount of interleukin-2 per cycle. The toxic effects were consistent with those expected with interleukin-2 therapy. The vaccine-interleukin-2 group, as compared with the interleukin-2-only group, had a significant improvement in centrally verified overall clinical response (16% vs. 6%, P=0.03), as well as longer progression-free survival (2.2 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 3.9 vs. 1.6 months; 95% CI, 1.5 to 1.8; P=0.008). The median overall survival was also longer in the vaccine-interleukin-2 group than in the interleukin-2-only group (17.8 months; 95% CI, 11.9 to 25.8 vs. 11.1 months; 95% CI, 8.7 to 16.3; P=0.06).


CONCLUSIONS
In patients with advanced melanoma, the response rate was higher and progression-free survival longer with vaccine and interleukin-2 than with interleukin-2 alone. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00019682.)."
vaccines,"GVAX® is a granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene-transfected tumor cell vaccine. Original work with GM-CSF as a recombinant DNA protein (Leukine) involved proliferative stimulation of macrophages and neutrophils for the purpose of reducing hematopoietic toxicity related to dose-intensive chemotherapy. Following US Food and Drug Administration approval of Leukine several years ago, extensive preclinical results have demonstrated an immunostimulatory effect related to GM-CSF gene when transfected into tumor cells and used as a vaccine (GVAX). Tumor regression and prolonged survival was demonstrated in animal models. Toxicology with GVAX indicated no adverse effects, which enabled further testing in cancer patients. A small number of responses were demonstrated in Phase I trials in immunosensitive cancer patients (renal cell carcinoma and melanoma). However, a series of dramatic complete and durable responses in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients, demonstrated in recent clinical trials, have generated interest in further development of this vaccine in nontraditional cancer disease types. The rationale of GVAX development and a summary of clinical results are reviewed."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 reduced episodes of both clinical and severe malaria in children 5 to 17 months of age by approximately 50% in an ongoing phase 3 trial. We studied infants 6 to 12 weeks of age recruited for the same trial.


METHODS
We administered RTS,S/AS01 or a comparator vaccine to 6537 infants who were 6 to 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination in conjunction with Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines in a three-dose monthly schedule. Vaccine efficacy against the first or only episode of clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination, a coprimary end point, was analyzed with the use of Cox regression. Vaccine efficacy against all malaria episodes, vaccine efficacy against severe malaria, safety, and immunogenicity were also assessed.


RESULTS
The incidence of the first or only episode of clinical malaria in the intention-to-treat population during the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine was 0.31 per person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 0.40 per person-year in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 30.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.6 to 36.1). Vaccine efficacy in the per-protocol population was 31.3% (97.5% CI, 23.6 to 38.3). Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was 26.0% (95% CI, -7.4 to 48.6) in the intention-to-treat population and 36.6% (95% CI, 4.6 to 57.7) in the per-protocol population. Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups. One month after administration of the third dose of RTS,S/AS01, 99.7% of children were positive for anti-circumsporozoite antibodies, with a geometric mean titer of 209 EU per milliliter (95% CI, 197 to 222).


CONCLUSIONS
The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine coadministered with EPI vaccines provided modest protection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative; RTS,S ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00866619.)."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Antibody to influenza virus hemagglutinin has been traditionally associated with protection. Questions have been raised about its use as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy, particularly with regard to an absolute titer indicating seroprotection.


METHODS
We examined hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers in subjects from a placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated vaccines and compared titers in subjects with symptomatic influenza (cases) to those without influenza infection (noncases).


RESULTS
Prevaccination and postvaccination geometric mean titers were both significantly lower for cases compared with noncases in all intervention groups. Frequency of postvaccination seroconversion did not significantly differ for cases and noncases in either vaccine group. Among live attenuated vaccine and placebo recipients, cases were less likely than noncases to have postvaccination HAI titers ≥32 or 64. Nearly all recipients of inactivated vaccine had postvaccination titers of at least 64, and the small number of vaccine failures were scattered across titers ranging from 64 to 2048.


CONCLUSIONS
While HAI antibody is the major correlate of protection, postvaccination titers alone should not be used as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy. Vaccine failures from clinical trials need to be examined to determine why seemingly protective HAI titers may not protect. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00538512."
vaccines,"Vaccination with irradiated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting gene-transduced cancer vaccines induces tumoricidal immune responses. In a Phase I human gene therapy trial, eight immunocompetent prostate cancer (PCA) patients were treated with autologous, GM-CSF-secreting, irradiated tumor vaccines prepared from ex vivo retroviral transduction of surgically harvested cells. Expansion of primary cultures of autologous vaccine cells was successful to meet trial specifications in 8 of 11 cases (73%); the yields of the primary culture cell limited the number of courses of vaccination. Side effects were pruritus, erythema, and swelling at vaccination sites. Vaccine site biopsies manifested infiltrates of dendritic cells and macrophages among prostate tumor vaccine cells. Vaccination activated new T-cell and B-cell immune responses against PCA antigens. T-cell responses, evaluated by assessing delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions against untransduced autologous tumor cells, were evident in two of eight patients before vaccination and in seven of eight patients after treatment. Reactive DTH site biopsies manifested infiltrates of effector cells consisting of CD45RO+ T-cells, and degranulating eosinophils consistent with activation of both Th1 and Th2 T-cell responses. A distinctive eosinophilic vasculitis was evident near autologous tumor cells at vaccine sites, and at DTH sites. B-cell responses were also induced. Sera from three of eight vaccinated men contained new antibodies recognizing polypeptides of 26, 31, and 150 kDa in protein extracts from prostate cells. The 150-kDa polypeptide was expressed by LNCaP and PC-3 PCA cells, as well as by normal prostate epithelial cells, but not by prostate stromal cells. No antibodies against prostate-specific antigen were detected. These data suggest that both T-cell and B-cell immune responses to human PCA can be generated by treatment with irradiated, GM-CSF gene-transduced PCA vaccines."
vaccines,"Abstract Ticks are important ectoparasites of domestic and wild animals, and tick infestations economically impact cattle production worldwide. Control of cattle tick infestations has been primarily by application of acaricides which has resulted in selection of resistant ticks and environmental pollution. Herein we discuss data from tick vaccine application in Australia, Cuba, Mexico and other Latin American countries. Commercial tick vaccines for cattle based on the Boophilus microplus Bm86 gut antigen have proven to be a feasible tick control method that offers a cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternative to the use of acaricides. Commercial tick vaccines reduced tick infestations on cattle and the intensity of acaricide usage, as well as increasing animal production and reducing transmission of some tick-borne pathogens. Although commercialization of tick vaccines has been difficult owing to previous constraints of antigen discovery, the expense of testing vaccines in cattle, and company restructuring, the success of these vaccines over the past decade has clearly demonstrated their potential as an improved method of tick control for cattle. Development of improved vaccines in the future will be greatly enhanced by new and efficient molecular technologies for antigen discovery and the urgent need for a tick control method to reduce or replace the use of acaricides, especially in regions where extensive tick resistance has occurred."
vaccines,"The recent epidemics of pertussis (whooping cough) in parts of the USA and Australia have led to the largest numbers of annual cases reported in over half a century. These epidemics demonstrated a new pattern, with particularly high rates of disease among pre-adolescents and early adolescents. These high rates of pertussis coincided with the first cohorts vaccinated with purely acellular pertussis vaccine, which replaced whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccine in the later 1990s in the USA and Australia. Studies undertaken during these epidemics provide new evidence of more rapid waning of acellular pertussis-containing vaccines and longer-term protection from effective wP-containing vaccines. There is evidence that receiving wP as at least the first dose of pertussis-containing vaccine provides greater and more long-lived protection, irrespective of the nature of subsequent doses. This evidence will be reviewed together with the immunobiology associated with both vaccines, and the implications for pertussis control discussed."
vaccines,"Adjuvants improve host responsiveness to co-delivered vaccines through a variety of mechanisms. Agents that trigger cells expressing Toll-like receptors (TLR) activate an innate immune response that enhances the induction of vaccine-specific immunity. When administered in combination with vaccines designed to prevent or slow tumor growth, TLR agonists have significantly improved the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Unfortunately, vaccines containing TLR agonists have rarely been able to eliminate large established tumors when administered systemically. To improve efficacy, attention has focused on delivering TLR agonists intra-tumorally with the intent of altering the tumor microenvironment. Agonists targeting TLRs 7/8 or 9 can reduce the frequency of Tregs while causing immunosuppressive MDSC in the tumor bed to differentiate into tumoricidal macrophages thereby enhancing tumor elimination. This work reviews pre-clinical and clinical studies concerning the utility of TLR 7/8/9 agonists as adjuvants for tumor vaccines."
vaccines,"HPV-023 (NCT00518336; ClinicalTrial.gov) is a long-term follow-up of an initial double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled study (HPV-001, NCT00689741) evaluating the efficacy against human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 infection and associated cyto-histopathological abnormalities, persistence of immunogenicity, and safety of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine. Among the women, aged 15–25 years, enrolled in HPV-001 and who participated in the follow-up study HPV-007 (NCT00120848), a subset of 437 women from five Brazilian centers participated in this 36-month long-term follow-up (HPV-023) for a total of 113 months (9.4 years). During HPV-023, anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies were measured annually by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA). Cervical samples were tested for HPV DNA every 6 months, and cyto-pathological examinations were performed annually. During HPV-023, no new HPV-16/18-associated infections and cyto-histopathological abnormalities occurred in the vaccine group. Vaccine efficacy (VE) against HPV-16/18 incident infection was 100% (95%CI: 66.1, 100). Over the 113 months (9.4 years), VE was 95.6% (86.2, 99.1; 3/50 cases in vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) against incident infection, 100% (84·1, 100; 0/21) against 6-month persistent infection (PI); 100% (61·4, 100; 0/10) against 12-month PI; 97·1% (82.5, 99.9; 1/30) against ≥ ASC-US; 95·0% (68.0, 99.9; 1/18) against ≥ LSIL; 100% (45.2, 100; 0/8) against CIN1+; and 100% (–128.1, 100; 0/3) against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18. All vaccinees remained seropositive to HPV-16/18, with antibody titers remaining several folds above natural infection levels, as measured by ELISA and PBNA. There were no safety concerns. To date, these data represent the longest follow-up reported for a licensed HPV vaccine."
vaccines,"Background. The goal of the trial was to determine the efficacy of a multicomponent acellular pertussis vaccine against Bordetella illnesses in comparison with a whole-cell product and DT. Design. In a randomized, double-blind fashion, 2- to 4-month-old infants received 4 doses of either DTP or DTaP vaccine at 3, 4.5, 6, and 15 to 18 months of age. The controls received 3 doses (3, 4.5, 15 to 18 months of age) of DT vaccine. The DTP vaccine was Lederle adsorbed vaccine (licensed in the United States) and DTaP was Lederle/Takeda adsorbed vaccine. Follow-up for vaccine efficacy started 2 weeks after the third dose (DTP/DTaP) and at the same age (6.5 months) in DT recipients. Reactogenicity of all doses of all three vaccines was documented by standardized parent diary cards. In addition, all subjects were monitored for respiratory illnesses and serious adverse events by biweekly phone calls. Results. From May 1991 to January 1993, a total of 10 271 infants were enrolled: 8532 received either DTP or DTaP and 1739 received DT. Specific efficacy against B pertussisinfections with cough ≥7 days duration was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 76–88) and 72% (95% CI: 62–79) for DTP and DTaP, respectively; results for DTP and DTaP based on ≥21 days of cough with either paroxysms, whoop or posttussive vomiting (PWV) were 93% (95% CI: 89–96) and 83% (95% CI: 76–88), respectively. For DTaP vaccine, efficacy was higher after the fourth dose as compared with its efficacy after the third dose (78% vs 62% for cough ≥7 days and 85% vs 76% for cough ≥21 days with PWV). For DTP vaccine, efficacy was less varied after the third and fourth dose (78% vs 85% for cough ≥7 days and 93% vs 93% for cough ≥21 days with PWV). In contrast with DTP, the DTaP vaccine had some efficacy against B parapertussisinfection (point estimate for cough ≥7 days: 31% [95% CI: −10–56]). All vaccines were generally well-tolerated. However, side reactions were significantly less after DTaP compared with DTP. Conclusions. Like other multicomponent acellular pertussis vaccines, the Lederle/Takeda DTaP vaccine demonstrated good efficacy against mild and typical pertussis due to B pertussisinfections. Interestingly, it also may have some efficacy againstB parapertussis. Based on the results of this trial, the vaccine was licensed in the United States in December 1996 for all 5 doses of the currently recommended immunization schedule in this country."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Immunocompromised persons are at high risk of complications from influenza infection. This population includes those with solid organ transplants, hematopoietic stem cell transplants, solid cancers and hematologic malignancy as well as those with autoimmune conditions receiving biologic therapies. In this review, we discuss the impact of influenza infection and evidence for vaccine effectiveness and immunogenicity. Overall, lower respiratory disease from influenza is common; however, vaccine immunogenicity is low. Despite this, in some populations, influenza vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing severe disease. Various strategies to improve influenza vaccine immunogenicity have been attempted including two vaccine doses in the same influenza season, intradermal, adjuvanted, and high-dose vaccines. The timing of influenza vaccine is also important to achieve optimal immunogenicity. Given the suboptimal immunogenicity, family members and healthcare professionals involved in the care of these populations should be vaccinated. Health care professional recommendation for vaccination is an important factor in vaccine coverage."
vaccines,"Helminth parasites infect over one fourth of the human population and are highly prevalent in livestock worldwide. In model systems, parasites are strongly immunomodulatory, but the immune system can be driven to expel them by prior vaccination. However, no vaccines are currently available for human use. Recent advances in vaccination with recombinant helminth antigens have been successful against cestode infections of livestock and new vaccines are being tested against nematode parasites of animals. Numerous vaccine antigens are being defined for a wide range of helminth parasite species, but greater understanding is needed to define the mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity, to lay a rational platform for new vaccines and their optimal design. With human trials underway for hookworm and schistosomiasis vaccines, a greater integration between veterinary and human studies will highlight the common molecular and mechanistic pathways, and accelerate progress towards reducing the global health burden of helminth infection."
vaccines,"Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an infectious disease of the central nervous system caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic mosquito-borne flavivirus. JEV is prevalent in much of Asia and the Western Pacific, with over 4 billion people living at risk of infection. In the absence of antiviral intervention, vaccination is the only strategy to develop long-term sustainable protection against JEV infection. Over the past half-century, a mouse brain-derived inactivated vaccine has been used internationally for active immunization. To date, however, JEV is still a clinically important, emerging, and re-emerging human pathogen of global significance. In recent years, production of the mouse brain-derived vaccine has been discontinued, but 3 new cell culture-derived vaccines are available in various parts of the world. Here we review current aspects of JEV biology, summarize the 4 types of JEV vaccine, and discuss the potential of an infectious JEV cDNA technology for future vaccine development."
vaccines,"Vaccine-induced cellular immunity controls virus replication in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected monkeys only transiently, leading to the question of whether such vaccines for AIDS will be effective. We immunized monkeys with plasmid DNA and replication-defective adenoviral vectors encoding SIV proteins and then challenged them with pathogenic SIV. Although these monkeys demonstrated a reduction in viremia restricted to the early phase of SIV infection, they showed a prolonged survival. This survival was associated with preserved central memory CD4+ T lymphocytes and could be predicted by the magnitude of the vaccine-induced cellular immune response. These immune correlates of vaccine efficacy should guide the evaluation of AIDS vaccines in humans."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Vaccines are some of if not the most successful public health endeavors ever put into practice. Countless lives have been saved and the occurrences of vaccine preventable diseases are at a fraction of the rate experienced before vaccines. Vaccines and the realization of their compulsory scheduling are highly studied, safe, and purposeful. Despite these realities, there are an alarming number of parents who do not permit the vaccination of their children as scheduled. This is known in the health community as vaccine hesitancy and commonly portrayed in popular media as anti-vaccination sediment. This analysis opens with the topic as it was addressed during a September 2015 debate for the Republic Party's 2016 presidential nomination. Some key historical aspects of vaccine hesitancy are presented. This history leads to a description of the 2014–2015 measles outbreak in California. The factors that aide in the recruitment of under vaccination are then explored. Finally, select strategies to control, combat, and potentially attenuate vaccine hesitancy are presented."
vaccines,"The observer-blind, randomized, age-stratified, head-to-head study (NCT00423046) comparing immunogenicity and safety of HPV-16/18 and HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccines in healthy women aged 18-45 y was completed. Five y after vaccination, in subjects from the Month 60 according-to-protocol cohort (seronegative and DNA negative for HPV type analyzed at baseline), serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses induced by HPV-16/18 vaccine remained 7.8-fold (18-26-y stratum), 5.6-fold (27-35-y stratum) and 2.3-fold (36-45-y stratum) higher than those induced by HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine for HPV-16. For HPV-18, the fold differences were 12.1, 13.0 and 7.8, respectively. At Month 60, all (100%) subjects in HPV-16/18 vaccine group and the majority (95.7%-97.5%) in HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group were seropositive for HPV-16. For HPV-18, the majority (98.1%-100%) of subjects in HPV-16/18 vaccine group were seropositive; however, seropositivity rates in HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group decreased considerably (61.1%-76.9%) across the 3 age strata. In the total vaccinated cohort (received ≥ 1 dose regardless of baseline HPV serostatus and DNA status), geometric mean titers for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 nAb were higher in HPV-16/18 vaccine group than in HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine group. Based on the 5-y data, piece-wise and modified power-law models predicted a longer durability of nAb response for HPV-16/18 vaccine compared to HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. Beyond the differences apparent between the vaccines in terms of immunogenicity and modeled persistence of antibody responses, comparative studies including clinical endpoints would be needed to determine whether differences exist in duration of vaccine-induced protection."
vaccines,"In 2004, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) re-emerged from East Africa to cause devastating epidemics of debilitating and often chronic arthralgia that have affected millions of people in the Indian Ocean Basin and Asia. More limited epidemics initiated by travelers subsequently occurred in Italy and France, as well as human cases exported to most regions of the world, including the Americas where CHIKV could become endemic. Because CHIKV circulates during epidemics in an urban mosquito–human cycle, control of transmission relies on mosquito abatement, which is rarely effective. Furthermore, there is no antiviral treatment for CHIKV infection and no licensed vaccine to prevent disease. Here, we discuss the challenges to the development of a safe, effective and affordable chikungunya vaccine and recent progress toward this goal."
vaccines,"Immunization of volunteers by the bite of mosquitoes carrying radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites protects greater than 90% of such volunteers against malaria, if adequate numbers of immunizing biting sessions and sporozoite-infected mosquitoes are used. Nonetheless, until recently it was considered impossible to develop, license and commercialize a live, whole parasite P. falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine. In 2003 Sanaria scientists reappraised the potential impact of a metabolically active, non-replicating PfSPZ vaccine, and outlined the challenges to producing such a vaccine. Six years later, significant progress has been made in overcoming these challenges. This progress has enabled the manufacture and release of multiple clinical lots of a 1(st) generation metabolically active, non-replicating PfSPZ vaccine, the Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine, submission of a successful Investigational New Drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration, and initiation of safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy studies in volunteers in MD, US. Efforts are now focused on how best to achieve submission of a successful Biologics License Application and introduce the vaccine to the primary target population of African children in the shortest possible period of time. This will require implementation of a systematic, efficient clinical development plan. Short term challenges include optimizing the (1) efficiency and scale up of the manufacturing process and quality control assays, (2) dosage regimen and method of administration, (3) potency of the vaccine, and (4) logistics of delivering the vaccine to those who need it most, and finalizing the methods for vaccine stabilization and attenuation. A medium term goal is to design and build a facility for manufacturing highly potent and stable vaccine for pivotal Phase 3 studies and commercial launch."

 This paper describes the epidemiological techniques available for measuring vaccine efficacy and recommends a practical approach to their use. The efficacy of vaccines in clinical use can be determined by a variety of means, including screening, outbreak investigations, secondary attack rates in families or clusters, vaccine coverage assessment, and case-control studies. They all offer a means of monitoring vaccine programs under conditions of day-to-day vaccine use. A table summarizes the different techniques for measuring efficacy. The screening technique is the most useful and rapid means of determining whether there is a problem with a vaccine. All that is required is a reliable estimate of the proportion of cases occurring in vaccinated individuals and an estimate of the vaccine coverage in the population at risk. If the estimated efficacy is within expected limits, more detailed studies are not warranted. If the results suggest low efficacy, more rigorous methods are necessary to assess the efficacy more accurately. Of the more accurate methods available, outbreak investigation offers the simplest means of measuring vaccine efficacy and is the preferred technique if the situation permits. The biases inherent in the method can be minimized, particularly if the disease incidence rate is high during the outbreak and accurate records exist. In large populations, the underlying immunization status prior to the outbreak can be estimated using the same cluster sampling method used in coverage assessments. Calculation of secondary attack rates in families is also an excellent and accurate means of measuring vaccine efficacy and is an acceptable alternative to the outbreak investigation. Vaccine coverage methods in endemic areas are best suited to urban areas where the measles incidence rate is high after age 11 months and low before 12 months, and maternal histories of disease are thought to be accurate. Case-control studies are best suited to areas where reliable personal immunization records may be difficult to find but other information, such as clinic records, may be available. No epidemiological method is perfect because it cannot exactly duplicate the experimental conditions of a prospective randomized clinical trial. The most accurate results will be obtained when biases are anticipated and corrective measures are taken whenever possible. Clinical vaccine efficacy determinations are carried out in order to assess whether the observed pattern of illness is consistent with the proper use of a highly effective vaccine. The components of a vaccine efficacy evaluation -- case definition, case ascertainment, and vaccination status determination -- apply to studies on all vaccines.

vaccines,"With little or no evidence-based information to back up claims of vaccine danger, anti-vaccine activists have relied on the power of storytelling to infect an entire generation of parents with fear of and doubt about vaccines. These parent accounts of perceived vaccine injury, coupled with Andrew Wakefield’s fraudulent research study linking the MMR vaccine to autism, created a substantial amount of vaccine hesitancy in new parents, which manifests in both vaccine refusal and the adoption of delayed vaccine schedules. The tools used by the medical and public health communities to counteract the anti-vaccine movement include statistics, research, and other evidence-based information, often delivered verbally or in the form of the CDC’s Vaccine Information Statements. This approach may not be effective enough on its own to convince vaccine-hesitant parents that vaccines are safe, effective, and crucial to their children’s health. Utilizing some of the storytelling strategies used by the anti-vaccine movement, in addition to evidence-based vaccine information, could potentially offer providers, public health officials, and pro-vaccine parents an opportunity to mount a much stronger defense against anti-vaccine messaging."
vaccines,"Objective: Administration of a quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine to 16- to 26-year-old women was highly effective in preventing HPV-6/11/16/18-related cervical/vulvar/vaginal precancerous lesions and genital warts. As the risk of acquiring HPV significantly rises after sexual debut, HPV vaccines should have the greatest benefit in sexually naive adolescents. We evaluated the tolerability and immunogenicity of quadrivalent vaccine in males and females 9 to 15 years of age through 18 months postenrollment. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind trial, 1781 sexually naive children were assigned (2:1) to quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine or saline placebo administered at day 1 and months 2 and 6. Serum neutralizing anti-HPV-6/11/16/18 responses were summarized as geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates. Primary analyses were done per-protocol (subjects received 3 doses, had no major protocol violations and were HPV type-specific seronegative at day 1). Adverse experiences were collected by diary card. Results: At month 7, seroconversion rates were ≥99.5% for the 4 vaccine-HPV-types. GMTs and seroconversion rates in boys were noninferior to those in girls (P < 0.001). At month 18, ≥91.5% of vaccine recipients were seropositive, regardless of gender. A higher proportion of vaccine recipients (75.3%) than placebo recipients (50.0%) reported one or more injection-site adverse experiences following any vaccination. Rates of fever were similar between vaccination groups. No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were reported. Conclusions: In 9- to 15-year-old adolescents, the quadrivalent vaccine was generally well tolerated and induced persistent anti-HPV serologic responses in the majority of subjects for at least 12 months following completion of a three-dose regimen. The vaccine durability supports universal HPV vaccination programs in adolescents to reduce the burden of clinical HPV disease, particularly cervical cancer and precancers."
vaccines,"Glycoconjugate vaccines provide effective prophylaxis against bacterial infections. To date, however, no commercial vaccine has been available in which the key carbohydrate antigens are produced synthetically. We describe the large-scale synthesis, pharmaceutical development, and clinical evaluation of a conjugate vaccine composed of a synthetic capsular polysaccharide antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). The vaccine was evaluated in clinical trials in Cuba and showed long-term protective antibody titers that compared favorably to licensed products prepared with the Hib polysaccharide extracted from bacteria. This demonstrates that access to synthetic complex carbohydrate–based vaccines is feasible and provides a basis for further development of similar approaches for other human pathogens."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Addressing the drivers of vaccine hesitancy and the barriers to vaccine acceptance is a complex but important task. While the percentage of hesitant does vary from country to country and in time few, if any, countries are ever free from this problem. Overcoming hesitancy requires detection, diagnosis and tailored intervention as there is no simple strategy that can address all of the barriers to vaccine acceptance. Immunization program managers and health care workers need to become adept at recognizing and tackling hesitancy in all of its incarnations if high levels of vaccine acceptance are to be achieved but must also actively support immunization acceptors in order to build and support vaccine acceptance resiliency. This paper presents evidence-informed strategies to achieve these goals."
vaccines,"Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are now available and vaccination programs are being widely implemented, targeting adolescent girls prior to sexual debut. Since the risk of HPV exposure persists throughout a woman’s sexual life, the duration of protection provided by vaccination is critical to the overall vaccine effectiveness. We report the long-term efficacy and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (Cervarix®) up to 8.4 y after the first vaccine dose. In an initial placebo-controlled study performed in US, Canada and Brazil, women aged 15–25 y with normal cervical cytology, HPV-16/18 seronegative by ELISA, DNA-negative for 14 oncogenic HPV types by PCR, received either the HPV-16/18 vaccine or placebo (n = 1,113). Subjects were followed up to 6.4 y after the first dose (n = 776). We report an additional 2-y follow-up for women enrolled from the Brazilian centers from the initial study (n = 436). During the current follow-up study (HPV-023, NCT00518336), no new infection or lesions associated with HPV-16/18 occurred in the vaccine group. Vaccine efficacy over the entire follow-up (up to 8.4 y) was 95.1% (84.6, 99.0) for incident infection, 100% (79.8, 100) for 6-mo persistent infection, 100% (56.1, 100) for 12-mo persistent infection and 100% (< 0, 100) for CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18. All women in the vaccine group remained seropositive to both HPV-16/18, with antibody titers for total and neutralizing antibodies remaining several-folds above natural infection levels. The safety profile was clinically acceptable for both vaccine and control groups. This is, to date, the longest follow-up study for a licensed cervical cancer vaccine."
vaccines,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has failed to control the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, and there is a lack of safe and effective mucosal vaccines capable of potent protection against pulmonary TB. A recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral-based vaccine expressing an immunogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ag Ag85A (AdAg85A) was engineered and evaluated for its potential to be used as a respiratory mucosal TB vaccine in a murine model of pulmonary TB. A single intranasal, but not i.m., immunization with AdAg85A provided potent protection against airway Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge at an improved level over that by cutaneous BCG vaccination. Systemic priming with an Ag85A DNA vaccine and mucosal boosting with AdAg85A conferred a further enhanced immune protection which was remarkably better than BCG vaccination. Such superior protection triggered by AdAg85 mucosal immunization was correlated with much greater retention of Ag-specific T cells, particularly CD4 T cells, in the lung and was shown to be mediated by both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Thus, adenoviral TB vaccine represents a promising novel vaccine platform capable of potent mucosal immune protection against TB. Our study also lends strong evidence that respiratory mucosal vaccination is critically advantageous over systemic routes of vaccination against TB."
vaccines,"PROBLEM/CONDITION
Vaccines are usually administered to healthy persons who have substantial expectations for the safety of the vaccines. Adverse events after vaccinations occur but are generally rare. Some adverse events are unlikely to be detected in prelicensure clinical trials because of their low frequency, the limited numbers of enrolled subjects, and other study limitations. Therefore, postmarketing monitoring of adverse events after vaccinations is essential. The cornerstone of monitoring safety is review and analysis of spontaneously reported adverse events.


REPORTING PERIOD COVERED
This report summarizes the adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2001.


DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS
VAERS was established in 1990 under the joint administration of CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept reports of suspected adverse events after administration of any vaccine licensed in the United States. VAERS is a passive surveillance system: reports of events are voluntarily submitted by those who experience them, their caregivers, or others. Passive surveillance systems (e.g., VAERS) are subject to multiple limitations, including underreporting, reporting of temporal associations or unconfirmed diagnoses, and lack of denominator data and unbiased comparison groups. Because of these limitations, determining causal associations between vaccines and adverse events from VAERS reports is usually not possible. Vaccine safety concerns identified through adverse event monitoring nearly always require confirmation using an epidemiologic or other (e.g., laboratory) study. Reports may be submitted by anyone suspecting that an adverse event might have been caused by vaccination and are usually submitted by mail or fax. A web-based electronic reporting system has recently become available. Information from the reports is entered into the VAERS database, and new reports are analyzed weekly. VAERS data stripped of personal identifiers can be reviewed by the public by accessing http://www.vaers.org. The objectives of VAERS are to 1) detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events; 2) monitor increases in known adverse events; 3) determine patient risk factors for particular types of adverse events; 4) identify vaccine lots with increased numbers or types of reported adverse events; and 5) assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines.


RESULTS
During 1991-2001, VAERS received 128,717 reports, whereas >1.9 billion net doses of human vaccines were distributed. The overall dose-based reporting rate for the 27 frequently reported vaccine types was 11.4 reports per 100,000 net doses distributed. The proportions of reports in the age groups <1 year, 1-6 years, 7-17 years, 18-64 years, and >/= years were 18.1%, 26.7%, 8.0%, 32.6%, and 4.9%, respectively. In all of the adult age groups, a predominance among the number of women reporting was observed, but the difference in sex was minimal among children. Overall, the most commonly reported adverse event was fever, which appeared in 25.8% of all reports, followed by injection-site hypersensitivity (15.8%), rash (unspecified) (11.0%), injection-site edema (10.8%), and vasodilatation (10.8%). A total of 14.2% of all reports described serious adverse events, which by regulatory definition include death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or permanent disability. Examples of the uses of VAERS data for vaccine safety surveillance are included in this report.


INTERPRETATION
As a national public health surveillance system, VAERS is a key component in ensuring the safety of vaccines. VAERS data are used by CDC, FDA, and other organizations to monitor and study vaccine safety. CDC and FDA use VAERS data to respond to public inquiries regarding vaccine safety, and both organizations have published and presented vaccine safety studies based on VAERS data. VAERS data are also used by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee to evaluate possible adverse events after vaccinations and to develop recommendations for precautions and contraindications to vaccinations. Reviews of VAERS reports and the studies based on VAERS reports during 1991-2001 have demonstrated that vaccines are usually safe and that serious adverse events occur but are rare.


PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS
Through continued reporting of adverse events after vaccination to VAERS by health-care providers, public health professionals, and the public and monitoring of reported events by the VAERS working group, the public health system will continue to be able to detect rare but potentially serious consequences of vaccination. This knowledge facilitates improvement in the safety of vaccines and the vaccination process."
vaccines,"Nucleotide based vaccines represent an enticing, novel approach to vaccination. We have developed a novel immunization technology, RNActive® vaccines, that have two important characteristics: mRNA molecules are used whose protein expression capacity has been enhanced by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude by modifications of the nucleotide sequence with the naturally occurring nucleotides A (adenosine), G (guanosine), C (cytosine), U (uridine) that do not affect the primary amino acid sequence. Second, they are complexed with protamine and thus activate the immune system by involvement of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7. Essentially, this bestows self-adjuvant activity on RNActive® vaccines. RNActive® vaccines induce strong, balanced immune responses comprising humoral and cellular responses, effector and memory responses as well as activation of important subpopulations of immune cells, such as Th1 and Th2 cells. Pre-germinal center and germinal center B cells were detected in human patients upon vaccination. RNActive® vaccines successfully protect against lethal challenges with a variety of different influenza strains in preclinical models. Anti-tumor activity was observed preclinically under therapeutic as well as prophylactic conditions. Initial clinical experiences suggest that the preclinical immunogenicity of RNActive® could be successfully translated to humans."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. The licensed typhoid vaccines confer only about 70 percent immunity, do not protect young children, and are not used for routine vaccination. A newly devised conjugate of the capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi, Vi, bound to nontoxic recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (rEPA), has enhanced immunogenicity in adults and in children 5 to 14 years old and has elicited a booster response in children 2 to 4 years old.


METHODS
In a double-blind, randomized trial, we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the Vi-rEPA vaccine in children two to five years old in 16 communes in Dong Thap Province, Vietnam. Each of the 11,091 children received two injections six weeks apart of either Vi-rEPA or a saline placebo. Cases of typhoid, diagnosed by the isolation of S. typhi from blood cultures after 3 or more days of fever (a temperature of 37.5 degrees C or higher), were identified by active surveillance over a period of 27 months. We estimated efficacy by comparing the attack rate of typhoid in the vaccine group with that in the placebo group.


RESULTS
S. typhi was isolated from 4 of the 5525 children who were fully vaccinated with Vi-rEPA and from 47 of the 5566 children who received both injections of placebo (efficacy, 91.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 77.1 to 96.6; P<0.001). Among the 771 children who received only one injection, there was 1 case of typhoid in the vaccine group and 8 cases in the placebo group. Cases were distributed evenly among all age groups and throughout the study period. No serious adverse reactions were observed. In all 36 children studied four weeks after the second injection of the vaccine, levels of serum IgG Vi antibodies had increased by a factor of 10 or more.


CONCLUSIONS
The Vi-rEPA conjugate typhoid vaccine is safe and immunogenic and has more than 90 percent efficacy in children two to five years old. The antibody responses and the efficacy suggest that this vaccine should be at least as protective in persons who are more than five years old."
vaccines,"Recent studies have shown that the brain is not a barrier to successful active immunotherapy that uses gene-modified autologous tumor cell vaccines. In this study, we compared the efficacy of two types of vaccines for the treatment of tumors within the central nervous system (CNS): dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines pulsed with either tumor extract or tumor RNA, and cytokine gene–modified tumor vaccines. Using the B16/F10 murine melanoma (B16) as a model for CNS tumor, we show that vaccination with bone marrow–generated DCs, pulsed with either B16 cell extract or B16 total RNA, can induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes against B16 tumor cells. Both types of DC vaccines were able to protect animals from tumors located in the CNS. DC-based vaccines also led to prolonged survival in mice with tumors placed before the initiation of vaccine therapy. The DC-based vaccines were at least as effective, if not more so, as vaccines containing B16 tumor cells in which the granulocytic macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene had been modified. These data support the use of DC-based vaccines for the treatment of patients with CNS tumors."
vaccines,"Purpose: Many patients with clinically localized prostate cancer develop biochemical failure despite excellent local therapy perhaps due to occult metastatic disease. One potential solution is the utilization of a well-tolerated systemic therapy (e.g., vaccine) in concert with local therapy. Experimental Design: We present a randomized phase II clinical trial designed to determine if a poxviral vaccine encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can induce a PSA-specific T-cell response when combined with radiotherapy in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Thirty patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio into vaccine plus radiotherapy or radiotherapy-only arms. Those patients in the combination arm received a “priming” vaccine with recombinant vaccinia (rV) PSA plus r V containing the T-cell costimulatory molecule B7.1 (rV-B7.1) followed by monthly booster vaccines with recombinant fowlpox PSA. The vaccines were given with local granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and low-dose systemic interleukin-2. Standard external beam radiation therapy was given between the fourth and the sixth vaccinations. Results: Seventeen of 19 patients in the combination arm completed all eight vaccinations and 13 of these 17 patients had increases in PSA-specific T cells of at least 3-fold versus no detectable increases in the radiotherapy-only arm (P < 0.0005). There was also evidence of de novo generation of T cells to well-described prostate-associated antigens not found in the vaccine, providing indirect evidence of immune-mediated tumor killing. The vaccine was well tolerated. Conclusion: This vaccine regimen can be safely given in patients undergoing radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer, with the majority of patients generating a PSA-specific cellular immune response to vaccine."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The loss of half the U.S. supply of influenza vaccine due to contamination has created a critical shortage. Dose-sparing strategies that use intradermal delivery of vaccines may be one approach to consider.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, open-label trial outside the influenza season in 100 healthy adults 18 to 40 years of age to compare the immunogenicity and safety of intradermal immunization with influenza vaccine with standard intramuscular immunization. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a single intramuscular dose of 0.5 ml of trivalent influenza vaccine, containing at least 15 microg of hemagglutinin per strain, by means of a prefilled syringe or a single intradermal dose of 0.1 ml, containing at least 3 microg of hemagglutinin per strain, by means of a fine-gauge needle; both injections were in the deltoid region. Changes in the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titer were assessed by comparing geometric mean titers and fold increases relative to baseline values and by comparing changes in the seroconversion and seroprotection rates. Local and systemic adverse events were assessed after both types of vaccination.


RESULTS
Subjects who received an intradermal injection with one fifth the standard dose of influenza vaccine had increases in the geometric mean HAI titer by a factor of 15.2 for the H1N1 strain in the vaccine, 19.0 for the H3N2 strain, and 12.4 for the B strain on day 21, as compared with respective increases by a factor of 14.9, 7.1, and 15.3 for the intramuscular injection of the standard dose. Seroconversion and seroprotection rates were similar in the two groups on day 21, ranging from 66 to 82 percent and 84 to 100 percent, respectively. Local reactions were significantly more frequent among recipients of intradermal injections than among recipients of intramuscular injections, but such reactions were mild and transient.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study of young adults, intradermal administration of one fifth the standard intramuscular dose of an influenza vaccine elicited immunogenicity that was similar to or better than that elicited by intramuscular injection. Intradermal administration could be used to expand the supplies of influenza vaccine, but further studies are needed before this strategy can be recommended for routine use."
vaccines,"Virus-like particles (VLPs) consist of viral structural proteins that, when overexpressed, spontaneously self-assemble into particles that are antigenically indistinguishable from infectious virus or subviral particles. VLPs can be considered as dense, repetitive arrays of one or more protein subunits with properties that are highly advantageous for use as stand-alone vaccines or as vaccine platforms. This review discusses the development of VLP-based platform technologies for vaccines against pathogens, as well as nontraditional targets such as self-antigens involved in chronic diseases."
vaccines,"Use of the vaccine combinations varies somewhat between states, with two options (Pathways) available for immunisation at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age. Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory follow Pathway 1 which uses the DTPa-hepB combination with separate administration of Hib(PRP-OMP) and oral Sabin. Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania follow Pathway 2 which uses combination Hib(PRP-0MP)-hepB vaccine, with separate administration of DTPa and oral Sabin. Combination vaccines are used only in the primary vaccination schedule from 2 to 12 months of age. There are a number of new travel vaccines available, including cholera, yellow fever and typhoid vaccine."
vaccines,"Children 12-18 months old were randomized to receive one dose of a conjugate heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine, two doses of the same vaccine, or one dose of a 23-valent native polysaccharide vaccine. Before immunization, pneumococci included in the conjugate vaccine were isolated from 24% of the children, and an antibiotic-resistant pneumococcus was isolated from 22% of the children. The vaccines had no effect on carriage of non-vaccine-type pneumococci. In contrast, there was a significant reduction in carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci 3 months after one dose and 1 month after a second dose of conjugate vaccine (from 25% to 9% and 7%, respectively; P < .001). No effect was seen after vaccination with the nonconjugate vaccine. One year after immunization, carriage of antibiotic-resistant vaccine-type pneumococci in children receiving conjugate vaccine was lower than that in children receiving the nonconjugate vaccine (4% vs. 14%, P = .042). Conjugate pneumococcal vaccines may reduce spread of pneumococci in the community."
vaccines,"Parental vaccine hesitancy is a growing problem affecting the health of children and the larger population. This article describes the evolution of the vaccine hesitancy movement and the individual, vaccine-specific and societal factors contributing to this phenomenon. In addition, potential strategies to mitigate the rising tide of parent vaccine reluctance and refusal are discussed."
vaccines,"Hantaviruses are emerging viruses which are hosted by small mammals. When transmitted to humans, they can cause two clinical syndromes, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The review compiles the current list of hantaviruses which are thought to be pathogenic in humans on the basis of molecular or at least serological evidence. Whereas induction of a neutralizing humoral immune response is considered to be protective against infection, the dual role of cellular immunity (protection versus immunopathogenicity) is discussed. For active immunisation, inactivated virus vaccines are licensed in certain Asian countries. Moreover, several classical and molecular vaccine approaches are in pre-clinical stages of development. The development of hantavirus vaccines is hampered by the lack of adequate animal models of hantavirus-associated disease. In addition to active immunization strategies, the review summarizes other ways of infection prevention, as passive immunization, chemoprophylaxis, and exposition prophylaxis."
vaccines,"DNA vaccination is a disruptive technology that offers the promise of a new rapidly deployed vaccination platform to treat human and animal disease with gene-based materials. Innovations such as electroporation, needle free jet delivery and lipid-based carriers increase transgene expression and immunogenicity through more effective gene delivery. This review summarizes complementary vector design innovations that, when combined with leading delivery platforms, further enhance DNA vaccine performance. These next generation vectors also address potential safety issues such as antibiotic selection, and increase plasmid manufacturing quality and yield in exemplary fermentation production processes. Application of optimized constructs in combination with improved delivery platforms tangibly improves the prospect of successful application of DNA vaccination as prophylactic vaccines for diverse human infectious disease targets or as therapeutic vaccines for cancer and allergy."
vaccines,"OBJECTIVES. Parents who have concerns about vaccine safety may be reluctant to have their children vaccinated. The purpose of this study was to explore how vaccination coverage among children 19 to 35 months of age is associated with health care providers' influence on parents' decision to vaccinate their children, and with parents' beliefs about vaccine safety. METHODS. Parents of 7695 children 19 to 35 months of age sampled by the National Immunization Survey were administered the National Immunization Survey Parental Knowledge Module between the third quarter of 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002. Health care providers were defined as a physician, nurse, or any other type of health care professional. Parents provided responses that summarized the degree to which they believed vaccines were safe, and the influence providers had on their decisions to vaccinate their children. Children were determined to be up-to-date if their vaccination providers reported administering ≥4 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, ≥3 doses of polio vaccine, ≥1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, ≥3 doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine. RESULTS. Of all of the parents, 5.7% thought that vaccines were not safe, and 21.5% said that their decision to vaccinate their children was not influenced by a health care provider. Compared with parents who responded that providers were not influential in their decision to vaccinate their children, parents who responded that providers were influential were twice as likely to respond that vaccines were safe for children. Among children whose parents believed that vaccines were not safe, those whose parents' decision to vaccinate was influenced by a health care provider had an estimated vaccination coverage rate that was significantly higher than the estimated coverage rate among children whose parents' decision was not influenced by a health care provider (74.4% vs 50.3%; estimated difference: 24.1%). CONCLUSIONS. Health care providers have a positive influence on parents to vaccinate their children, including parents who believe that vaccinations are unsafe. Physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals should increase their efforts to build honest and respectful relationships with parents, especially when parents express concerns about vaccine safety or have misconceptions about the benefits and risks of vaccinations."
vaccines,"Adjuvants are essential components of most clinically used vaccines. This is because the majority of nonliving vaccines are relatively poor inducers of adaptive immunity unless effective adjuvants are co-administered. Aluminum salts (alum) have been used as adjuvants with great success for almost a century and have been particularly effective at promoting protective humoral immunity. However, alum is not optimally effective for diseases where cell-mediated immunity is required for protection. Furthermore, adjuvants including oil-in-water emulsions have shown improved efficacy for avian influenza protection suggesting that even for diseases where humoral immunity can confer protection, there is scope for developing improved adjuvants. There have been major developments in antigen discovery over the past decade, which has accelerated the vaccine development process for new indications and this demands a new generation of adjuvants that can drive and specifically direct the desired immune responses. A number of systems are under investigation that combine different types of adjuvants into specific formulations with greater activity. Additionally, targeting of vaccines to specific immune cells shows great promise. In the case of cancer and chronic infectious diseases, it may be difficult to develop effective vaccines without blocking immune regulatory pathways, which impede cell-mediated responses. However, increased understanding of immunology and particularly the innate immune system is informing vaccine adjuvant research and consequently driving the development of novel and specifically directed vaccine adjuvant strategies. In this article we address the importance of adjuvants in vaccine development, the known mode of action of specific adjuvants and recent developments in this important field."
vaccines,"The RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine candidate has recently entered phase 3 testing. Reaching this important milestone is the culmination of more than 20 years of research and development by GlaxoSmithKline and partners and collaborators. The vaccine has been developed to protect young children and infants living in sub-Saharan Africa against clinical and severe disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. Over the past 9 years, RTS,S/AS candidate vaccine has been evaluated in multiple Phase 2 studies. The vaccine was shown to have a favourable safety profile and to be well tolerated in all age groups in which it was tested, including the intended target population of infants and young children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Data obtained so far suggest that RTS,S/AS can be co-administered with other vaccines included in the routine Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI). In Phase 2 testing, the vaccine candidate was shown to confer significant protection against P. falciparum infection and clinical disease, including severe malaria. Furthermore, a trend towards an indirect beneficial effect of the vaccine on non-malarial morbidities has been observed in several trials. In this paper, we will describe the genesis of the RTS,S/AS concept, including the rationale for selecting the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) as the target antigen. Early development history of the vaccine will be briefly described. We will present the most salient results from recent Phase 2 studies conducted in the target pediatric population, which have led to the decision to progress RTS,S/AS to Phase 3 testing. If the Phase 3 results confirm the observations made during Phase 2 testing, the RTS,S/AS vaccine, when broadly implemented and judiciously integrated with other malaria-prevention measures, would have a major public-health impact in Sub-Saharan Africa."
vaccines,"Abstract Objective: To examine the association between routine childhood vaccinations and survival among infants in Guinea-Bissau. Design: Follow up study. Participants: 15 351 women and their children born during 1990 and 1996. Setting: Rural Guinea-Bissau. Main outcome measures: Infant mortality over six months (between age 0-6 months and 7-13 months for BCG, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, and polio vaccines and between 7-13 months and 14-20 months for measles vaccine). Results: Mortality was lower in the group vaccinated with any vaccine compared with those not vaccinated, the mortality ratio being 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 1.03). After cluster, age, and other vaccines were adjusted for, BCG was associated with significantly lower mortality (0.55 (0.36 to 0.85)). However, recipients of one dose of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis or polio vaccines had higher mortality than children who had received none of these vaccines (1.84 (1.10 to 3.10) for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis). Recipients of measles vaccine had a mortality ratio of 0.48 (0.27 to 0.87). When deaths from measles were excluded from the analysis the mortality ratio was 0.51 (0.28 to 0.95). Estimates were unchanged by controls for background factors. Conclusions: These trends are unlikely to be explained exclusively by selection biases since different vaccines were associated with opposite tendencies. Measles and BCG vaccines may have beneficial effects in addition to protection against measles and tuberculosis."
vaccines,This chapter analyzes the costs and cost-effectiveness of scaling up the EPI and introducing selected new vaccines into the program. It also summarizes the epidemiology of diseases preventable through immunization and estimates the disease burden with and without immunization programs. In addition the chapter discusses the organization delivery and financing of immunization programs and highlights future prospects and areas for further study. Several areas overlap with other chapters. For example the vaccines that prevent measles tuberculosis diphtheria pertussis Hib and Neisseria meningitis prevent respiratory diseases. Some vaccines such as those against measles and pertussis prevent diseases that cause or contribute to malnutrition. Chapter 16 provides an in-depth review of tuberculosis and a discussion of the potential impact of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines. This chapter also does not discuss some new vaccines including conjugate Streptococcus pneumoniae influenza typhoid fever and rotavirus because other chapters deal with those diseases and vaccines. Vaccines to prevent mumps and varicella that are routinely used in some developed countries are not included in most vaccination programs in developing countries. Other interventions that can reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases and are not covered in this chapter include clean umbilical cord care to reduce the incidence of neonatal tetanus vitamin A therapy to reduce the case-fatality rate (CFR) from measles and intensive clinical care that can reduce the mortality associated with most of the vaccine-preventable diseases.

vaccines,"As compared with peptide- or protein-based vaccines, naked DNA vectors and even traditional attenuated or inactivated virus vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs) are an attractive vaccine platform, as they offer a combination of safety, ease of production and both high-density B-cell epitope display and intracellular presentation of T-cell epitopes that induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses, respectively. Indeed, HPV vaccines based on VLP production by recombinant expression of major capsid antigen L1 in yeast (Gardasil®, Merck & Co., NJ, USA) or insect cells (Cervarix®, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) have been licensed for the prevention of cervical and anogenital infection and disease associated with the genotypes targeted by each vaccine. However, these HPV vaccines have not been demonstrated as effective to treat existing infections, and efforts to develop a therapeutic HPV vaccine continue. Furthermore, current HPV L1-VLP vaccines provide type-restricted protection, requiring highly multivalent formulations to broaden coverage to the dozen or more oncogenic HPV genotypes. This raises the complexity and cost of vaccine production. The lack of access to screening and high disease burden in developing countries has spurred efforts to develop second-generation HPV vaccines that are more affordable, induce wider protective coverage and offer therapeutic coverage against HPV-associated malignancies. Given the previous success with L1-VLP-based vaccines against HPV, VLPs have been also adopted as platforms for many second-generation HPV and non-HPV vaccine candidates with both prophylactic and therapeutic intent. In this article, the authors examine the progress and challenges of these efforts, with a focus on how they inform VLP vaccine design."
vaccines,"In preclinical studies, MF59 adjuvant offered improved protection against influenza virus challenge and significantly reduced the viral load in the lungs of challenged mice. In humans, MF59 is a safe and potent vaccine adjuvant that has been licensed in more than 20 countries (Fluad® [Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Inc., MA, USA]). The safety profile of an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine is well established through a large safety database. MF59 adjuvant has had a significant impact on the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in the elderly and in adults who are chronically ill. MF59 has also been shown to have a significant impact on the immunogenicity of pandemic influenza vaccines. MF59 allows for broader cross-reactivity against viral strains not included in the vaccine. MF59 has been shown to be more potent for both antibody and T-cell responses than aluminum-based adjuvants. MF59 has broad potential to be used as a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant for a wide range of vaccine types."
vaccines,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are under investigation, but little is known about attitudes regarding vaccination. The aims of this study were to identify attitudes about and intention to receive an HPV vaccine in young women using a theory-based model. Young women (n=52, mean age 25 years, range 18-30 years, 35% Black/Non-Hispanic) completed a survey assessing knowledge, attitudes about HPV vaccination, and risk behaviours. Associations between attitudes and intention to receive the vaccine were assessed using Mann-Whitney U or chi-square tests. Subjects reported positive attitudes about receiving an HPV vaccine and high intention to receive the vaccine both for themselves and their daughters. Variables associated significantly with intention included knowledge (P=0.004), personal beliefs about vaccination (P=0.004), belief that others would approve of vaccination (P=0.005), and higher number of sexual partners (P=0.028). Information on attitudes about HPV vaccination and predictors of intention to receive a vaccine may guide immunization initiatives for young adults."
vaccines,"In the case of an influenza pandemic, the current global influenza vaccine production capacity will be unable to meet the demand for billions of vaccine doses. The ongoing threat of an H5N1 pandemic therefore urges the development of highly immunogenic, dose-sparing vaccine formulations. In unprimed individuals, inactivated whole virus (WIV) vaccines are more immunogenic and induce protective antibody responses at a lower antigen dose than other formulations like split virus (SV) or subunit (SU) vaccines. The reason for this discrepancy in immunogenicity is a long-standing enigma. Here, we show that stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, in particular stimulation of TLR7, by H5N1 WIV vaccine is the prime determinant of the greater magnitude and Th1 polarization of the WIV-induced immune response, as compared to SV- or SU-induced responses. This TLR dependency largely explains the relative loss of immunogenicity in SV and SU vaccines. The natural pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognized by TLR7 is viral genomic ssRNA. Processing of whole virus particles into SV or SU vaccines destroys the integrity of the viral particle and leaves the viral RNA prone to degradation or involves its active removal. Our results show for a classic vaccine that the acquired immune response evoked by vaccination can be enhanced and steered by the innate immune system, which is triggered by interaction of an intrinsic vaccine component with a pattern recognition receptor (PRR). The insights presented here may be used to further improve the immune-stimulatory and dose-sparing properties of classic influenza vaccine formulations such as WIV, and will facilitate the development of new, even more powerful vaccines to face the next influenza pandemic."
vaccines,"In a previous study in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) hemodialysis patients, a single dose of Staphylococcus aureus type 5 and 8 capsular polysaccharides (T5/T8) conjugated to nontoxic recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A investigational vaccine showed no efficacy against S. aureus bacteremia 1 year post-vaccination, but a trend for efficacy was observed over the first 40 weeks post-vaccination. Vaccine efficacy (VE) of 2 vaccine doses was therefore evaluated. In a double-blind trial 3359 ESRD patients were randomized (1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo at week 0 and 35. VE in preventing S. aureus bacteremia was assessed between 3–35 weeks and 3–60 weeks post-dose-1. Anti-T5 and anti-T8 antibodies were measured. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded for 42 days post-vaccination and deaths until study end. No significant difference in the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia was observed between vaccine and placebo groups between weeks 3–35 weeks post-dose 1 (VE -23%, 95%CI: -98;23, p = 0.39) or at 3–60 weeks post-dose-1 (VE -8%, 95%CI: -57;26, p = 0.70). Day 42 geometric mean antibody concentrations were 272.4 μg/ml and 242.0 μg/ml (T5 and T8, respectively) in vaccinees. SAEs were reported by 24%/25.3% of vaccinees/placebo recipients. These data do not show a protective effect of either 1 or 2 vaccine doses against S. aureus bacteremia in ESRD patients. The vaccine induced a robust immune response and had an acceptable safety profile. Further investigation suggested possible suboptimal vaccine quality (manufacturing) and a need to expand the antigen composition of the vaccine. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00071214."
vaccines,"Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs act as immune adjuvants, accelerating and boosting antigen-specific antibody responses by up to 500-fold. CpG motifs promote the production of T-helper 1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce the maturation/activation of professional antigen-presenting cells (including macrophages and dendritic cells). These effects are optimized by maintaining close physical contact between the CpG DNA and the immunogen. Coadministering CpG DNA with a variety of vaccines has improved protective immunity in animal challenge models. Ongoing clinical studies indicate that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides are safe and well-tolerated when administered as adjuvants to humans and in some cases increase vaccine-induced immune responses."
vaccines,"The most important reasons cited by the opponents of vaccines are concerns about vaccine safety. Unlike issues such as autism for which no indisputable documentation of direct relationship with vaccine use is available, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an adverse event that can really follow vaccine administration, and may limit vaccine use because little is known about which vaccines it may follow, its real incidence and severity, the risk of chronic disease, or the possibility of recurrences after new doses of the same vaccine. The main aim of this review is to clarify the real importance of thrombocytopenia as an adverse event and discuss how it may interfere with recommended vaccination schedules. The available data clearly indicate that ITP is very rare and the only vaccine for which there is a demonstrated cause-effect relationship is the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine that can occur in 1 to 3 children every 100,000 vaccine doses. However, also in this case, the incidence of ITP is significantly lower than that observed during the natural diseases that the vaccine prevents. Consequently, ITP cannot be considered a problem limiting vaccine use except in the case of children suffering from chronic ITP who have to receive MMR vaccine. In these subjects, the risk-benefit ratio of the vaccine should be weighed against the risk of measles in the community."
vaccines,"Nucleic acid vaccines represent an attractive approach to generating antigen-specific immunity because of their stability and simplicity of delivery. However, there is still a need to increase the potency of DNA vaccines. Using human papillomavirus type 16 E7 as a model antigen, we evaluated the effect of linkage to Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) on the potency of antigen-specific immunity generated by naked DNA vaccines. We found that vaccines containing E7-HSP70 fusion genes increased the frequency of E7-specific CD8+ T cells by at least 30-fold relative to vaccines containing the wild-type E7 gene. More importantly, this fusion converted a less effective vaccine into one with significant potency against established E7-expressing tumors. Surprisingly, E7-HSP70 fusion vaccines exclusively targeted CD8+ T cells; immunological and antitumor effects were completely CD4-independent. These results indicate that fusion of HSP70 to an antigen gene may greatly enhance the potency of DNA vaccines via CD8-dependent pathways."
vaccines,"Vaccines save millions of lives every year. They are one of the safest and most effective public health interventions in keeping populations healthy while bringing numerous social and economic benefits. Vaccines play an important role in ensuring that children, regardless of where they live, can have a healthy start to life. New financing mechanisms that allow poorer countries to gain access to vaccines faster than ever mean additional deaths and disabilities are projected to be saved during the Decade of Vaccines (2011–2020). Trust in vaccines and in the health system is an important element of public health programs that aim to deliver life-saving vaccines. Indeed, understanding the contributors and threats to trust is essential to explaining vaccine acceptance, particularly as they vary across epidemiologic conditions, specific vaccines and cultural and sociopolitical settings. Greater efforts to communicate the benefits and risks of vaccines and address issues with evidence-based information will help improve and sustain public trust in vaccines and health systems worldwide. Measuring and monitoring trust levels and focusing on deliberate efforts to build trust in vaccines are important steps to reducing vaccine confidence gaps when they occur."
vaccines,"Although present conventional foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines can prevent clinical disease, protection is short lived (∼6 months), often requiring frequent revaccination for prophylactic control, and vaccination does not induce rapid protection against challenge or prevent the development of the carrier state. Furthermore, it is clear that the clinical protection depends upon the length of immunization and the duration of exposure/challenge methods. This review summarizes the present and future strategies for FMD control in endemic and FMD-free countries, the effectiveness of FMD vaccines in cattle, sheep and pigs, new methods for selecting vaccine strains, suggestions for alternative methods of vaccine testing, suggestions for the development of new-generation efficacious vaccines and their companion tests to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT The induction of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific T-cell responses is widely seen as critical to the development of effective immunity to HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Plasmid DNA and recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) vaccines are among the most promising safe HIV-1 vaccine candidates. However, the immunity induced by either vaccine alone may be insufficient to provide durable protection against HIV-1 infection. We evaluated a consecutive immunization strategy involving priming with DNA and boosting with rFPV vaccines encoding common HIV-1 antigens. In mice, this approach induced greater HIV-1-specific immunity than either vector alone and protected mice from challenge with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 antigens. In macaques, a dramatic boosting effect on DNA vaccine-primed HIV-1-specific helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, but a decline in HIV-1 antibody titers, was observed following rFPV immunization. The vaccine regimen protected macaques from an intravenous HIV-1 challenge, with the resistance most likely mediated by T-cell responses. These studies suggest a safe strategy for the enhanced generation of T-cell-mediated protective immunity to HIV-1."
vaccines,"CONTEXT
The duration of protection from tuberculosis of BCG vaccines is not known.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the long-term duration of protection of a BCG vaccine that was previously found to be efficacious.


DESIGN
Retrospective record review using Indian Health Service records, tuberculosis registries, death certificates, and supplemental interviews with trial participants.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
Follow-up for the period 1948-1998 among American Indians and Alaska Natives who participated in a placebo-controlled BCG vaccine trial during 1935-1938 and who were still at risk of developing tuberculosis. Data from 1483 participants in the BCG vaccine group and 1309 in the placebo group were analyzed.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Efficacy of BCG vaccine, calculated for each 10-year interval using a Cox regression model with time-dependent variables based on tuberculosis events occurring after December 31, 1947 (end of prospective case finding).


RESULTS
The overall incidence of tuberculosis was 66 and 138 cases per 100 000 person-years in the BCG vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, for an estimate of vaccine efficacy of 52% (95% confidence interval, 27%-69%). Adjustments for age at vaccination, tribe, subsequent BCG vaccination, chronic medical illness, isoniazid use, and bacille Calmette-Guérin strain did not substantially affect vaccine efficacy. There was slight but not statistically significant waning of the efficacy of BCG vaccination over time, greater among men than women.


CONCLUSION
In this trial, BCG vaccine efficacy persisted for 50 to 60 years, suggesting that a single dose of an effective BCG vaccine can have a long duration of protection."
vaccines,"The immaturity of the immune system increases the susceptibility of young infants to infectious diseases and prevents the induction of protective immune responses by vaccines. We previously reported that Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination induces a potent Th1 response to mycobacterial Ags in newborns. In this study, we evaluated the influence of BCG on the response to unrelated vaccines given in early life. Newborns were randomly allocated to one of three study groups receiving BCG at birth, when infants received their first dose of hepatitis B and oral polio vaccines; at 2 mo of age, when infants received their first dose of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines; or at 4.5 mo of age, when immune responses to vaccines were measured. Administration of BCG at the time of priming markedly increased the cellular and Ab responses to the hepatitis B vaccine, but had only a limited influence on the cytokine response to tetanus toxoid and no effect on the Ab responses to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Although BCG induced a potent Th1-type response to mycobacterial Ags, it promoted the production of both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines in response to unrelated vaccines. The effect of BCG was apparent at the systemic level, as it increased the Ab response to oral polio vaccine. These results demonstrate that BCG influences the immune response to unrelated Ags in early life, likely through its influence on the maturation of dendritic cells."
vaccines,"A live-attenuated, intranasal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) candidate vaccine, cpts-248/404, was tested in phase 1 trials in 114 children, including 37 1-2-month-old infants-a target age for RSV vaccines. The cpts-248/404 vaccine was infectious at 104 and 105 plaque-forming units in RSV-naive children and was broadly immunogenic in children >6 months old. Serum and nasal antibody responses in 1-2 month olds were restricted to IgA, had a dominant response to RSV G protein, and had no increase in neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, there was restricted virus shedding on challenge with a second vaccine dose and preliminary evidence for protection from symptomatic disease on natural reexposure. The cpts-248/404 vaccine candidate did not cause fever or lower respiratory tract illness. In the youngest infants, however, cpts-248/404 was unacceptable because of upper respiratory tract congestion associated with peak virus recovery. A live attenuated RSV vaccine for the youngest infant will use cpts-248/404 modified by additional attenuating mutations."
vaccines,"Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) disease remains a serious public health problem for which a cross-protective vaccine effective against a wide range of MenB isolates has not been available. Novartis Vaccines has developed a vaccine for the prevention of MenB disease that contains four antigenic components: factor H binding protein (fHbp), neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisseria heparin binding antigen (NHBA) and outer membrane vesicles from a New Zealand epidemic strain (which provides PorA). This vaccine has been submitted for regulatory review in Europe so it is timely to review the design of the vaccine, results to date in clinical studies and the potential strain coverage provided by the vaccine. It is also critical to discuss the key issues for the long-term success of the vaccine which include strain coverage, potential persistence of protection, potential effects on carriage of MenB strains, potential for escape mutants and cost effectiveness."
vaccines,"Group A meningococcal disease has been an important public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa for over a century. Outbreaks occur there annually, and large epidemics occur at intervals ranging between 8 and 12 y. The Meningitis Vaccine Project was established in 2001 with funding from the Gates Foundation with the goal of developing, testing, licensing, and introducing an affordable group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine into Africa. From 2003 to 2009 a monovalent group A conjugate vaccine, MenAfriVacTM, was developed at the Serum Institute of India, Ltd through an innovative public/private partnership. Preclinical studies of the new conjugate vaccine were completed in 2004 and a Phase 1 study began in India in 2005. Phase 2/3 studies in African 1–29 y olds were completed in 2009 showing the new meningococcal A conjugate vaccine to be as safe as currently licensed meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines, but much more immunogenic. After Indian market authorization (December 2009) and WHO prequalification (June 2010), MenAfriVacTM was introduced at public health scale using a single 10 µg dose in individuals 1–29 y of age in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger in December 2010. We summarize the laboratory and clinical studies leading to prequalification of MenAfriVacTM. The 2011 epidemic season ended with no reported case of group A meningitis in vaccinated individuals."
vaccines,"The live, attenuated yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine provides highly effective and durable immunity and is widely used for travelers to and residents of endemic areas of South America and Africa. Neurotropic and viscerotropic serious adverse events associated with these vaccines occur rarely, but YF 17D vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) is notable for its lethality. There appear to be two distinct patterns of risk for YEL-AVD: the first in younger persons, particularly women, with defects in innate immunity, in whom the case-fatality rate is higher; and the second in elderly persons, particularly men with age-related immune senescence and a lower case-fatality rate. From 1990 to the present, the number of cases (n = 31) and deaths (n = 12) from YEL-AVD in travelers has exceeded the reports of YF (n = 6) acquired by natural infection, raising the question whether the risk of vaccination exceeds the benefit in travelers. To provide some guidance on this point, the rate of vaccine-related injury is compared with the rate of naturally acquired disease in a new analysis that estimates the immunologically susceptible denominator population in YF endemic and epidemic areas. For many years, the risk of vaccine-related illness and death was similar to the risk of illness and death from natural infection with YF in South America. Africa posed a substantially higher estimated risk of wild-type YF than vaccine-related injury. Multiple factors should be considered in making decisions about YF vaccination, including specific destination, season of the year, local evidence for YF transmission, likelihood of exposure to vector mosquitoes and individual risk factors for YEL-AVD, with the goal of increasing vaccine coverage for travel to high-risk areas and reducing unnecessary vaccination. Prospects for future, safer vaccines are also described."
vaccines,"OBJECTIVE
To quantify the risk of anaphylaxis after vaccination of children and adolescents.


METHODS
The study population consisted of children and adolescents who were enrolled at 4 health maintenance organizations that participated in the Vaccine Safety Datalink Project. For the period 1991-1997, we identified potential cases by searching for occurrences of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 995.0 (anaphylactic shock), E948.0 through E948.9 (adverse reaction from bacterial vaccines), and E949.0 through E949.9 (adverse reaction from other vaccines and biological substances). At 1 study site, we also included a range of other allergy codes. We restricted to diagnoses on days 0 to 2 after vaccination (ICD-9 995.0) or day 0 (all other ICD-9 codes). We then reviewed the medical record to confirm the diagnosis.


RESULTS
We identified 5 cases of potentially vaccine-associated anaphylaxis after administration of 7 644 049 vaccine doses, for a risk of 0.65 cases/million doses (95% confidence interval: 0.21-1.53). None of the episodes resulted in death. Vaccines that were administered before the anaphylactic episodes were generally given in combination and included measles-mumps-rubella, hepatitis B, diphtheria-tetanus, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and oral polio vaccine. One case of anaphylaxis followed measles-mumps-rubella vaccine alone. At the site at which we reviewed additional allergy codes, we identified 1 case after 653 990 vaccine doses, for a risk of 1.53 cases/million doses (95% confidence interval: 0.04-8.52).


CONCLUSIONS
Patients and health care providers can be reassured that vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is a rare event. Nevertheless, providers should be prepared to provide immediate medical treatment should it occur."
vaccines,"Summary Increasingly, there is need for methods to control cattle tick (Boophilus microplus) infestations by the use of non-chemical technology. This need is brought about by a mixture of market forces and the failure or inadequacy of existing technology. A recombinant vaccine has now been developed against the tick. This vaccine relies on the uptake with the blood meal of antibody directed against a critical protein in the tick gut. The isolation of the vaccine antigen, Bm86, and its production as a recombinant protein is briefly described. The vaccine has been tested in the field, has been taken through the full registration process and is now in commercial use in Australia. A related development has occurred in Cuba. The potential for improvement of the current vaccine and for the development of similar vaccines against other haematophagous parasites is discussed."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The RTS,S/AS malaria vaccine is being developed for delivery through the World Health Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). We assessed the feasibility of integrating RTS,S/AS02D into a standard EPI schedule for infants.


METHODS
In this phase 2B, single-center, double-blind, controlled trial involving 340 infants in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, we randomly assigned 340 infants to receive three doses of either the RTS,S/AS02D vaccine or the hepatitis B vaccine at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. All infants also received a vaccine containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, whole-cell pertussis vaccine, and conjugated Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPw/Hib). The primary objectives were the occurrence of serious adverse events during a 9-month surveillance period and a demonstration of noninferiority of the responses to the EPI vaccines (DTPw/Hib and hepatitis B surface antigen) with coadministration of the RTS,S/AS02D vaccine, as compared with the hepatitis B vaccine. The detection of antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite and efficacy against malaria infection were secondary objectives.


RESULTS
At least one serious adverse event was reported in 31 of 170 infants who received the RTS,S/AS02D vaccine (18.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.7 to 24.9) and in 42 of 170 infants who received the hepatitis B vaccine (24.7%; 95% CI, 18.4 to 31.9). The results showed the noninferiority of the RTS,S/AS02D vaccine in terms of antibody responses to EPI antigens. One month after vaccination, 98.6% of infants receiving the RTS,S/AS02D vaccine had seropositive titers for anticircumsporozoite antibodies on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). During the 6-month period after the third dose of vaccine, the efficacy of the RTS,S/AS02D vaccine against first infection with P. falciparum malaria was 65.2% (95% CI, 20.7 to 84.7; P=0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
The use of the RTS,S/AS02D vaccine in infants had a promising safety profile, did not interfere with the immunologic responses to coadministered EPI antigens, and reduced the incidence of malaria infection. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00289185.)"
vaccines,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 170 million people globally and is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis, transplantation and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current gold-standard therapy often fails, has significant side effects in many cases and is expensive. No vaccine is currently available. The fact that a significant proportion of infected people spontaneously control HCV infection in the setting of an appropriate immune response suggests that a vaccine for HCV is a realistic goal. A comparative analysis of infected people with distinct clinical outcomes has enabled the characterization of many important innate and adaptive immune processes associated with viral control. It is clear that a successful HCV vaccine will need to exploit and enhance these natural immune defense mechanisms. New HCV vaccine approaches, including peptide, recombinant protein, DNA and vector-based vaccines, have recently reached Phase I/II human clinical trials. Some of these technologies have generated robust antiviral immunity in healthy volunteers and infected patients. The challenge now is to move forward into larger at-risk or infected populations to truly test efficacy."
vaccines,"The development of effective malaria vaccines may be hindered by extensive genetic diversity in the surface proteins being employed as vaccine antigens. Understanding of the extent and dynamics of genetic diversity in vaccine antigens is needed to guide rational vaccine design and to interpret the results of vaccine efficacy trials conducted in malaria endemic areas. Molecular epidemiological, population genetic, and structural approaches are being employed to try to identify immunologically relevant polymorphism in vaccine antigens. The results of these studies will inform choices of which alleles to include in multivalent or chimeric vaccines; however, additional molecular and immuno‐epidemiological studies in a variety of geographic locations will be necessary for these approaches to succeed. Alternative means of overcoming antigenic diversity are also being explored, including boosting responses to critical conserved regions of current vaccine antigens, identifying new, more conserved and less immunodominant antigens, and developing whole‐organism vaccines. Continued creative application and integration of tools from multiple disciplines, including epidemiology, immunology, molecular biology, and evolutionary genetics and genomics, will likely be required to develop broadly protective vaccines against Plasmodium and other antigenically complex pathogens."
vaccines,"MF59 is a well-established, safe and potent vaccine adjuvant that has been licensed for more than 13 years for use in an influenza vaccine focused on elderly subjects (Fluad®, Novartis, Cambridge, MA, USA). Recently, MF59 was shown to be safe in a seasonal influenza vaccine for young children and was able to increase vaccine efficacy from 43 to 89%. A key and consistent feature of MF59 is the ability of the emulsion to induce fast priming of influenza antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell responses, to induce strong and long-lasting memory T- and B-cell responses and to broaden the immune response beyond the influenza strains actually included in the vaccine. The enhanced breadth of response is valuable in the seasonal setting, but is particularly valuable in a (pre-) pandemic setting, when it is difficult to predict which strain will emerge to cause the pandemic. We have shown that the ability of MF59 to increase the breadth of immune response against influenza vaccines is mainly due to the spreading of the repertoire of the B-cell epitopes recognized on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the influenza virus."
vaccines,"To identify immunological predictors of resistance to influenza A infection and illness, the immunological status of live and inactivated virus vaccines subsequently challenged with H1N1 or H3N2 wild-type virus was examined. We refer to prechallenge antibodies of vaccinees receiving live attenuated virus as infection induced and those receiving inactivated virus as inactivated vaccine induced. Inactivated vaccine-induced protection against wild-type virus infection or illness correlated with the level of neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody in serum, local hemagglutinin immunoglobulin G (IgG) (but not IgA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody, and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody in serum. In contrast, infection-induced resistance to wild-type virus infection correlated with local hemagglutinin IgA antibody and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody in serum, but not with hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody in serum. These observations suggest that live vaccine virus infection-induced and inactivated vaccine-induced immunity may involve different compartments of the immune system; sufficient antibody in either serum or nasal secretions is capable of conferring resistance."
vaccines,"Antigenically well-matched vaccines against highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses are urgently required. Human serum samples after immunization with MF59 or nonadjuvanted A/duck/Singapore/97 (H5N3) vaccine were tested for antibody to 1997-2004 human H5N1 viruses. Antibody responses to 3 doses of nonadjuvanted vaccine were poor and were higher after MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, with seroconversion rates to A/HongKong/156/97, A/HongKong/213/03, A/Thailand/16/04, and A/Vietnam/1203/04 of 100% (P < .0001), 100% (P < .0001), 71% (P = .0004), and 43% (P = .0128) in 14 subjects, respectively, compared with 27%, 27%, 0%, and 0% in 11 who received nonadjuvanted vaccine. These findings have implications for the rational design of pandemic vaccines against influenza H5."
vaccines,"During the last century several approaches have been followed for the development of vaccines. These include live-attenuated viruses and bacteria, killed microorganisms and the subunit vaccines [1]. With the introduction of recombinant DNA technologies, new approaches have been exploited for vaccine manufacturing. However, the major problem remains the rapid identification of highly immunogenic and protective antigens suitable for vaccine development, which still relies on standard biochemical and microbiological techniques. The advent of genomics has greatly contributed to providing a new impulse to the microbial field. The complete genomic sequence of a human pathogen represents a new unexploited field, to be used for the design of novel vaccines and antimicrobial drugs. In the case of meningococcus B, four decades of continuous efforts, using conventional technologies of purifying antigens from the microorganism, had not been sufficient to deliver an effective and universal vaccine. It was therefore decided to obtain the genomic sequence of serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB) and use this information to identify vaccine candidates. This approach was named ‘reverse vaccinology’ [2]."
vaccines,"PURPOSE: Docetaxel has activity against androgen-independent prostate cancer and preclinical studies have shown that taxane-based chemotherapy can enhance antitumor response of vaccines. The primary objective of this study was to determine if concurrent docetaxel (with dexamethasone) had any effect on generating an immune response to the vaccine. Secondary end points were whether vaccine could be given safely with docetaxel and the clinical outcome of the treatment regimen. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The vaccination regimen was composed of (a) recombinant vaccinia virus (rV) that expresses the prostate-specific antigen gene (rV-PSA) admixed with (b) rV that expresses the B7.1 costimulatory gene (rV-B7.1), and (c) sequential booster vaccinations with recombinant fowlpox virus (rF-) containing the PSA gene (rF-PSA). Patients received granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor with each vaccination. Twenty-eight patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer were randomized to receive either vaccine and weekly docetaxel or vaccine alone. Patients on the vaccine alone arm were allowed to cross over to receive docetaxel alone at time of disease progression. The ELISPOT assay was used to monitor immune responses for PSA-specific T cells. RESULTS: The median increase in these T-cell precursors to PSA was 3.33-fold in both arms following 3 months of therapy. In addition, immune responses to other prostate cancer-associated tumor antigens were also detected postvaccination. Eleven patients who progressed on vaccine alone crossed over to receive docetaxel at time of progression. Median progression-free survival on docetaxel was 6.1 months after receiving vaccine compared with 3.7 months with the same regimen in a historical control. CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical trial to show that docetaxel can be administered safely with immunotherapy without inhibiting vaccine specific T-cell responses. Furthermore, patients previously vaccinated with an anticancer vaccine may respond longer to docetaxel compared with a historical control of patients receiving docetaxel alone. Larger prospective clinical studies will be required to validate these findings."
vaccines,"Background Recent importation of Lassa fever into Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States by travelers on commercial airlines from Africa underscores the public health challenge of emerging viruses. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines for Lassa fever, and no experimental vaccine has completely protected nonhuman primates against a lethal challenge. Methods and Findings We developed a replication-competent vaccine against Lassa virus based on attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing the Lassa viral glycoprotein. A single intramuscular vaccination of the Lassa vaccine elicited a protective immune response in nonhuman primates against a lethal Lassa virus challenge. Vaccine shedding was not detected in the monkeys, and none of the animals developed fever or other symptoms of illness associated with vaccination. The Lassa vaccine induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in the four vaccinated and challenged monkeys. Despite a transient Lassa viremia in vaccinated animals 7 d after challenge, the vaccinated animals showed no evidence of clinical disease. In contrast, the two control animals developed severe symptoms including rashes, facial edema, and elevated liver enzymes, and ultimately succumbed to the Lassa infection. Conclusion Our data suggest that the Lassa vaccine candidate based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus is safe and highly efficacious in a relevant animal model that faithfully reproduces human disease."
vaccines,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is one of the main causes of acute hepatitis worldwide. A recombinant hepatitis E vaccine, HEV 239, has been licensed in China for immunizing adults of 16 y old and above. The vaccine antigen contains pORF2 aa 368 - 606 of the HEV genotype 1 expressed in E. coli. The quality of the vaccine is controlled through a combination of biophysical, biochemical and immunochemical methods. The vaccine is well tolerated in adults. The efficacy of the HEV 239 vaccine against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection had been proven to be high during a Phase III clinical trial and long-term follow up. The safety and efficacy of HEV 239 vaccine in certain high-risk populations remains to be further investigated."
vaccines,"Background The incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases is directly related to the number of unvaccinated children. Parents who refuse vaccination of their children frequently express concerns about vaccine safety. The Internet can influence perceptions about vaccines because it is the fastest growing source of consumer health information. However, few studies have analyzed vaccine criticism on the Web. Objective The purposes of this paper are to examine vaccine criticism on the Internet and to analyze the websites in order to identify common characteristics and ethical allegations. Methods A structured Web search was conducted for the terms “vaccine,” “vaccination,” “vaccinate,” and “anti-vaccination” using a metasearch program that incorporated 8 search engines. This yielded 1138 Web pages representing 750 sites. Two researchers reviewed the sites for inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting in 78 vaccine-critical sites, which were then abstracted for design, content, and allegations. Results The most common characteristic of vaccine-critical websites was the inclusion of statements linking vaccinations with specific adverse reactions, especially idiopathic chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, autism, and diabetes. Other common attributes (≥ 70% of websites) were links to other vaccine-critical websites; charges that vaccines contain contaminants, mercury, or “hot lots” that cause adverse events; claims that vaccines provide only temporary protection and that the diseases prevented are mild; appeals for responsible parenting through education and resisting the establishment; allegations of conspiracies and cover-ups to hide the truth about vaccine safety; and charges that civil liberties are violated through mandatory vaccination. Conclusions Vaccine-critical websites frequently make serious allegations. With the burgeoning of the Internet as a health information source, an undiscerning or incompletely educated public may accept these claims and refuse vaccination of their children. As this occurs, the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases can be expected to rise."
vaccines,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli(ETEC) is the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in children in Africa, Asia and Latin America and in travelers to these regions. Despite this, no effective vaccine for ETEC is available. ETEC causes disease by colonizing the small intestine with colonization factors, most of which are fimbriae, and production of heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins. Antibodies against heat-labile enterotoxin and the colonization factors have been shown to be protective, and local immunity in the gut seems to be of prime importance for protection. Hence, several inactivated and live candidate ETEC vaccines consisting of toxin antigens, alone or together with colonization factors, have been evaluated in clinical trials. In this review, the authors describe ETEC vaccine development in progress and the rationale for constructing different types of vaccines. They also discuss possibilities of enhancing immune responses to candidate ETEC vaccines, particularly in children."
vaccines,"Protection against oncogenic non-vaccine types (cross-protection) offered by human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines may provide a significant medical benefit. Available clinical efficacy data suggest the two licensed vaccines (HPV-16/18 vaccine, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals [GSK], and HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine, Merck & Co., Inc.) differ in terms of protection against oncogenic non-vaccine HPV types -31/45. The immune responses induced by the two vaccines against these two non-vaccine HPV types (cross-reactivity) was compared in an observer-blind study up to Month 24 (18 months post-vaccination), in women HPV DNA-negative and seronegative prior to vaccination for the HPV type analyzed (HPV-010 [NCT00423046]). Geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) measured by pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were similar between vaccines for HPV-31/45. Seropositivity rates for HPV-31 were also similar between vaccines; however, there was a trend for higher seropositivity with the HPV-16/18 vaccine (13.0–16.7%) versus the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (0.0–5.0%) for HPV-45 with PBNA, but not ELISA. HPV-31/45 cross-reactive memory B-cell responses were comparable between vaccines. Circulating antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies were higher for the HPV-16/18 vaccine than the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (HPV-31 [geometric mean ratio [GMR] =2.0; p=0.0002] and HPV-45 [GMR=2.6; p=0.0092]), as were the proportion of T-cell responders (HPV-31, p=0.0009; HPV-45, p=0.0793). In conclusion, immune response to oncogenic non-vaccine HPV types -31/45 was generally similar for both vaccines with the exception of T-cell response which was higher with the HPV-16/18 vaccine. Considering the differences in cross-protective efficacy between the two vaccines, the results might provide insights into the underlying mechanism(s) of protection."
vaccines,"Biodegradable polymeric microparticles of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) have been extensively evaluated for drug delivery and vaccine applications over the last three decades. Despite a wealth of studies on the use of PLG microparticles in vaccines through controlled release of antigens, there is no commercial PLG-based vaccine as yet. The key challenge that prevented the development of PLG microparticles as commercial vaccines was the instability of encapsulated antigen. Over the years, advancements were made towards maintaining antigen integrity during PLG microparticle preparation and sterilization. In parallel and independently, development of PLG microparticles as therapeutic commercial products established PLG with an excellent safety record in humans, and as a suitable candidate for next-generation vaccines. Through the combination of Toll-like receptor agonist encapsulation and surface adsorption of antigen, PLG microparticles can be used as a vaccine adjuvant to address unmet medical needs, such as vaccines against HIV, malaria and TB. With strategic development of PLG-based vaccines, PLG microparticles can offer advantages over the conventional vaccine adjuvants allowing commercial development of this adjuvant."
vaccines,"OBJECTIVE
To fill the large ""gaps and limitations"" in current scientific knowledge of rare vaccine adverse events identified in recent reviews of the Institute of Medicine.


METHODS
Computerized information on immunization, medical outcomes, and potential confounders on more than 500 000 children 0 to 6 years of age is linked annually at several health maintenance organizations to create a large cohort for multiple epidemiologic studies of vaccine safety.


RESULTS
Analysis of 3 years of follow-up data shows that 549 488 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and 310 618 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines have been administered to children in the study cohort. Analyses for associations between vaccines and 34 medical outcomes are underway. Screening of automated data shows that seizures are associated with receipt of DTP on the same day (relative risk [RR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 4.0) and 8 to 14 days after receipt of MMR (RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.1 to 4.2). The diversity of vaccination exposures in this large cohort permits us to show that an apparent association of seizures 8 to 14 days after Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1) was attributable to confounding by simultaneous MMR vaccination; the association disappears with appropriate adjustment (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.4).


CONCLUSION
Preliminary design, data collection, and analytic capability of the Vaccine Safety Datalink project has been validated by replication of previous known associations between seizures and DTP and MMR vaccines. The diversity in vaccine administration schedules permits potential disentangling of effects of simultaneous and combined vaccinations. The project provides a model of public health-managed care collaborations in addition to an excellent infrastructure for safety and other studies of vaccines."
vaccines,"Background: Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods: Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings: 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (< £16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

vaccines,"In this observer-blind study (NCT00423046), women (N=1,106), stratified by age (18–26, 27–35, 36–45 years), were randomized (1:1) to receive the HPV-16/18 vaccine (Cervarix®, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Months 0,1,6) or the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (Gardasil® Merck & Co., Inc., Months 0,2,6). Month 7 results were previously reported; we now report Month 24 results. In the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity (seronegative and DNA-negative at baseline for HPV type analyzed), seropositivity rates of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) [pseudovirion-based neutralization assay] were, across all age strata, 100% (HPV-16/18 vaccine) and 97.5–100% (HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine) for HPV-16, and 99.0–100% (HPV-16/18 vaccine) and 72.3–84.4% (HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine) for HPV-18. Corresponding geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 2.4–5.8-fold higher for HPV-16 and 7.7–9.4-fold higher for HPV-18 with the HPV-16/18 vaccine versus the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine; HPV-16 and HPV-18 GMTs were significantly higher with the HPV-16/18 vaccine than the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (p<0.0001) in the total vaccinated cohort (received ≥1 vaccine dose, irrespective of baseline sero/DNA-status). Similar results were obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positivity rates and GMTs of antigen-specific IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions (ELISA) were not significantly different between vaccines. At Month 24, CD4+ T-cell responses for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were higher with the HPV-16/18 vaccine; memory B-cell response was higher for HPV-18 with the HPV-16/18 vaccine and similar between vaccines for HPV-16. Both vaccines were generally well tolerated. Although an immunological correlate of protection has not been defined, differences in the magnitude of immune response between vaccines may represent determinants of duration of protection."

vaccines,"The sanofi pasteur tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate is composed of 4 recombinant live attenuated vaccines based on a yellow fever vaccine 17D (YFV 17D) backbone, each expressing the prM and envelope genes of one of the four dengue virus serotypes. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the TV dengue vaccine is genetically and phenotypically stable, non-hepatotropic, less neurovirulent than YFV 17D and does not infect mosquitoes by the oral route. In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies also showed that the TV dengue vaccine induced controlled stimulation in human dendritic cells, and significant immune responses in monkeys. TV dengue vaccine reactogenicity, viraemia induction and antibody responses were investigated in three Phase I trials in the USA, the Philippines and Mexico, in a two or three-dose regimen over a 12 month period. Results showed that the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate and transient in nature. Viraemia was transient and low, and was not increased after initial dengue TV administration, even in the case of incomplete responses. Seropositivity [≥ 10 in a PRNT 50 assay] was 100% for all four serotypes in flavivirus-naive adults injected with 3 doses of TV dengue vaccine in the USA. Similarly, seropositivity was 88–100% following three administrations in flavivirus-naive Mexican children aged 2–5 years. Furthermore, the proportion of seropositive subjects increased with each dengue TV injection in the Philippines where baseline flavivirus immunity was high. Responses were also monitored at the cellular level in humans, and their level and nature were in good agreement with the observed safety and the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Finally, the challenges inherent to the development of such TV dengue vaccines will also be discussed in the last part of this review. In conclusion, preclinical and clinical results support the favorable immunogenicity and short-term safety of the dengue TV vaccine. An extensive clinical development program for dengue TV is underway including completion of the enrollment of 4000 4-11 years old children in an efficacy trial in Thailand, in an area of high dengue incidence. Assuming continued successful outcomes, initial submissions to regulatory authorities are envisaged within a 5-year period."
vaccines,"Baculovirus and insect cell culture technologies have mostly been limited to research laboratories for the transient expression of target proteins for drug development purposes. With the renaissance of the vaccine field and the regulatory acceptance of recombinant DNA technology, the baculovirus expression system has been more broadly adopted for the development of subunit vaccines, including virus-like particles. In the numerous clinical trials extensively discussed and cross-referenced in this article, product quality, safety and efficacy have been demonstrated for many candidate vaccines targeting infectious diseases. The 2007 market authorization of Cervarix™, a bivalent human papillomavirus virus-like particle vaccine against cervical cancer, was a critical milestone for the regulatory acceptance of insect cell technology in manufacturing human vaccines, opening the door to the approval of more baculovirus-derived vaccines. Insect cell technology is now a dominant platform for veterinary vaccines. This article covers the application of recombinant baculovirus as vectored vaccines to mediate systemic and mucosal immune responses through the display or expression of foreign antigens. We will probably observe increasingly more baculovirus-derived products and market licensing of safe and efficacious vaccines."
vaccines,"Over the last few decades, different types of inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccines have been developed: several aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines and an aluminum-free, virosome-formulated vaccine. Both types of vaccines are whole-virus preparations that are produced by growth of HAV strains in human diploid cell cultures and are subsequently inactivated with formaldehyde. This review summarizes all published papers on a virosome-formulated vaccine, Epaxal®, based on formalin inactivated HAV (strain RG-SB) adsorbed to the surface of special liposomes (virosomes), that replace aluminum hydroxide as the adjuvant principle. A single injection of virosomal HAV vaccine is well tolerated and highly immunogenic, with 88–97% of seroprotection 2 weeks after a first dose. HAV virosomal vaccine can be administered concomitantly with other vaccines, without inducing antigenic competition. Direct comparison with aluminum-adsorbed vaccine has shown that the immunogenicity was similar, but fewer local reactions were reported with Epaxal. Recent studies in children have demonstrated that Epaxal Junior is also an excellent HAV vaccine for mass vaccination programs."
vaccines,"A subunit vaccine, RBD-S, is under development to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is classified by the US NIH as a category C pathogen. This vaccine is comprised of a recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and formulated on alum, together with a synthetic glucopyranosyl lipid A. The vaccine would induce neutralizing antibodies without causing Th2-type immunopathology. Vaccine development is being led by the nonprofit product development partnership; Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in collaboration with two academic partners (the New York Blood Center and University of Texas Medical Branch); an industrial partner (Immune Design Corporation); and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. A roadmap for the product development of the RBD-S SARS vaccine is outlined with a goal to manufacture the vaccine for clinical testing within the next 5 years."
vaccines,"A simple generic peptide-based vaccine structure that targets Toll-like receptor 2-expressing dendritic cells and causes their activation is described. The vaccines are totally synthetic, serve as their own adjuvant, and are composed of (i) a single helper T cell epitope, (ii) a target epitope that is either recognized by CD8+ T cells or B cells, and (iii) a Toll-like receptor 2-targeting lipid moiety, S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]cysteine, that is situated between the peptide epitopes to form a branched configuration. The different CD8+ T cell epitopes examined were from (i) influenza virus, (ii) the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, and (iii) ovalbumin as a model tumor antigen. Vaccines containing a B cell epitope from gastrin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone as a B cell epitope were also examined for their ability to elicit antibody against the parent hormones. Each of the vaccines was capable of inducing either CD8+ T cell or antibody-mediated immune responses. The lipidated vaccines, but not the nonlipidated vaccines, were able to mediate protection against viral or bacterial infection and mediate prophylactic and therapeutic anticancer activity. The two hormone-based vaccines induced high antibody titers, which in the case of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone resulted in abrogation of reproductive function. These results highlight the utility of simple, totally synthetic, epitope-based vaccines."
vaccines,"Vaccines against viral disease have traditionally relied on attenuated virus strains or inactivation of infectious virus. Subunit vaccines based on viral proteins expressed in heterologous systems have been effective for some pathogens, but have often suffered from poor immunogenicity due to incorrect protein folding or modification. In this review we focus on a specific class of viral subunit vaccine that mimics the overall structure of virus particles and thus preserves the native antigenic conformation of the immunogenic proteins. These virus‑like particles (VLPs) have been produced for a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses, and have unique advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity over previous approaches. With new VLP vaccines for papillomavirus beginning to reach the market place we argue that this technology has now ‘come‑of‑age’ and must be considered a viable vaccine strategy."
vaccines,"Adjuvants are critical components of many vaccines. The majority of existing vaccines contain a single adjuvant. Owing to their inherent limitations, no single adjuvant is capable of inducing all the protective immune responses required in the many different vaccines. Consequently, investigators are exploring the potential of using formulations with multiple adjuvants in a vaccine. An emerging paradigm is that careful selection of adjuvant combinations can result in complementary and even synergistic enhancement of immune responses to vaccines. This approach is promising and presents tremendous opportunities for vaccinologists to tailor immune responses to specific vaccines. In this article, adjuvant combinations at different stages of development will be reviewed."
vaccines,"The quest for an efficacious malaria vaccine has been ongoing for nearly a century with limited success. Malaria remains one of the most significant infectious diseases affecting human populations in developing countries. The identification of a number of major malaria parasite antigens focused efforts on the development of subunit vaccines but has so far yielded only one partially efficacious vaccine candidate, RTS/S. The lack of high vaccine efficacy observed with subunit vaccine candidates raises principal doubts that the development of a single antigen- or even a multi-antigen malaria subunit vaccine is possible. Fortunately, it has been demonstrated in animal studies and experimental clinical studies that immunizations with live-attenuated sporozoite stages of the malaria parasite confer long lasting, sterile protection against infection, providing a benchmark for vaccine development. These early successful vaccinations with live-attenuated malaria parasites did not however, promote a developmental path forward for such a vaccine approach. The discovery of genetically engineered parasite strains that are fully attenuated during the early asymptomatic liver infection and confer complete sterile protection in animal malaria models support the development of a live attenuated sporozoite vaccine for Plasmodium falciparum and its accelerated safety and efficacy testing in malaria challenge models and in malaria endemic areas."
vaccines,"Vaccine design and licensing depend on the choice of protective antigens and the demonstration of their efficacy. Ideally efficacy correlates with some measurement of immune response, although occasionally the correlation is weak and in the case of some vaccines uncertain. This paper attempts to review what is known about correlates of vaccine-induced protection. Although mucosal and cellular immune responses are clearly important to protection by some vaccines, most vaccines licensed today depend for their efficacy on serum antibodies. Particular levels of antibodies can be identified that confer protection most of the time. A condition for the efficacy of antibodies is functionality, i.e. their ability to kill or inactivate pathogens. The immune system is redundant, and the different types of responses to vaccines act synergistically."
vaccines,"Vaccine-delivery systems are generally particulate (e.g., emulsions, microparticles and liposomes) and have comparable dimensions to the pathogens, which the immune system evolved to combat. Increasingly more sophisticated delivery systems are being developed in which immunostimulatory adjuvants may be incorporated with the antigen. The rationale for this approach is to ensure that both the antigen and adjuvant are delivered into the same population of antigen-presenting cells. Enhancement of adjuvant activity through the use of micro- and nanoparticulate delivery systems is particularly exciting, as synergistic effects are often seen resulting in immune responses stronger than those elicited by the adjuvant or delivery system alone. Micro- and nanoparticles also offer the possibility of enhancement of their uptake by appropriate cells through manipulation of their surface properties. The next important step in the development of many of the experimental microparticle- and nanoparticle-based technologies will be evaluation of effectiveness in human trials."

Engl J 2015; 372:113 Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by 1 of 4 virus serotypes from the ﬂ avivirus genus present in tropical and subtropical regions. This study reports the results from a phase 3 randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled ef ﬁ cacy trial of a recombinant, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) involving healthy children ages 9 to 16 years in 5 Latin American countries. The study, sponsored by Sano ﬁ Pasteur, took place in 22 centers in Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Honduras from June 2011 to March 2012. The investiga-tional vaccine consists of 4 recombinant dengue vaccine vi-ruses, which were constructed by replacing the genes that encode the premembrane and envelope proteins of the yel-low fever 17D vaccine virus with those from wild-type dengue viruses."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
In the RV144 trial, the estimated efficacy of a vaccine regimen against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was 31.2%. We performed a case-control analysis to identify antibody and cellular immune correlates of infection risk.


METHODS
In pilot studies conducted with RV144 blood samples, 17 antibody or cellular assays met prespecified criteria, of which 6 were chosen for primary analysis to determine the roles of T-cell, IgG antibody, and IgA antibody responses in the modulation of infection risk. Assays were performed on samples from 41 vaccinees who became infected and 205 uninfected vaccinees, obtained 2 weeks after final immunization, to evaluate whether immune-response variables predicted HIV-1 infection through 42 months of follow-up.


RESULTS
Of six primary variables, two correlated significantly with infection risk: the binding of IgG antibodies to variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2) of HIV-1 envelope proteins (Env) correlated inversely with the rate of HIV-1 infection (estimated odds ratio, 0.57 per 1-SD increase; P=0.02; q=0.08), and the binding of plasma IgA antibodies to Env correlated directly with the rate of infection (estimated odds ratio, 1.54 per 1-SD increase; P=0.03; q=0.08). Neither low levels of V1V2 antibodies nor high levels of Env-specific IgA antibodies were associated with higher rates of infection than were found in the placebo group. Secondary analyses suggested that Env-specific IgA antibodies may mitigate the effects of potentially protective antibodies.


CONCLUSIONS
This immune-correlates study generated the hypotheses that V1V2 antibodies may have contributed to protection against HIV-1 infection, whereas high levels of Env-specific IgA antibodies may have mitigated the effects of protective antibodies. Vaccines that are designed to induce higher levels of V1V2 antibodies and lower levels of Env-specific IgA antibodies than are induced by the RV144 vaccine may have improved efficacy against HIV-1 infection."
vaccines,"A public-private partnership and platform for harmonized clinical trials aims to accelerate licensure and distribution There is an unprecedented need to manufacture and distribute enough safe and effective vaccine to immunize an extraordinarily large number of individuals in order to protect the entire global community from the continued threat of morbidity and mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The global need for vaccine and the wide geographic diversity of the pandemic require more than one effective vaccine approach. Collaboration will be essential among biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, many of which are bringing forward a variety of vaccine approaches (1). The full development pathway for an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 will require that industry, government, and academia collaborate in unprecedented ways, each adding their individual strengths. We discuss one such collaborative program that has recently emerged: the ACTIV (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) public-private partnership. Spearheaded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), this effort brings together the strengths of all sectors at this time of global urgency. We further discuss a collaborative platform for conducting harmonized, randomized controlled vaccine efficacy trials. This mechanism aims to generate essential safety and efficacy data for several candidate vaccines in parallel, so as to accelerate the licensure and distribution of multiple vaccine platforms and vaccines to protect against COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019)."

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
An improvement in overall survival among patients with metastatic melanoma has been an elusive goal. In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab--which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma.


METHODS
A total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.


RESULTS
The median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15% of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1%), and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events.


CONCLUSIONS
Ipilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse events can be severe, long-lasting, or both, but most are reversible with appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00094653.)"
vaccines,"IMPORTANCE
Parents hesitant to vaccinate their children may delay routine immunizations or seek exemptions from state vaccine mandates. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Improved understanding of the association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed.


OBJECTIVE
To review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine delay, refusal, or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 vaccine-preventable diseases with recent US outbreaks.


EVIDENCE REVIEW
Search of PubMed through November 30, 2015, for reports of US measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the United States (after January 1, 2000), endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in US pertussis incidence (after January 1, 1977), and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of vaccine delay or exemption.


FINDINGS
We identified 18 published measles studies (9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak reports), which described 1416 measles cases (individual age range, 2 weeks-84 years; 178 cases younger than 12 months) and more than half (56.8%) had no history of measles vaccination. Of the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being vaccine eligible and 405 (70.6%) of these had nonmedical exemptions (eg, exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons, as opposed to medical contraindications; 41.8% of total). Among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks, which included 10,609 individuals for whom vaccination status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years), the 5 largest statewide epidemics had substantial proportions (range, 24%-45%) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. However, several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations, indicating waning immunity. Nine reports (describing 12 outbreaks) provided detailed vaccination data on unimmunized cases; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59% through 93% of unvaccinated individuals were intentionally unvaccinated.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some populations."
vaccines,"Designer Anti-HIV Developing a protective HIV vaccine remains a top global health priority. One strategy to identify potential vaccine candidates is to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies from infected individuals and then attempt to elicit the same antibody response through vaccination (see the Perspective by Burton and Weiss). Wu et al. (p. 856, published online 8 July) now report the identification of three broadly neutralizing antibodies, isolated from an HIV-1–infected individual, that exhibited great breadth and potency of neutralization and were specific for the co-receptor CD4-binding site of the glycoprotein 120 (gp120), part of the viral Env spike. Zhou et al. (p. 811, published online 8 July) analyzed the crystal structure for one of these antibodies, VRC01, in complex with an HIV-1 gp120. VRC01 focuses its binding onto a conformationally invariant domain that is the site of initial CD4 attachment, which allows the antibody to overcome the glycan and conformational masking that diminishes the neutralization potency of most CD4-binding-site antibodies. The epitopes recognized by these antibodies suggest potential immunogens that can inform vaccine design. A human antibody achieves broad neutralization by binding the viral site of recognition for the primary host receptor, CD4. Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are found in the sera of many HIV-1–infected individuals, but the virologic basis of their neutralization remains poorly understood. We used knowledge of HIV-1 envelope structure to develop antigenically resurfaced glycoproteins specific for the structurally conserved site of initial CD4 receptor binding. These probes were used to identify sera with NAbs to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) and to isolate individual B cells from such an HIV-1–infected donor. By expressing immunoglobulin genes from individual cells, we identified three monoclonal antibodies, including a pair of somatic variants that neutralized over 90% of circulating HIV-1 isolates. Exceptionally broad HIV-1 neutralization can be achieved with individual antibodies targeted to the functionally conserved CD4bs of glycoprotein 120, an important insight for future HIV-1 vaccine design."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical to pandemic control.


METHODS
In a community-based, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial, we evaluated four priming injections of a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC-HIV [vCP1521]) plus two booster injections of a recombinant glycoprotein 120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E). The vaccine and placebo injections were administered to 16,402 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 30 years in Rayong and Chon Buri provinces in Thailand. The volunteers, primarily at heterosexual risk for HIV infection, were monitored for the coprimary end points: HIV-1 infection and early HIV-1 viremia, at the end of the 6-month vaccination series and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years.


RESULTS
In the intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,402 subjects, there was a trend toward the prevention of HIV-1 infection among the vaccine recipients, with a vaccine efficacy of 26.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.0 to 47.9; P=0.08). In the per-protocol analysis involving 12,542 subjects, the vaccine efficacy was 26.2% (95% CI, -13.3 to 51.9; P=0.16). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,395 subjects (with the exclusion of 7 subjects who were found to have had HIV-1 infection at baseline), the vaccine efficacy was 31.2% (95% CI, 1.1 to 52.1; P=0.04). Vaccination did not affect the degree of viremia or the CD4+ T-cell count in subjects in whom HIV-1 infection was subsequently diagnosed.


CONCLUSIONS
This ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX B/E vaccine regimen may reduce the risk of HIV infection in a community-based population with largely heterosexual risk. Vaccination did not affect the viral load or CD4+ count in subjects with HIV infection. Although the results show only a modest benefit, they offer insight for future research.

vaccines,"ABSTRACT The development of an effective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine is likely to depend on knowledge of circulating variants of genes other than the commonly sequenced gag andenv genes. In addition, full-genome data are particularly limited for HIV-1 subtype C, currently the most commonly transmitted subtype in India and worldwide. Likewise, little is known about sequence variation of HIV-1 in India, the country facing the largest burden of HIV worldwide. Therefore, the objective of this study was to clone and characterize the complete genome of HIV-1 from seroconverters infected with subtype C variants in India. Cocultured HIV-1 isolates were obtained from six seroincident individuals from Pune, India, and virtually full-length HIV-1 genomes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced from each. Sequence analysis revealed that five of the six genomes were of subtype C, while one was a mosaic of subtypes A and C, with multiple breakpoints in env,nef, and the 3′ long terminal repeat as determined by both maximal χ2 analysis and phylogenetic bootstrapping. Sequences were compared for preservation of known cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. Compared with those of the HIV-1LAI sequence, 38% of well-defined CTL epitopes were identical. The proportion of nonconservative substitutions for Env, at 61%, was higher (P < 0.001) than those for Gag (24%), Pol (18%), and Nef (32%). Therefore, characterized CTL epitopes demonstrated substantial differences from subtype B laboratory strains, which were most pronounced in Env. Because these clones were obtained from Indian seroconverters, they are likely to facilitate vaccine-related efforts in India by providing potential antigens for vaccine candidates as well as for assays of vaccine responsiveness."
vaccines,"Group A streptococci are model extracellular gram-positive pathogens responsible for pharyngitis, impetigo, rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis. A resurgence of invasive streptococcal diseases and rheumatic fever has appeared in outbreaks over the past 10 years, with a predominant M1 serotype as well as others identified with the outbreaks. emm (M protein) gene sequencing has changed serotyping, and new virulence genes and new virulence regulatory networks have been defined. The emm gene superfamily has expanded to include antiphagocytic molecules and immunoglobulin-binding proteins with common structural features. At least nine superantigens have been characterized, all of which may contribute to toxic streptococcal syndrome. An emerging theme is the dichotomy between skin and throat strains in their epidemiology and genetic makeup. Eleven adhesins have been reported, and surface plasmin-binding proteins have been defined. The strong resistance of the group A streptococcus to phagocytosis is related to factor H and fibrinogen binding by M protein and to disarming complement component C5a by the C5a peptidase. Molecular mimicry appears to play a role in autoimmune mechanisms involved in rheumatic fever, while nephritis strain-associated proteins may lead to immune-mediated acute glomerulonephritis. Vaccine strategies have focused on recombinant M protein and C5a peptidase vaccines, and mucosal vaccine delivery systems are under investigation."
vaccines,"Anti-HIV Antibodies One of the top priorities for an HIV vaccine is the ability to elicit a broadly neutralizing antibody response, which should provide the best protection against infection. In the 25 years since the discovery of HIV, very few broadly neutralizing antibodies have been identified, and those that do exist were discovered nearly two decades ago. Using a high-throughput culture system, Walker et al. (p. 285; published online 3 September) now identify two additional broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from a clade A HIV-infected African donor. These antibodies exhibit great potency and, in contrast to other known broadly neutralizing antibodies, are able to neutralize a wide range of viruses from many different clades. The antibodies recognize a motif in the trimerized viral envelope protein that is found in conserved regions of the variable loops of the gp120 subunit. Identification of this motif provides an intriguing new target for vaccine development. High-throughput screening has revealed two new broadly neutralizing antibodies from a clade A–infected donor in Africa. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which develop over time in some HIV-1–infected individuals, define critical epitopes for HIV vaccine design. Using a systematic approach, we have examined neutralization breadth in the sera of about 1800 HIV-1–infected individuals, primarily infected with non–clade B viruses, and have selected donors for monoclonal antibody (mAb) generation. We then used a high-throughput neutralization screen of antibody-containing culture supernatants from about 30,000 activated memory B cells from a clade A–infected African donor to isolate two potent mAbs that target a broadly neutralizing epitope. This epitope is preferentially expressed on trimeric Envelope protein and spans conserved regions of variable loops of the gp120 subunit. The results provide a framework for the design of new vaccine candidates for the elicitation of bNAb responses."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
A phase 3 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a prophylactic quadrivalent vaccine in preventing anogenital diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18.


METHODS
In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 5455 women between the ages of 16 and 24 years, we assigned 2723 women to receive vaccine and 2732 to receive placebo at day 1, month 2, and month 6. The coprimary composite end points were the incidence of genital warts, vulvar or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, or cancer and the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cancer associated with HPV type 6, 11, 16, or 18. Data for the primary analysis were collected for a per-protocol susceptible population of women who had no virologic evidence of HPV type 6, 11, 16, or 18 through 1 month after administration of the third dose.


RESULTS
The women were followed for an average of 3 years after administration of the first dose. In the per-protocol population, those followed for vulvar, vaginal, or perianal disease included 2261 women (83%) in the vaccine group and 2279 (83%) in the placebo group. Those followed for cervical disease included 2241 women (82%) in the vaccine group and 2258 (83%) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 100% for each of the coprimary end points. In an intention-to-treat analysis, including those with prevalent infection or disease caused by vaccine-type and non-vaccine-type HPV, vaccination reduced the rate of any vulvar or vaginal perianal lesions regardless of the causal HPV type by 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 49), and the rate of cervical lesions regardless of the causal HPV type by 20% (95% CI, 8 to 31).


CONCLUSIONS
The quadrivalent vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of HPV-associated anogenital diseases in young women. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00092521 [ClinicalTrials.gov].)."
vaccines,"Background In efficacy trials of a tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD‐TDV), excess hospitalizations for dengue were observed among vaccine recipients 2 to 5 years of age. Precise risk estimates according to observed dengue serostatus could not be ascertained because of the limited numbers of samples collected at baseline. We developed a dengue anti–nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) IgG enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and used samples from month 13 to infer serostatus for a post hoc analysis of safety and efficacy. Methods In a case–cohort study, we reanalyzed data from three efficacy trials. For the principal analyses, we used baseline serostatus determined on the basis of measured (when baseline values were available) or imputed (when baseline values were missing) titers from a 50% plaque‐reduction neutralization test (PRNT50), with imputation conducted with the use of covariates that included the month 13 anti‐NS1 assay results. The risk of hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue (VCD), of severe VCD, and of symptomatic VCD according to dengue serostatus was estimated by weighted Cox regression and targeted minimum loss–based estimation. Results Among dengue‐seronegative participants 2 to 16 years of age, the cumulative 5‐year incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 3.06% among vaccine recipients and 1.87% among controls, with a hazard ratio (vaccine vs. control) through data cutoff of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 2.70). Among dengue‐seronegative participants 9 to 16 years of age, the cumulative incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 1.57% among vaccine recipients and 1.09% among controls, with a hazard ratio of 1.41 (95% CI, 0.74 to 2.68). Similar trends toward a higher risk among seronegative vaccine recipients than among seronegative controls were also found for severe VCD. Among dengue‐seropositive participants 2 to 16 years of age and those 9 to 16 years of age, the cumulative incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 0.75% and 0.38%, respectively, among vaccine recipients and 2.47% and 1.88% among controls, with hazard ratios of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.45) and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.31). The risk of severe VCD was also lower among seropositive vaccine recipients than among seropositive controls. Conclusions CYD‐TDV protected against severe VCD and hospitalization for VCD for 5 years in persons who had exposure to dengue before vaccination, and there was evidence of a higher risk of these outcomes in vaccinated persons who had not been exposed to dengue.

vaccines,"Objective. To determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the heptavalent CRM197 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes and to determine the effectiveness of this vaccine against clinical episodes of otitis media. Methods. The Wyeth Lederle Heptavalent CRM197 (PCV) was given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 15 months of age in a double blind trial; 37 868 children were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or meningococcus type C CRM197 conjugate. The primary study outcome was invasive disease caused by vaccine serotype. Other outcomes included overall impact on invasive disease regardless of serotype, effectiveness against clinical otitis media visits and episodes, impact against frequent and severe otitis media and ventilatory tube placement. In addition the serotype‐specific efficacy against otitis media was estimated in an analysis of spontaneously draining ears. Results. In the interim analysis in August, 1998, 17 of the 17 cases of invasive disease caused by vaccine serotype in fully vaccinated children and 5 of 5 of partially vaccinated cases occurred in the control group for a vaccine efficacy of 100%. Blinded case ascertainment was continued until April, 1999. As of that time 40 fully vaccinated cases of invasive disease caused by vaccine serotype had been identified, all but 1 in controls for an efficacy of 97.4% (95% confidence interval, 82.7 to 99.9%), and 52 cases, all but 3 in controls in the intent‐to‐treat analysis for an efficacy of 93.9% (95% confidence interval, 79.6 to 98.5%). There was no evidence of any increase of disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes. Efficacy for otitis media against visits, episodes, frequent otitis and ventilatory tube placement was 8.9, 7.0, 9.3 and 20.1% with P < 0.04 for all. In the analysis of spontaneously draining ears, serotype‐specific effectiveness was 66.7%. Conclusion. This heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate appears to be highly effective in preventing invasive disease in young children and to have a significant impact on otitis media."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The safety and efficacy of an attenuated G1P[8] human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine were tested in a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial.


METHODS
We studied 63,225 healthy infants from 11 Latin American countries and Finland who received two oral doses of either the HRV vaccine (31,673 infants) or placebo (31,552 infants) at approximately two months and four months of age. Severe gastroenteritis episodes were identified by active surveillance. The severity of disease was graded with the use of the 20-point Vesikari scale. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in a subgroup of 20,169 infants (10,159 vaccinees and 10,010 placebo recipients).


RESULTS
The efficacy of the vaccine against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis and against rotavirus-associated hospitalization was 85 percent (P<0.001 for the comparison with placebo) and reached 100 percent against more severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Hospitalization for diarrhea of any cause was reduced by 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 53 percent; P<0.001). During the 31-day window after each dose, six vaccine recipients and seven placebo recipients had definite intussusception (difference in risk, -0.32 per 10,000 infants; 95 percent confidence interval, -2.91 to 2.18; P=0.78).


CONCLUSIONS
Two oral doses of the live attenuated G1P[8] HRV vaccine were highly efficacious in protecting infants against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, significantly reduced the rate of severe gastroenteritis from any cause, and were not associated with an increased risk of intussusception.

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Rotavirus is a leading cause of childhood gastroenteritis and death worldwide.


METHODS
We studied healthy infants approximately 6 to 12 weeks old who were randomly assigned to receive three oral doses of live pentavalent human-bovine (WC3 strain) reassortant rotavirus vaccine containing human serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and P[8] or placebo at 4-to-10-week intervals in a blinded fashion. Active surveillance was used to identify subjects with serious adverse and other events.


RESULTS
The 34,035 infants in the vaccine group and 34,003 in the placebo group were monitored for serious adverse events. Intussusception occurred in 12 vaccine recipients and 15 placebo recipients within one year after the first dose including six vaccine recipients and five placebo recipients within 42 days after any dose (relative risk, 1.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 6.4). The vaccine reduced hospitalizations and emergency department visits related to G1-G4 rotavirus gastroenteritis occurring 14 or more days after the third dose by 94.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 91.2 to 96.6 percent). In a nested substudy, efficacy against any G1-G4 rotavirus gastroenteritis through the first full rotavirus season after vaccination was 74.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 66.8 to 79.9 percent); efficacy against severe gastroenteritis was 98.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88.3 to 100 percent). The vaccine reduced clinic visits for G1-G4 rotavirus gastroenteritis by 86.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 73.9 to 92.5 percent).

This vaccine was efficacious in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis, decreasing severe disease and health care contacts. The risk of intussusception was similar in vaccine and placebo recipients. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00090233.)"
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and diseases caused by HPV are common in boys and men. We report on the safety of a quadrivalent vaccine (active against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and on its efficacy in preventing the development of external genital lesions and anogenital HPV infection in boys and men.


METHODS
We enrolled 4065 healthy boys and men 16 to 26 years of age, from 18 countries in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The primary efficacy objective was to show that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced the incidence of external genital lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. Efficacy analyses were conducted in a per-protocol population, in which subjects received all three vaccinations and were negative for relevant HPV types at enrollment, and in an intention-to-treat population, in which subjects received vaccine or placebo, regardless of baseline HPV status.


RESULTS
In the intention-to-treat population, 36 external genital lesions were seen in the vaccine group as compared with 89 in the placebo group, for an observed efficacy of 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.8 to 73.8); the efficacy was 65.5% (95% CI, 45.8 to 78.6) for lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. In the per-protocol population, efficacy against lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was 90.4% (95% CI, 69.2 to 98.1). Efficacy with respect to persistent infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 and detection of related DNA at any time was 47.8% (95% CI, 36.0 to 57.6) and 27.1% (95% CI, 16.6 to 36.3), respectively, in the intention-to-treat population and 85.6% (97.5% CI, 73.4 to 92.9) and 44.7% (95% CI, 31.5 to 55.6) in the per-protocol population. Injection-site pain was significantly more frequent among subjects receiving quadrivalent HPV vaccine than among those receiving placebo (57% vs. 51%, P<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevents infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18 and the development of related external genital lesions in males 16 to 26 years of age. (Funded by Merck and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00090285.)."
vaccines,"Malaria Sporozoite Vaccine Each year, hundreds of millions of people are infected with Plasmodium falciparum, the mosquito-borne parasite that causes malaria. A preventative vaccine is greatly needed. Seder et al. (p. 1359, published online 8 August; see the Perspective by Good) now report the results from a phase I clinical trial where subjects were immunized intravenously with a whole, attenuated sporozoite vaccine. Three of 9 subjects who received four doses and zero of 6 subjects who received five doses of the vaccine went on to develop malaria after controlled malaria infection. Both antibody titers and cellular immune responses correlated positively with the dose of vaccine received, suggesting that both arms of the adaptive immune response may have participated in the observed protection. Intravenous immunization with an attenuated whole malaria sporozoite vaccine protected volunteers in a phase I clinical trial. [Also see Perspective by Good] Consistent, high-level, vaccine-induced protection against human malaria has only been achieved by inoculation of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (SPZ) by mosquito bites. We report that the PfSPZ Vaccine—composed of attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ—was safe and wel-tolerated when administered four to six times intravenously (IV) to 40 adults. Zero of six subjects receiving five doses and three of nine subjects receiving four doses of 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine and five of six nonvaccinated controls developed malaria after controlled human malaria infection (P = 0.015 in the five-dose group and P = 0.028 for overall, both versus controls). PfSPZ-specific antibody and T cell responses were dose-dependent. These data indicate that there is a dose-dependent immunological threshold for establishing high-level protection against malaria that can be achieved with IV administration of a vaccine that is safe and meets regulatory standards."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children worldwide. Data are needed to assess the efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine in African children.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in South Africa (3166 infants; 64.1% of the total) and Malawi (1773 infants; 35.9% of the total) to evaluate the efficacy of a live, oral rotavirus vaccine in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine (in addition to one dose of placebo) or three doses of vaccine - the pooled vaccine group - or three doses of placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Episodes of gastroenteritis caused by wild-type rotavirus during the first year of life were assessed through active follow-up surveillance and were graded with the use of the Vesikari scale.


RESULTS
A total of 4939 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the three groups; 1647 infants received two doses of the vaccine, 1651 infants received three doses of the vaccine, and 1641 received placebo. Of the 4417 infants included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis, severe rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred in 4.9% of the infants in the placebo group and in 1.9% of those in the pooled vaccine group (vaccine efficacy, 61.2%; 95% confidence interval, 44.0 to 73.2). Vaccine efficacy was lower in Malawi than in South Africa (49.4% vs. 76.9%); however, the number of episodes of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis that were prevented was greater in Malawi than in South Africa (6.7 vs. 4.2 cases prevented per 100 infants vaccinated per year). Efficacy against all-cause severe gastroenteritis was 30.2%. At least one serious adverse event was reported in 9.7% of the infants in the pooled vaccine group and in 11.5% of the infants in the placebo group.


CONCLUSIONS
Human rotavirus vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis among African infants during the first year of life. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00241644.)."

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Approximately 20 percent of adults become infected with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16). Although most infections are benign, some progress to anogenital cancer. A vaccine that reduces the incidence of HPV-16 infection may provide important public health benefits.


METHODS
In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned 2392 young women (defined as females 16 to 23 years of age) to receive three doses of placebo or HPV-16 virus-like-particle vaccine (40 microg per dose), given at day 0, month 2, and month 6. Genital samples to test for HPV-16 DNA were obtained at enrollment, one month after the third vaccination, and every six months thereafter. Women were referred for colposcopy according to a protocol. Biopsy tissue was evaluated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and analyzed for HPV-16 DNA with use of the polymerase chain reaction. The primary end point was persistent HPV-16 infection, defined as the detection of HPV-16 DNA in samples obtained at two or more visits. The primary analysis was limited to women who were negative for HPV-16 DNA and HPV-16 antibodies at enrollment and HPV-16 DNA at month 7.


RESULTS
The women were followed for a median of 17.4 months after completing the vaccination regimen. The incidence of persistent HPV-16 infection was 3.8 per 100 woman-years at risk in the placebo group and 0 per 100 woman-years at risk in the vaccine group (100 percent efficacy; 95 percent confidence interval, 90 to 100; P<0.001). All nine cases of HPV-16-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia occurred among the placebo recipients.


CONCLUSIONS
Administration of this HPV-16 vaccine reduced the incidence of both HPV-16 infection and HPV-16-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Immunizing HPV-16-negative women may eventually reduce the incidence of cervical cancer."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND Recent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection confers a predisposition to the development of tuberculosis disease, the leading killer among global infectious diseases. H4:IC31, a candidate subunit vaccine, has shown protection against tuberculosis disease in preclinical models, and observational studies have indicated that primary bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination may offer partial protection against infection. METHODS In this phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 990 adolescents in a high‐risk setting who had undergone neonatal BCG vaccination to receive the H4:IC31 vaccine, BCG revaccination, or placebo. All the participants had negative results on testing for M. tuberculosis infection on the QuantiFERON‐TB Gold In‐tube assay (QFT) and for the human immunodeficiency virus. The primary outcomes were safety and acquisition of M. tuberculosis infection, as defined by initial conversion on QFT that was performed every 6 months during a 2‐year period. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity and sustained QFT conversion to a positive test without reversion to negative status at 3 months and 6 months after conversion. Estimates of vaccine efficacy are based on hazard ratios from Cox regression models and compare each vaccine with placebo. RESULTS Both the BCG and H4:IC31 vaccines were immunogenic. QFT conversion occurred in 44 of 308 participants (14.3%) in the H4:IC31 group and in 41 of 312 participants (13.1%) in the BCG group, as compared with 49 of 310 participants (15.8%) in the placebo group; the rate of sustained conversion was 8.1% in the H4:IC31 group and 6.7% in the BCG group, as compared with 11.6% in the placebo group. Neither the H4:IC31 vaccine nor the BCG vaccine prevented initial QFT conversion, with efficacy point estimates of 9.4% (P=0.63) and 20.1% (P=0.29), respectively. However, the BCG vaccine reduced the rate of sustained QFT conversion, with an efficacy of 45.4% (P=0.03); the efficacy of the H4:IC31 vaccine was 30.5% (P=0.16). There were no clinically significant between‐group differences in the rates of serious adverse events, although mild‐to‐moderate injection‐site reactions were more common with BCG revaccination. CONCLUSIONS In this trial, the rate of sustained QFT conversion, which may reflect sustained M. tuberculosis infection, was reduced by vaccination in a high‐transmission setting. This finding may inform clinical development of new vaccine candidates. (Funded by Aeras and others; C‐040‐404 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02075203.)"
vaccines,"A safe and effective rotavirus vaccine is urgently needed, particularly in developing countries. Critical to vaccine development and implementation is a knowledge base concerning the epidemiology of rotavirus G and P serotypes/genotypes throughout the world. The temporal and geographical distribution of human rotavirus G and P types was reviewed by analysing a total of 45571 strains collected globally from 124 studies reported from 52 countries on five continents published between 1989 and 2004. Four common G types (G1, G2, G3 and G4) in conjunction with P[8] or P[4] represented over 88% of the strains analysed worldwide. In addition, serotype G9 viruses associated with P[8] or P[6] were shown to have emerged as the fourth globally important G type with the relative frequency of 4.1%. When the global G and/or P type distributions were divided into five continents/subcontinents, several characteristic features emerged. For example, the P[8]G1 represented over 70% of rotavirus infections in North America, Europe and Australia, but only about 30% of the infections in South America and Asia, and 23% in Africa. In addition, in Africa (i) the relative frequency of G8 was as high as that of the globally common G3 or G4, (ii) P[6] represented almost one‐third of all P types identified and (iii) 27% of the infections were associated with rotavirus strains bearing unusual combinations such as P[6]G8 or P[4]G8. Furthermore, in South America, uncommon G5 virus appeared to increase its epidemiological importance among children with diarrhea. Such findings have (i) confirmed the importance of continued active rotavirus strain surveillance in a variety of geographical settings and (ii) provided important considerations for the development and implementation of an effective rotavirus vaccine (e.g. a geographical P‐G type adjustment in the formulation of next generation multivalent vaccines).

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The rate of anal cancer is increasing among both women and men, particularly men who have sex with men. Caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily HPV type 16 or 18, anal cancer is preceded by high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 2 or 3). We studied the safety and efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (qHPV) against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 infection in men who have sex with men.


METHODS
In a substudy of a larger double-blind study, we randomly assigned 602 healthy men who have sex with men, 16 to 26 years of age, to receive either qHPV or placebo. The primary efficacy objective was prevention of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or anal cancer related to infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. Efficacy analyses were performed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol efficacy populations. The rates of adverse events were documented.


RESULTS
Efficacy of the qHPV vaccine against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.7 to 67.2) in the intention-to-treat population and 77.5% (95% CI, 39.6 to 93.3) in the per-protocol efficacy population; the corresponding efficacies against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV of any type were 25.7% (95% CI, -1.1 to 45.6) and 54.9% (95% CI, 8.4 to 79.1), respectively. Rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia per 100 person-years were 17.5 in the placebo group and 13.0 in the vaccine group in the intention-to-treat population and 8.9 in the placebo group and 4.0 in the vaccine group in the per-protocol efficacy population. The rate of grade 2 or 3 anal intraepithelial neoplasia related to infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was reduced by 54.2% (95% CI, 18.0 to 75.3) in the intention-to-treat population and by 74.9% (95% CI, 8.8 to 95.4) in the per-protocol efficacy population. The corresponding risks of persistent anal infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 were reduced by 59.4% (95% CI, 43.0 to 71.4) and 94.9% (95% CI, 80.4 to 99.4), respectively. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.


CONCLUSIONS
Use of the qHPV vaccine reduced the rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, including of grade 2 or 3, among men who have sex with men. The vaccine had a favorable safety profile and may help to reduce the risk of anal cancer. (Funded by Merck and the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00090285.)."
vaccines,"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents routinely receive tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (1) at age 11-12 years. ACIP also recommends catch-up vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and varicella vaccine for adolescents who are not up to date with childhood vaccinations. ACIP recommends a booster dose of MenACWY at age 16 years (1). In December 2016, ACIP updated HPV vaccine recommendations to include a 2-dose schedule for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the vaccination series before their 15th birthday (2). To estimate adolescent vaccination coverage in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) for 20,475 adolescents aged 13-17 years.* During 2015-2016, coverage increased for ≥1 dose of Tdap (from 86.4% to 88.0%) and for each HPV vaccine dose (from 56.1% to 60.4% for ≥1 dose). Among adolescents aged 17 years, coverage with ≥2 doses of MenACWY increased from 33.3% to 39.1%. In 2016, 43.4% of adolescents (49.5% of females; 37.5% of males) were up to date with the HPV vaccination series, applying the updated HPV vaccine recommendations retrospectively.† Coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose varied by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status and was lowest (50.4%) among adolescents living in non-MSA areas and highest (65.9%) among those living in MSA central cities.§ Adolescent vaccination coverage continues to improve overall; however, substantial opportunities exist to further increase HPV-associated cancer prevention."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
In early 2000, a protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine targeting seven pneumococcal serotypes was licensed in the United States for use in young children.


METHODS
We examined population-based data from the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to evaluate changes in the burden of invasive disease, defined by isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site. Serotyping and susceptibility testing of isolates were performed. We assessed trends using data from seven geographic areas with continuous participation from 1998 through 2001 (population, 16 million).


RESULTS
The rate of invasive disease dropped from an average of 24.3 cases per 100,000 persons in 1998 and 1999 to 17.3 per 100,000 in 2001. The largest decline was in children under two years of age. In this group, the rate of disease was 69 percent lower in 2001 than the base-line rate (59.0 cases per 100,000 vs. 188.0 per 100,000, P<0.001); the rate of disease caused by vaccine and vaccine-related serotypes declined by 78 percent (P<0.001) and 50 percent (P<0.001), respectively. Disease rates also fell for adults; as compared with base line, the rate of disease in 2001 was 32 percent lower for adults 20 to 39 years of age (7.6 cases per 100,000 vs. 11.2 per 100,000, P<0.001), 8 percent lower for those 40 to 64 years of age (19.7 per 100,000 vs. 21.5 per 100,000, P=0.03), and 18 percent lower for those 65 years of age or more (49.5 per 100,000 vs. 60.1 per 100,000, P<0.001). The rate of disease caused by strains that were not susceptible to penicillin was 35 percent lower in 2001 than in 1999 (4.1 cases per 100,000 vs. 6.3 per 100,000, P<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
The use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is preventing disease in young children, for whom the vaccine is indicated, and may be reducing the rate of disease in adults. The vaccine provides an effective new tool for reducing disease caused by drug-resistant strains."
vaccines,"Significance The majority of influenza vaccine antigens are prepared in chicken eggs. Human vaccine strains grown in eggs often possess adaptive mutations that increase viral attachment to chicken cells. Most of these adaptive mutations are in the hemagglutinin protein, which functions as a viral attachment factor. Here, we identify a hemagglutinin mutation in the current egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain that alters antigenicity. We show that ferrets and humans exposed to the current egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain produce antibodies that poorly neutralize H3N2 viruses that circulated during the 2016–2017 influenza season. These studies highlight the challenges associated with producing influenza vaccine antigens in eggs, while offering a potential explanation of why there was only moderate vaccine effectiveness during the 2016–2017 influenza season. H3N2 viruses continuously acquire mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein that abrogate binding of human antibodies. During the 2014–2015 influenza season, clade 3C.2a H3N2 viruses possessing a new predicted glycosylation site in antigenic site B of HA emerged, and these viruses remain prevalent today. The 2016–2017 seasonal influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3C.2a H3N2 strain; however, the egg-adapted version of this viral strain lacks the new putative glycosylation site. Here, we biochemically demonstrate that the HA antigenic site B of circulating clade 3C.2a viruses is glycosylated. We show that antibodies elicited in ferrets and humans exposed to the egg-adapted 2016–2017 H3N2 vaccine strain poorly neutralize a glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. Importantly, antibodies elicited in ferrets infected with the current circulating H3N2 viral strain (that possesses the glycosylation site) and humans vaccinated with baculovirus-expressed H3 antigens (that possess the glycosylation site motif) were able to efficiently recognize a glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. We propose that differences in glycosylation between H3N2 egg-adapted vaccines and circulating strains likely contributed to reduced vaccine effectiveness during the 2016–2017 influenza season. Furthermore, our data suggest that influenza virus antigens prepared via systems not reliant on egg adaptations are more likely to elicit protective antibody responses that are not affected by glycosylation of antigenic site B of H3N2 HA."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus types 16 (HPV-16) and 18 (HPV-18) cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers worldwide. A phase 3 trial was conducted to evaluate a quadrivalent vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6/11/16/18) for the prevention of high-grade cervical lesions associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 12,167 women between the ages of 15 and 26 years to receive three doses of either HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine or placebo, administered at day 1, month 2, and month 6. The primary analysis was performed for a per-protocol susceptible population that included 5305 women in the vaccine group and 5260 in the placebo group who had no virologic evidence of infection with HPV-16 or HPV-18 through 1 month after the third dose (month 7). The primary composite end point was cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer related to HPV-16 or HPV-18. RESULTS: Subjects were followed for an average of 3 years after receiving the first dose of vaccine or placebo. Vaccine efficacy for the prevention of the primary composite end point was 98% (95.89% confidence interval [CI], 86 to 100) in the per-protocol susceptible population and 44% (95% CI, 26 to 58) in an intention-to-treat population of all women who had undergone randomization (those with or without previous infection). The estimated vaccine efficacy against all high-grade cervical lesions, regardless of causal HPV type, in this intention-to-treat population was 17% (95% CI, 1 to 31). CONCLUSIONS: In young women who had not been previously infected with HPV-16 or HPV-18, those in the vaccine group had a significantly lower occurrence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia related to HPV-16 or HPV-18 than did those in the placebo group."
vaccines,"Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial septicemia and meningitis. Sequence variation of surface-exposed proteins and cross-reactivity of the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide with human tissues have hampered efforts to develop a successful vaccine. To overcome these obstacles, the entire genome sequence of a virulent serogroup B strain (MC58) was used to identify vaccine candidates. A total of 350 candidate antigens were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to immunize mice. The sera allowed the identification of proteins that are surface exposed, that are conserved in sequence across a range of strains, and that induce a bactericidal antibody response, a property known to correlate with vaccine efficacy in humans."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was introduced into the routine immunization schedule in the United States in late 2006 for females aged 11 or 12 years, with catch-up vaccination recommended for those aged 13-26 years. In 2010, 3-dose vaccine coverage was only 32% among 13-17 year-olds. Reduction in the prevalence of HPV types targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine (HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) will be one of the first measures of vaccine impact.


METHODS
We analyzed HPV prevalence data from the vaccine era (2007-2010) and the prevaccine era (2003-2006) that were collected during National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. HPV prevalence was determined by the Linear Array HPV Assay in cervicovaginal swab samples from females aged 14-59 years; 4150 provided samples in 2003-2006, and 4253 provided samples in 2007-2010.


RESULTS
Among females aged 14-19 years, the vaccine-type HPV prevalence (HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18) decreased from 11.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2-14.4) in 2003-2006 to 5.1% (95% CI, 3.8-6.6) in 2007-2010, a decline of 56% (95% CI, 38-69). Among other age groups, the prevalence did not differ significantly between the 2 time periods (P > .05). The vaccine effectiveness of at least 1 dose was 82% (95% CI, 53-93).


CONCLUSIONS
Within 4 years of vaccine introduction, the vaccine-type HPV prevalence decreased among females aged 14-19 years despite low vaccine uptake. The estimated vaccine effectiveness was high."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
A safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a global priority. We tested the efficacy of a DNA prime-recombinant adenovirus type 5 boost (DNA/rAd5) vaccine regimen in persons at increased risk for HIV-1 infection in the United States.


METHODS
At 21 sites, we randomly assigned 2504 men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive the DNA/rAd5 vaccine (1253 participants) or placebo (1251 participants). We assessed HIV-1 acquisition from week 28 through month 24 (termed week 28+ infection), viral-load set point (mean plasma HIV-1 RNA level 10 to 20 weeks after diagnosis), and safety. The 6-plasmid DNA vaccine (expressing clade B Gag, Pol, and Nef and Env proteins from clades A, B, and C) was administered at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The rAd5 vector boost (expressing clade B Gag-Pol fusion protein and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C) was administered at week 24.


RESULTS
In April 2013, the data and safety monitoring board recommended halting vaccinations for lack of efficacy. The primary analysis showed that week 28+ infection had been diagnosed in 27 participants in the vaccine group and 21 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, -25.0%; 95% confidence interval, -121.2 to 29.3; P=0.44), with mean viral-load set points of 4.46 and 4.47 HIV-1 RNA log10 copies per milliliter, respectively. Analysis of all infections during the study period (41 in the vaccine group and 31 in the placebo group) also showed lack of vaccine efficacy (P=0.28). The vaccine regimen had an acceptable side-effect profile.


CONCLUSIONS
The DNA/rAd5 vaccine regimen did not reduce either the rate of HIV-1 acquisition or the viral-load set point in the population studied. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00865566.)."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Induction of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies is a high priority for AIDS vaccine development but one that has proven difficult to be achieved. While most immunogens generate antibodies that neutralize a subset of T-cell-line-adapted strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), none so far have generated a potent, broadly cross-reactive response against primary isolates of the virus. Even small increments in immunogen improvement leading to increases in neutralizing antibody titers and cross-neutralizing activity would accelerate vaccine development; however, a lack of uniformity in target strains used by different investigators to assess cross-neutralization has made the comparison of vaccine-induced antibody responses difficult. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish standard panels of HIV-1 reference strains for wide distribution. To facilitate this, full-length gp160 genes were cloned from acute and early subtype B infections and characterized for use as reference reagents to assess neutralizing antibodies against clade B HIV-1. Individual gp160 clones were screened for infectivity as Env-pseudotyped viruses in a luciferase reporter gene assay in JC53-BL (TZM-bl) cells. Functional env clones were sequenced and their neutralization phenotypes characterized by using soluble CD4, monoclonal antibodies, and serum samples from infected individuals and noninfected recipients of a recombinant gp120 vaccine. Env clones from 12 R5 primary HIV-1 isolates were selected that were not unusually sensitive or resistant to neutralization and comprised a wide spectrum of genetic, antigenic, and geographic diversity. These reference reagents will facilitate proficiency testing and other validation efforts aimed at improving assay performance across laboratories and can be used for standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies."
vaccines,"These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged > or =60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged > or =60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Human papillomavirus types 16 (HPV-16) and 18 (HPV-18) cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers worldwide. A phase 3 trial was conducted to evaluate a quadrivalent vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6/11/16/18) for the prevention of high-grade cervical lesions associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18.


METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 12,167 women between the ages of 15 and 26 years to receive three doses of either HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine or placebo, administered at day 1, month 2, and month 6.

Vaccine efficacy for the prevention of the primary composite end point was 98% (95.89% confidence interval [CI], 86 to 100) in the per-protocol susceptible population and 44% (95% CI, 26 to 58) in an intention-to-treat population of all women who had undergone randomization (those with or without previous infection). The estimated vaccine efficacy against all high-grade cervical lesions, regardless of causal HPV type, in this intention-to-treat population was 17% (95% CI, 1 to 31).


CONCLUSIONS
In young women who had not been previously infected with HPV-16 or HPV-18, those in the vaccine group had a significantly lower occurrence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia related to HPV-16 or HPV-18 than did those in the placebo group.

vaccines,"On June 20, 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.) for adults aged ≥19 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, or cochlear implants. PCV13 should be administered to eligible adults in addition to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax 23, Merck & Co. Inc.), the vaccine currently recommended for these groups of adults. The evidence for the benefits and risk of PCV13 vaccination of adults with immunocompromising conditions was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and designated as a Category A recommendation. This report outlines the new ACIP recommendations for PCV13 use; explains the recommendations for the use of PCV13 and PPSV23 among adults with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, CSF leaks, or cochlear implants; and summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make its recommendations."
vaccines,"A V1-V2 IgG3 response to HIV correlates with a decreased risk of HIV-1 infection and is one vaccine-induced humoral response that is higher in a clinical trial showing HIV-1 vaccine efficacy compared to a trial showing nonefficacy. Env IgG3 Takes Center Stage Only one HIV-1 vaccine trial (RV144), to date, has demonstrated some level of vaccine efficacy. IgG antibodies to the V1-V2 region of the HIV-1 envelope correlated with decreased HIV-1 risk. However, a previous vaccine trial (VAX003) also induced these types of antibodies but failed to demonstrate efficacy, thus raising the question about whether the quality of the V1-V2 IgG response and the context of other immune responses were important. Yates et al. report that these two trials did induce a qualitatively distinct antibody subclass response, with more V1V2 IgG3 responses and correlations with antiviral function induced by the partially efficacious RV144 vaccine regimen compared to the VAX003 vaccine regimen that lacks efficacy. The authors then demonstrated that these specific IgG3 antibodies correlated with a decreased risk of infection in a placebo-controlled, blinded study of RV144 vaccinees with and without subsequent HIV-1 infection. Vaccine-induced HIV-1 antibody subclass profiles, specifically Env IgG3, should be evaluated in future HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials to further refine immune correlates of protection. HIV-1–specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass antibodies bind to distinct cellular Fc receptors. Antibodies of the same epitope specificity but of a different subclass therefore can have different antibody effector functions. The study of IgG subclass profiles between different vaccine regimens used in clinical trials with divergent efficacy outcomes can provide information on the quality of the vaccine-induced B cell response. We show that HIV-1–specific IgG3 distinguished two HIV-1 vaccine efficacy studies (RV144 and VAX003 clinical trials) and correlated with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection in a blinded follow-up case-control study with the RV144 vaccine. HIV-1–specific IgG3 responses were not long-lived, which was consistent with the waning efficacy of the RV144 vaccine. These data suggest that specific vaccine-induced HIV-1 IgG3 should be tested in future studies of immune correlates in HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials."
vaccines,"Background Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is generally interpreted in the context of vaccine match/mismatch to circulating strains with evolutionary drift in the latter invoked to explain reduced protection. During the 2012–13 season, however, detailed genotypic and phenotypic characterization shows that low VE was instead related to mutations in the egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain rather than antigenic drift in circulating viruses. Methods/Findings Component-specific VE against medically-attended, PCR-confirmed influenza was estimated in Canada by test-negative case-control design. Influenza A viruses were characterized genotypically by amino acid (AA) sequencing of established haemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites and phenotypically through haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. H3N2 viruses were characterized in relation to the WHO-recommended, cell-passaged vaccine prototype (A/Victoria/361/2011) as well as the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production. Among the total of 1501 participants, influenza virus was detected in 652 (43%). Nearly two-thirds of viruses typed/subtyped were A(H3N2) (394/626; 63%); the remainder were A(H1N1)pdm09 (79/626; 13%), B/Yamagata (98/626; 16%) or B/Victoria (54/626; 9%). Suboptimal VE of 50% (95%CI: 33–63%) overall was driven by predominant H3N2 activity for which VE was 41% (95%CI: 17–59%). All H3N2 field isolates were HI-characterized as well-matched to the WHO-recommended A/Victoria/361/2011 prototype whereas all but one were antigenically distinct from the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production. The egg-adapted strain was itself antigenically distinct from the WHO-recommended prototype, and bore three AA mutations at antigenic sites B [H156Q, G186V] and D [S219Y]. Conversely, circulating viruses were identical to the WHO-recommended prototype at these positions with other genetic variation that did not affect antigenicity. VE was 59% (95%CI:16–80%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, 67% (95%CI: 30–85%) against B/Yamagata (vaccine-lineage) and 75% (95%CI: 29–91%) against B/Victoria (non-vaccine-lineage) viruses. Conclusions These findings underscore the need to monitor vaccine viruses as well as circulating strains to explain vaccine performance. Evolutionary drift in circulating viruses cannot be regulated, but influential mutations introduced as part of egg-based vaccine production may be amenable to improvements."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative agents of outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina worldwide. This phase 3 trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of an EV71 vaccine.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in which 10,007 healthy infants and young children (6 to 35 months of age) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular doses of either EV71 vaccine or placebo, 28 days apart. The surveillance period was 12 months. The primary end point was the occurrence of EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina.


RESULTS
During the 12-month surveillance period, EV71-associated disease was identified in 0.3% of vaccine recipients (13 of 5041 children) and 2.1% of placebo recipients (106 of 5028 children) in the intention-to-treat cohort. The vaccine efficacy against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina was 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.2 to 97.9; P<0.001) in this cohort. Vaccine efficacies against EV71-associated hospitalization (0 cases vs. 24 cases) and hand, foot, and mouth disease with neurologic complications (0 cases vs. 8 cases) were both 100% (95% CI, 83.7 to 100 and 42.6 to 100, respectively). Serious adverse events occurred in 111 of 5044 children in the vaccine group (2.2%) and 131 of 5033 children in the placebo group (2.6%). In the immunogenicity subgroup (1291 children), an anti-EV71 immune response was elicited by the two-dose vaccine series in 98.8% of participants at day 56. An anti-EV71 neutralizing antibody titer of 1:16 was associated with protection against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina.


CONCLUSIONS
The EV71 vaccine provided protection against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina in infants and young children. (Funded by Sinovac Biotech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01507857.)."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
A vaccine is needed to prevent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.


METHODS
A double-blind, randomized trial of a recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein subunit (rgp120) vaccine was conducted among men who have sex with men and among women at high risk for heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. Volunteers received 7 injections of either vaccine or placebo (ratio, 2 : 1) over 30 months. The primary end point was HIV-1 seroconversion over 36 months.


RESULTS
A total of 5403 volunteers (5095 men and 308 women) were evaluated. The vaccine did not prevent HIV-1 acquisition: infection rates were 6.7% in 3598 vaccinees and 7.0% in 1805 placebo recipients; vaccine efficacy (VE) was estimated as 6% (95% confidence interval, -17% to 24%). There were no significant differences in viral loads, rates of antiretroviral-therapy initiation, or the genetic characteristics of the infecting HIV-1 strains between treatment arms. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed nonsignificant trends toward efficacy in preventing infection in the highest risk (VE, 43%; n=247) and nonwhite (VE, 47%; n=914) volunteers (P=.10, adjusted for multiple subgroup comparisons).


CONCLUSIONS
There was no overall protective effect. The efficacy trends in subgroups may provide clues for the development of effective immunization approaches."
vaccines,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a deadly viral respiratory disease caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective against this viral disease. In addition, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent MERS-CoV infection thus far. Therefore, our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective MERS vaccine. Overall, vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV are mainly based upon the viral spike (S) protein, due to its vital role in the viral infectivity, although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, and non-structural protein 16 (NSP16) have also been reported. In general, the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types: viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, nanoparticle-based vaccine, inactivated-whole virus vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine, which are discussed in detail. Besides, the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of MERS-CoV infection are extensively reviewed. In addition, animal models used to study MERS-CoV and evaluate the vaccine candidates are discussed intensively."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Acute respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children. We evaluated the efficacy of a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a randomized, double-blind study in Soweto, South Africa.


METHODS
At 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, 19,922 children received the 9-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine conjugated to a noncatalytic cross-reacting mutant of diphtheria toxin (CRM197), and 19,914 received placebo. All children received Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine. Efficacy and safety were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.


RESULTS
Among children without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the vaccine reduced the incidence of a first episode of invasive pneumococcal disease due to serotypes included in the vaccine by 83 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 97; 17 cases among controls and 3 among vaccine recipients). Among HIV-infected children, the efficacy was 65 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 24 to 86; 26 and 9 cases, respectively). Among children without HIV infection, the vaccine reduced the incidence of first episodes of radiologically confirmed alveolar consolidation by 20 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 35; 212 cases in the control group and 169 in the vaccinated group) in the intention-to-treat analysis and by 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 41; 158 and 119 cases, respectively) in the per-protocol analysis (i.e., among fully vaccinated children). The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by penicillin-resistant strains was reduced by 67 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 88; 21 cases in the control group and 7 in the vaccinated group), and that caused by strains resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was reduced by 56 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 16 to 78; 32 and 14 cases, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Vaccination with a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reduced the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia. The vaccine also reduced the incidence of vaccine-serotype and antibiotic-resistant invasive pneumococcal disease among children with and those without HIV infection."

Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, among others, provided lists of all known studies. Study Selection. —A total of 1264 articles or abstracts were reviewed for details on BCG vaccination, concurrent vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, and TB outcome; 70 articles were reviewed in depth for method of vaccine allocation used to create comparable groups, equal surveillance and follow-up for recipient and concurrent control groups, and outcome measures of TB cases and/or deaths. Fourteen prospective trials and 12 case-control studies were included in the analysis. Data Extraction. —We recorded study design, age range of study population, number of patients enrolled, efficacy of vaccine, and items to assess the potential for bias in study design and diagnosis. At least two readers independently extracted data and evaluated validity. Data Synthesis. —The relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) of TB provided the measure of vaccine efficacy that we analyzed. The protective effect was then computed by 1 —RR or 1 —OR. A random-effects model estimated a weighted average RR or OR from those provided by the trials or case-control studies. In the trials, the RR of TB was 0.49 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.34 to 0.70) for vaccine recipients compared with nonrecipients (protective effect of 51%). In the case-control studies, the OR for TB was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.64), or a 50% protective effect. Seven trials reporting tuberculous deaths showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 71% (RR, 0.29; 95% Cl, 0.16 to 0.53), and five studies reporting on meningitis showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 64% (OR, 0.36; 95% Cl, 0.18 to 0.70). Geographic latitude of the study site and study validity score explained 66% of the heterogeneity among trials in a random-effects regression model. Conclusion. —On average, BCG vaccine significantly reduces the risk of TB by 50%. Protection is observed across many populations, study designs, and forms of TB. Age at vaccination did not enhance predictiveness of BCG efficacy. Protection against tuberculous death, meningitis, and disseminated disease is higher than for total TB cases, although this result may reflect reduced error in disease classification rather than greater BCG efficacy.

vaccines,"Vaccine protection against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in animal models is proving to be a difficult task. The difficulty is due in large part to the persistent, unrelenting nature of HIV and SIV infection once infection is initiated. SIV with a constructed deletion in the auxiliary gene nef replicates poorly in rhesus monkeys and appears to be nonpathogenic in this normally susceptible host. Rhesus monkeys vaccinated with live SIV deleted in nef were completely protected against challenge by intravenous inoculation of live, pathogenic SIV. Deletion of nef or of multiple genetic elements from HIV may provide the means for creating a safe, effective, live attenuated vaccine to protect against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The impact of the prophylactic vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV6/11/16/18) on all HPV-associated genital disease was investigated in a population that approximates sexually naive women in that they were ""negative to 14 HPV types"" and in a mixed population of HPV-exposed and -unexposed women (intention-to-treat group).


METHODS
This analysis studied 17 622 women aged 15-26 years who were enrolled in one of two randomized, placebo-controlled, efficacy trials for the HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine (first patient on December 28, 2001, and studies completed July 31, 2007). Vaccine or placebo was given at day 1, month 2, and month 6. All women underwent cervicovaginal sampling and Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at day 1 and every 6-12 months thereafter. Outcomes were any cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; any external anogenital and vaginal lesions; Pap test abnormalities; and procedures such as colposcopy and definitive therapy. Absolute rates are expressed as women with endpoint per 100 person-years at risk.


RESULTS
The average follow-up was 3.6 years (maximum of 4.9 years). In the population that was negative to 14 HPV types, vaccination was up to 100% effective in reducing the risk of HPV16/18-related high-grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal lesions and of HPV6/11-related genital warts. In the intention-to-treat group, vaccination also statistically significantly reduced the risk of any high-grade cervical lesions (19.0% reduction; rate vaccine = 1.43, rate placebo = 1.76, difference = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13 to 0.54), vulvar and vaginal lesions (50.7% reduction; rate vaccine = 0.10, rate placebo = 0.20, difference = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.16), genital warts (62.0% reduction; rate vaccine = 0.44, rate placebo = 1.17, difference = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.87), Pap abnormalities (11.3% reduction; rate vaccine = 10.36, rate placebo = 11.68, difference = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.90), and cervical definitive therapy (23.0% reduction; rate vaccine = 1.97, rate placebo = 2.56, difference = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.83), irrespective of causal HPV type.


CONCLUSIONS
High-coverage HPV vaccination programs among adolescents and young women may result in a rapid reduction of genital warts, cervical cytological abnormalities, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In the longer term, substantial reductions in the rates of cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers may follow."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Intussusception is a form of intestinal obstruction in which a segment of the bowel prolapses into a more distal segment. Our investigation began on May 27, 1999, after nine cases of infants who had intussusception after receiving the tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV) were reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.


METHODS
In 19 states, we assessed the potential association between RRV-TV and intussusception among infants at least 1 but less than 12 months old. Infants hospitalized between November 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, were identified by systematic reviews of medical and radiologic records. Each infant with intussusception was matched according to age with four healthy control infants who had been born at the same hospital as the infant with intussusception. Information on vaccinations was verified by the provider.


RESULTS
Data were analyzed for 429 infants with intussusception and 1763 matched controls in a case-control analysis as well as for 432 infants with intussusception in a case-series analysis. Seventy-four of the 429 infants with intussusception (17.2 percent) and 226 of the 1763 controls (12.8 percent) had received RRV-TV (P=0.02). An increased risk of intussusception 3 to 14 days after the first dose of RRV-TV was found in the case-control analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 21.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.6 to 48.9). In the case-series analysis, the incidence-rate ratio was 29.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 16.1 to 53.6) for days 3 through 14 after a first dose. There was also an increase in the risk of intussusception after the second dose of the vaccine, but it was smaller than the increase in risk after the first dose. Assuming full implementation of a national program of vaccination with RRV-TV, we estimated that 1 case of intussusception attributable to the vaccine would occur for every 4670 to 9474 infants vaccinated.


CONCLUSIONS
The strong association between vaccination with RRV-TV and intussusception among otherwise healthy infants supports the existence of a causal relation. Rotavirus vaccines with an improved safety profile are urgently needed."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children and may be fatal. A vaccine against EV71 is needed.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial involving healthy children 6 to 71 months of age in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Two doses of an inactivated EV71 vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly, with a 4-week interval between doses, and children were monitored for up to 11 months. The primary end point was protection against hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV71.


RESULTS
A total of 12,000 children were randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo. Serum neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 549 children who received the vaccine. The seroconversion rate was 100% 4 weeks after the two vaccinations, with a geometric mean titer of 170.6. Over the course of two epidemic seasons, the vaccine efficacy was 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.9 to 99.0) according to the intention-to-treat analysis and 97.3% (95% CI, 92.6 to 99.0) according to the per-protocol analysis. Adverse events, such as fever (which occurred in 41.6% of the participants who received vaccine vs. 35.2% of those who received placebo), were significantly more common in the week after vaccination among children who received the vaccine than among those who received placebo.

The inactivated EV71 vaccine elicited EV71-specific immune responses and protection against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease. (Funded by the National Basic Research Program and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01569581.)."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine targets the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum and has partial protective efficacy against clinical and severe malaria disease in infants and children. We investigated whether the vaccine efficacy was specific to certain parasite genotypes at the circumsporozoite protein locus.


METHODS
We used polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing of DNA extracted from samples from 4985 participants to survey circumsporozoite protein polymorphisms. We evaluated the effect that polymorphic positions and haplotypic regions within the circumsporozoite protein had on vaccine efficacy against first episodes of clinical malaria within 1 year after vaccination.


RESULTS
In the per-protocol group of 4577 RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated participants and 2335 control-vaccinated participants who were 5 to 17 months of age, the 1-year cumulative vaccine efficacy was 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.6 to 62.3) against clinical malaria in which parasites matched the vaccine in the entire circumsporozoite protein C-terminal (139 infections), as compared with 33.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 37.2) against mismatched malaria (1951 infections) (P=0.04 for differential vaccine efficacy). The vaccine efficacy based on the hazard ratio was 62.7% (95% CI, 51.6 to 71.3) against matched infections versus 54.2% (95% CI, 49.9 to 58.1) against mismatched infections (P=0.06). In the group of infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, there was no evidence of differential allele-specific vaccine efficacy.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that among children 5 to 17 months of age, the RTS,S vaccine has greater activity against malaria parasites with the matched circumsporozoite protein allele than against mismatched malaria. The overall vaccine efficacy in this age category will depend on the proportion of matched alleles in the local parasite population; in this trial, less than 10% of parasites had matched alleles.

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
After the introduction of an inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine that was used only in Switzerland, 46 cases of Bell's palsy were reported.


METHODS
We conducted a matched case-control study and a case-series analysis. All primary care physicians, ear, nose, and throat specialists, and neurologists in German-speaking regions of Switzerland were requested to identify cases of Bell's palsy diagnosed in adults between October 1, 2000, and April 30, 2001. Each physician was invited to select three control patients for each patient with Bell's palsy, with matching according to age, date of the clinic visit, and physician. Vaccination information was provided by the physicians.


RESULTS
A total of 773 patients with Bell's palsy were identified. Of the 412 (53.3 percent) who could be evaluated, 250 (60.7 percent) were enrolled and matched with 722 control patients; the other 162 patients had no controls. In the case-control study, we found that 68 patients with Bell's palsy (27.2 percent) and 8 controls (1.1 percent) had received the intranasal vaccine (P<0.001). In contrast to parenteral vaccines, the intranasal vaccine significantly increased the risk of Bell's palsy (adjusted odds ratio, 84.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 20.1 to 351.9). Even according to conservative assumptions, the relative risk of Bell's palsy was estimated to be 19 times the risk in the controls, corresponding to 13 excess cases per 10,000 vaccinees within 1 to 91 days after vaccination. In the case-series analysis, the period of highest risk was 31 to 60 days after vaccination.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests a strong association between the inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine used in Switzerland and Bell's palsy. This vaccine is no longer in clinical use."

An ongoing phase 3 study of the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 is being conducted in seven African countries.


METHODS
From March 2009 through January 2011, we enrolled 15,460 children in two age categories--6 to 12 weeks of age and 5 to 17 months of age--for vaccination with either RTS,S/AS01 or a non-malaria comparator vaccine. The primary end point of the analysis was vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination in the first 6000 children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment who received all three doses of vaccine according to protocol. After 250 children had an episode of severe malaria, we evaluated vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in both age categories.


RESULTS
In the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine, the incidence of first episodes of clinical malaria in the first 6000 children in the older age category was 0.32 episodes per person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 0.55 episodes per person-year in the control group, for an efficacy of 50.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.8 to 54.6) in the intention-to-treat population and 55.8% (97.5% CI, 50.6 to 60.4) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was 45.1% (95% CI, 23.8 to 60.5) in the intention-to-treat population and 47.3% (95% CI, 22.4 to 64.2) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in the combined age categories was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.2 to 49.2) in the per-protocol population during an average follow-up of 11 months. Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups. Among children in the older age category, the rate of generalized convulsive seizures after RTS,S/AS01 vaccination was 1.04 per 1000 doses (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.64).

The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine provided protection against both clinical and severe malaria in African children. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative; RTS,S ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00866619 .)."
vaccines,"Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections have been documented since ancient Greek times. Greek scholars, notably Hippocrates, used the word “herpes,” meaning to creep or crawl, to describe spreading cutaneous lesions. Over the ensuing centuries, the clinical manifestations were described, including a distinction between genital and orofacial herpes, accounting for the designation of HSV-1 and HSV-2. Importantly, these viruses have a unique propensity to establish latency and recur over time, in spite of specific host immune responses, making successful vaccine development a challenge. The spectrum of disease caused by HSV includes primary and recurrent infections of mucous membranes (e.g., gingivostomatitis, herpes labialis, and genital HSV infections), keratoconjunctivitis, neonatal HSV infection, visceral HSV infections of the immunocompromised host, encephalitis, Kaposi varicella-like eruption, and an association with erythema multiforme. As it relates to genital herpes, 22% of the general population is infected with HSV-2, and the seroprevalence is even higher: 30–50% in patients attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics. Here, we will focus on HSV vaccine development with specific reference to translational molecular biology."

In the case-control studies, the OR for TB was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.64), or a 50% protective effect. Seven trials reporting tuberculous deaths showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 71% (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.53), and five studies reporting on meningitis showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 64% (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.70). Geographic latitude of the study site and study validity score explained 66% of the heterogeneity among trials in a random-effects regression model.


CONCLUSION
On average, BCG vaccine significantly reduces the risk of TB by 50%. Protection is observed across many populations, study designs, and forms of TB. Age at vaccination did not enhance predictiveness of BCG efficacy. Protection against tuberculous death, meningitis, and disseminated disease is higher than for total TB cases, although this result may reflect reduced error in disease classification rather than greater BCG efficacy."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
The Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) demonstrated zoster vaccine efficacy through 4 years postvaccination. A Short-Term Persistence Substudy (STPS) demonstrated persistence of vaccine efficacy for at least 5 years. A Long-Term Persistence Substudy (LTPS) was undertaken to further assess vaccine efficacy in SPS vaccine recipients followed for up to 11 years postvaccination. Study outcomes were assessed for the entire LTPS period and for each year from 7 to 11 years postvaccination.


METHODS
Surveillance, case determination, and follow-up were comparable to those in SPS and STPS. Because SPS placebo recipients were offered zoster vaccine before the LTPS began, there were no unvaccinated controls. Instead, SPS and STPS placebo results were used to model reference placebo groups.


RESULTS
The LTPS enrolled 6867 SPS vaccine recipients. Compared to SPS, estimated vaccine efficacy in LTPS decreased from 61.1% to 37.3% for the herpes zoster (HZ) burden of illness (BOI), from 66.5% to 35.4% for incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, and from 51.3% to 21.1% for incidence of HZ, and declined for all 3 outcome measures from 7 through 11 years postvaccination. Vaccine efficacy for the HZ BOI was significantly greater than zero through year 10 postvaccination, whereas vaccine efficacy for incidence of HZ was significantly greater than zero only through year 8.


CONCLUSIONS
Estimates of vaccine efficacy decreased over time in the LTPS population compared with modeled control estimates. Statistically significant vaccine efficacy for HZ BOI persisted into year 10 postvaccination, whereas statistically significant vaccine efficacy for incidence of HZ persisted only through year 8."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Congenital infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important cause of hearing, cognitive, and motor impairments in newborns.


METHODS
In this phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, we evaluated a vaccine consisting of recombinant CMV envelope glycoprotein B with MF59 adjuvant, as compared with placebo. Three doses of the CMV vaccine or placebo were given at 0, 1, and 6 months to CMV-seronegative women within 1 year after they had given birth. We tested for CMV infection in the women in quarterly tests during a 42-month period, using an assay for IgG antibodies against CMV proteins other than glycoprotein B. Infection was confirmed by virus culture or immunoblotting. The primary end point was the time until the detection of CMV infection.


RESULTS
We randomly assigned 234 subjects to receive the CMV vaccine and 230 subjects to receive placebo. A scheduled interim analysis led to a stopping recommendation because of vaccine efficacy. After a minimum of 1 year of follow-up, there were 49 confirmed infections, 18 in the vaccine group and 31 in the placebo group. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the vaccine group was more likely to remain uninfected during a 42-month period than the placebo group (P=0.02). Vaccine efficacy was 50% (95% confidence interval, 7 to 73) on the basis of infection rates per 100 person-years. One congenital infection among infants of the subjects occurred in the vaccine group, and three infections occurred in the placebo group. There were more local reactions (pain, erythema, induration, and warmth) and systemic reactions (chills, arthralgias, and myalgias) in the vaccine group than in the placebo group.


CONCLUSIONS
CMV glycoprotein B vaccine has the potential to decrease incident cases of maternal and congenital CMV infection. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00125502.)"
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Influenzavirus vaccine is used infrequently in healthy children, even though the rates of influenza in this group are high. We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a live attenuated, cold-adapted, trivalent influenzavirus vaccine in children 15 to 71 months old.


METHODS
Two hundred eighty-eight children were assigned to receive one dose of vaccine or placebo given by intranasal spray, and 1314 were assigned to receive two doses approximately 60 days apart. The strains included in the vaccine were antigenically equivalent to those in the inactivated influenzavirus vaccine in use at the time. The subjects were monitored with viral cultures for influenza during the subsequent influenza season. A case of influenza was defined as an illness associated with the isolation of wild-type influenzavirus from respiratory secretions.


RESULTS
The intranasal vaccine was accepted and well tolerated. Among children who were initially seronegative, antibody titers increased by a factor of four in 61 to 96 percent, depending on the influenza strain. Culture-positive influenza was significantly less common in the vaccine group (14 cases among 1070 subjects) than the placebo group (95 cases among 532 subjects). The vaccine efficacy was 93 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88 to 96 percent) against culture-confirmed influenza. Both the one-dose regimen (89 percent efficacy) and the two-dose regimen (94 percent efficacy) were efficacious, and the vaccine was efficacious against both strains of influenza circulating in 1996-1997, A(H3N2) and B. The vaccinated children had significantly fewer febrile illnesses, including 30 percent fewer episodes of febrile otitis media (95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 45 percent; P<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
A live attenuated, cold-adapted influenzavirus vaccine was safe, immunogenic, and effective against influenza A(H3N2) and B in healthy children."
vaccines,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly with type 16, causes a growing fraction of oropharyngeal cancers, whose incidence is increasing, mainly in developed countries. In a double-blind controlled trial conducted to investigate vaccine efficacy (VE) of the bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine against cervical infections and lesions, we estimated VE against prevalent oral HPV infections 4 years after vaccination. Methods and Findings A total of 7,466 women 18–25 years old were randomized (1∶1) to receive the HPV16/18 vaccine or hepatitis A vaccine as control. At the final blinded 4-year study visit, 5,840 participants provided oral specimens (91·9% of eligible women) to evaluate VE against oral infections. Our primary analysis evaluated prevalent oral HPV infection among all vaccinated women with oral and cervical HPV results. Corresponding VE against prevalent cervical HPV16/18 infection was calculated for comparison. Oral prevalence of identifiable mucosal HPV was relatively low (1·7%). Approximately four years after vaccination, there were 15 prevalent HPV16/18 infections in the control group and one in the vaccine group, for an estimated VE of 93·3% (95% CI = 63% to 100%). Corresponding efficacy against prevalent cervical HPV16/18 infection for the same cohort at the same visit was 72·0% (95% CI = 63% to 79%) (p versus oral VE = 0·04). There was no statistically significant protection against other oral HPV infections, though power was limited for these analyses. Conclusions HPV prevalence four years after vaccination with the ASO4-adjuvanted HPV16/18 vaccine was much lower among women in the vaccine arm compared to the control arm, suggesting that the vaccine affords strong protection against oral HPV16/18 infection, with potentially important implications for prevention of increasingly common HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer.

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Two previous studies of a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) subunit vaccine containing glycoprotein D in HSV-discordant couples revealed 73% and 74% efficacy against genital disease in women who were negative for both HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 antibodies. Efficacy was not observed in men or HSV-1 seropositive women.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind efficacy field trial involving 8323 women 18 to 30 years of age who were negative for antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2. At months 0, 1, and 6, some subjects received the investigational vaccine, consisting of 20 μg of glycoprotein D from HSV-2 with alum and 3-O-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A as an adjuvant; control subjects received the hepatitis A vaccine, at a dose of 720 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units. The primary end point was occurrence of genital herpes disease due to either HSV-1 or HSV-2 from month 2 (1 month after dose 2) through month 20.


RESULTS
The HSV vaccine was associated with an increased risk of local reactions as compared with the control vaccine, and it elicited ELISA and neutralizing antibodies to HSV-2. Overall, the vaccine was not efficacious; vaccine efficacy was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], -29 to 50) against genital herpes disease. However, efficacy against HSV-1 genital disease was 58% (95% CI, 12 to 80). Vaccine efficacy against HSV-1 infection (with or without disease) was 35% (95% CI, 13 to 52), but efficacy against HSV-2 infection was not observed (-8%; 95% CI, -59 to 26).


CONCLUSIONS
In a study population that was representative of the general population of HSV-1- and HSV-2-seronegative women, the investigational vaccine was effective in preventing HSV-1 genital disease and infection but not in preventing HSV-2 disease or infection.

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Five of seven serotypes in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, introduced for infants in the United States in 2000, are responsible for most penicillin-resistant infections. We examined the effect of this vaccine on invasive disease caused by resistant strains.


METHODS
We used laboratory-based data from Active Bacterial Core surveillance to measure disease caused by antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococci from 1996 through 2004. Cases of invasive disease, defined as disease caused by pneumococci isolated from a normally sterile site, were identified in eight surveillance areas. Isolates underwent serotyping and susceptibility testing.


RESULTS
Rates of invasive disease caused by penicillin-nonsusceptible strains and strains not susceptible to multiple antibiotics peaked in 1999 and decreased by 2004, from 6.3 to 2.7 cases per 100,000 (a decline of 57 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 55 to 58 percent) and from 4.1 to 1.7 cases per 100,000 (a decline of 59 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 58 to 60 percent), respectively. Among children under two years of age, disease caused by penicillin-nonsusceptible strains decreased from 70.3 to 13.1 cases per 100,000 (a decline of 81 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 80 to 82 percent). Among persons 65 years of age or older, disease caused by penicillin-nonsusceptible strains decreased from 16.4 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 (a decline of 49 percent). Rates of resistant disease caused by vaccine serotypes fell 87 percent. An increase was seen in disease caused by serotype 19A, a serotype not included in the vaccine (from 2.0 to 8.3 per 100,000 among children under two years of age).


CONCLUSIONS
The rate of antibiotic-resistant invasive pneumococcal infections decreased in young children and older persons after the introduction of the conjugate vaccine. There was an increase in infections caused by serotypes not included in the vaccine."
vaccines,"As the global eradication of wild poliovirus nears, the World Health Organization (WHO) is addressing challenges unprecedented in public health. The live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), used for more than four decades to interrupt poliovirus transmission, and the vaccine of choice for developing countries, is genetically unstable. Reversion of the small number of substitutions conferring the attenuated phenotype frequently occurs during OPV replication in humans and is the underlying cause of the rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in OPV recipients and their close contacts. Whereas VAPP has long been recognized, two other adverse events have been identified more recently: (a) long-term excretion of highly evolved vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) in persons with primary immunodeficiencies, and (b) polio outbreaks associated with circulating VDPVs in areas with low rates of OPV coverage. Developing a posteradication strategy to minimize the risks of VDPV emergence and spread has become an urgent WHO priority."
vaccines,"Voluntary vaccination policies for childhood diseases present parents with a subtle challenge: if a sufficient proportion of the population is already immune, either naturally or by vaccination, then even the slightest risk associated with vaccination will outweigh the risk from infection. As a result, individual self-interest might preclude complete eradication of a vaccine-preventable disease. We show that a formal game theoretical analysis of this problem leads to new insights that help to explain human decision-making with respect to vaccination. Increases in perceived vaccine risk will tend to induce larger declines in vaccine uptake for pathogens that cause more secondary infections (such as measles and pertussis). After a vaccine scare, even if perceived vaccine risk is greatly reduced, it will be relatively difficult to restore prescare vaccine coverage levels."
vaccines,"Meningitis and sepsis caused by serogroup B meningococcus are two severe diseases that still cause significant mortality. To date there is no universal vaccine that prevents these diseases. In this work, five antigens discovered by reverse vaccinology were expressed in a form suitable for large-scale manufacturing and formulated with adjuvants suitable for human use. The vaccine adjuvanted by aluminum hydroxide induced bactericidal antibodies in mice against 78% of a panel of 85 meningococcal strains representative of the global population diversity. The strain coverage could be increased to 90% and above by the addition of CpG oligonucleotides or by using MF59 as adjuvant. The vaccine has the potential to conquer one of the most devastating diseases of childhood."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Noroviruses cause epidemic and sporadic acute gastroenteritis. No vaccine is available to prevent norovirus illness or infection.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of an investigational, intranasally delivered norovirus viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine (with chitosan and monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvants) to prevent acute viral gastroenteritis after challenge with a homologous viral strain, Norwalk virus (genotype GI.1). Healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age received two doses of either vaccine or placebo and were subsequently inoculated with Norwalk virus and monitored for infection and gastroenteritis symptoms.


RESULTS
Ninety-eight persons were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive vaccine (50 participants) or placebo (48 participants), and 90 received both doses (47 participants in the vaccine group and 43 in the placebo group). The most commonly reported symptoms after vaccination were nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, and sneezing. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency among vaccine and placebo recipients. A Norwalk virus-specific IgA seroresponse (defined as an increase by a factor of 4 in serum antibody levels) was detected in 70% of vaccine recipients. Seventy-seven of 84 participants inoculated with Norwalk virus were included in the per-protocol analysis. Vaccination significantly reduced the frequencies of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis (occurring in 69% of placebo recipients vs. 37% of vaccine recipients, P=0.006) and Norwalk virus infection (82% of placebo recipients vs. 61% of vaccine recipients, P=0.05).

This norovirus VLP vaccine provides protection against illness and infection after challenge with a homologous virus. (Funded by LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals and the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00973284.)."
vaccines,"ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important emerging virus that is highly pathogenic in aged populations and is maintained with great diversity in zoonotic reservoirs. While a variety of vaccine platforms have shown efficacy in young-animal models and against homologous viral strains, vaccine efficacy has not been thoroughly evaluated using highly pathogenic variants that replicate the acute end stage lung disease phenotypes seen during the human epidemic. Using an adjuvanted and an unadjuvanted double-inactivated SARS-CoV (DIV) vaccine, we demonstrate an eosinophilic immunopathology in aged mice comparable to that seen in mice immunized with the SARS nucleocapsid protein, and poor protection against a nonlethal heterologous challenge. In young and 1-year-old animals, we demonstrate that adjuvanted DIV vaccine provides protection against lethal disease in young animals following homologous and heterologous challenge, although enhanced immune pathology and eosinophilia are evident following heterologous challenge. In the absence of alum, DIV vaccine performed poorly in young animals challenged with lethal homologous or heterologous strains. In contrast, DIV vaccines (both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted) performed poorly in aged-animal models. Importantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication. These data raise significant concerns regarding DIV vaccine safety and highlight the need for additional studies of the molecular mechanisms governing DIV-induced eosinophilia and vaccine failure, especially in the more vulnerable aged-animal models of human disease."
vaccines,"CONTEXT
With routine childhood vaccination using heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, one concern has been the potential for emergence and expansion of replacement disease caused by serotypes not contained in the heptavalent conjugate vaccine.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether replacement disease is associated with the overall decline in invasive pneumococcal disease among Alaska Native children.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS
Alaska statewide longitudinal population-based laboratory surveillance of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2006.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Incidence and types of pneumococcal disease in children younger than 2 years.


RESULTS
In the first 3 years after introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, overall invasive pneumococcal disease decreased 67% in Alaska Native children younger than 2 years (from 403.2 per 100,000 in 1995-2000 to 134.3 per 100,000 per year in 2001-2003, P<.001). However, between 2001-2003 and 2004-2006, there was an 82% increase in invasive disease in Alaska Native children younger than 2 years to 244.6/100,000 (P = .02). Since 2004, the invasive pneumococcal disease rate caused by nonvaccine serotypes has increased 140% compared with the prevaccine period (from 95.1 per 100,000 in 1995-2000 to 228.6 in 2004-2006, P = .001). During the same period, there was a 96% decrease in heptavalent vaccine serotype disease. Serotype 19A accounted for 28.3% of invasive pneumococcal disease among Alaska children younger than 2 years during 2004-2006. There was no significant increase in nonvaccine disease in non-Native Alaska children younger than 2 years.


CONCLUSIONS
Alaska Native children are experiencing replacement invasive pneumococcal disease with serotypes not covered by heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The demonstration of replacement invasive pneumococcal disease emphasizes the importance of ongoing surveillance and development of expanded valency vaccines."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Young infants and pregnant women are at increased risk for serious consequences of influenza infection. Inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for pregnant women but is not licensed for infants younger than 6 months of age. We assessed the clinical effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine administered during pregnancy in Bangladesh.


METHODS
In this randomized study, we assigned 340 mothers to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine (influenza-vaccine group) or the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (control group). Mothers were interviewed weekly to assess illnesses until 24 weeks after birth. Subjects with febrile respiratory illness were assessed clinically, and ill infants were tested for influenza antigens. We estimated the incidence of illness, incidence rate ratios, and vaccine effectiveness.


RESULTS
Mothers and infants were observed from August 2004 through December 2005. Among infants of mothers who received influenza vaccine, there were fewer cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza than among infants in the control group (6 cases and 16 cases, respectively), with a vaccine effectiveness of 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5 to 85). Respiratory illness with fever occurred in 110 infants in the influenza-vaccine group and 153 infants in the control group, with a vaccine effectiveness of 29% (95% CI, 7 to 46). Among the mothers, there was a reduction in the rate of respiratory illness with fever of 36% (95% CI, 4 to 57).


CONCLUSIONS
Inactivated influenza vaccine reduced proven influenza illness by 63% in infants up to 6 months of age and averted approximately a third of all febrile respiratory illnesses in mothers and young infants. Maternal influenza immunization is a strategy with substantial benefits for both mothers and infants. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00142389.)"
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Reliable estimates of the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among persons 65 years of age and older are important for informed vaccination policies and programs. Short-term studies may provide misleading pictures of long-term benefits, and residual confounding may have biased past results. This study examined the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in seniors over the long term while addressing potential bias and residual confounding in the results.


METHODS
Data were pooled from 18 cohorts of community-dwelling elderly members of one U.S. health maintenance organization (HMO) for 1990-1991 through 1999-2000 and of two other HMOs for 1996-1997 through 1999-2000. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and death after adjustment for important covariates. Additional analyses explored for evidence of bias and the potential effect of residual confounding.


RESULTS
There were 713,872 person-seasons of observation. Most high-risk medical conditions that were measured were more prevalent among vaccinated than among unvaccinated persons. Vaccination was associated with a 27% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.77) and a 48% reduction in the risk of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.55). Estimates were generally stable across age and risk subgroups. In the sensitivity analyses, we modeled the effect of a hypothetical unmeasured confounder that would have caused overestimation of vaccine effectiveness in the main analysis; vaccination was still associated with statistically significant--though lower--reductions in the risks of both hospitalization and death.


CONCLUSIONS
During 10 seasons, influenza vaccination was associated with significant reductions in the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and in the risk of death among community-dwelling elderly persons. Vaccine delivery to this high-priority group should be improved."

vaccines,"CONTEXT
A conjugate vaccine targeting 7 pneumococcal serotypes was licensed for young children in 2000. In contrast to the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine used in adults, the 7-valent conjugate vaccine affects pneumococcal carriage and transmission. Early after its introduction, incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease declined among older adults, a group at high risk for pneumococcal disease.


OBJECTIVE
To determine among adults aged 50 years or older whether incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, disease characteristics, or the spectrum of patients acquiring these illnesses have changed over the 4 years since pneumococcal conjugate vaccine licensure.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION
Population-based surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in 8 US geographic areas (total population, 18,813,000), 1998-2003.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease by pneumococcal serotype and other characteristics; frequency among case patients of comorbid conditions and other factors influencing mortality.


RESULTS
Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among adults aged 50 years or older declined 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], -31% to -24%), from 40.8 cases/100,000 in 1998-1999 to 29.4 in 2002-2003. Among those aged 65 years or older, the 2002-2003 rate (41.7 cases/100,000) was lower than the Healthy People 2010 goal (42 cases/100,000). Among adults aged 50 years or older, incidence of disease caused by the 7 conjugate vaccine serotypes declined 55% (95% CI, -58% to -51%) from 22.4 to 10.2 cases/100,000. In contrast, disease caused by any of the 16 serotypes only in polysaccharide vaccine did not change, and disease caused by serotypes not in either vaccine increased somewhat, from 6.0 to 6.8 cases/100,000 (13%; 95% CI, 1% to 27%). Between 1998-1999 and 2002-2003, the proportion of case-patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection increased from 1.7% (47/2737) to 5.6% (124/2231) (P<.001), and those with any comorbid condition that is an indication for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination increased from 62.3% (1842/2955) to 72.0% (1721/2390) (P<.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that use of conjugate vaccine in children has substantially benefited older adults. However, persons with certain comorbid conditions may benefit less than healthier persons from the indirect effects of the new vaccine."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Although the protective efficacy of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been demonstrated in randomized trials in young African gold miners, there has been controversy about its efficacy in older Americans at risk for serious pneumococcal infections. To assess the vaccine's protective efficacy against invasive pneumococcal infections, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine in adults with a condition recognized to be an indication for receiving the vaccine.


METHODS
From 1984 to 1990, adults in whom Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from any normally sterile site were identified by prospective surveillance in the microbiology laboratories of 11 large hospitals; those with an indication for pneumococcal vaccine were enrolled as case patients. For each case patient, one control was matched according to age, underlying illness, and site of hospitalization. We contacted all providers of medical care to ascertain each subject's history of immunization with pneumococcal vaccine. Isolates of S. pneumoniae were serotyped by an investigator unaware of the subject's vaccination history.


RESULTS
Thirteen percent of the 1,054 case patients and 20 percent of the 1,054 matched controls had received pneumococcal vaccine (P less than 0.001). When vaccine was given in either its 14-valent or its 23-valent form, its aggregate protective efficacy (calculated as a percentage: 1 minus the odds ratio of having been vaccinated times 100) against infections caused by the serotypes represented in the vaccine was 56 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 42 percent to 67 percent; P less than 0.00001) for all 983 patients infected with a serotype represented in the vaccine, 61 percent for a subgroup of 808 immunocompetent patients (95 percent confidence interval, 47 percent to 72 percent; P less than 0.00001), and 21 percent for a subgroup of 175 immunocompromised patients (95 percent confidence interval, -55 percent to 60 percent; P = 0.48). The vaccine was not efficacious against infections caused by serotypes not represented in the vaccine (protective efficacy, -73 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -263 percent to 18 percent; P = 0.15).


CONCLUSIONS
Polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine is efficacious in preventing invasive pneumococcal infections in immunocompetent patients with indications for its administration. This vaccine should be used more widely."
vaccines,"In January 2005, a tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine ([MCV4] Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) was licensed for use among persons aged 11-55 years. CDCns Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of young adolescents (defined in this report as persons aged 11-12 years) with MCV4 at the preadolescent health-care visit (at age 11-12 years). Introducing a recommendation for MCV4 vaccination among young adolescents might strengthen the role of the preadolescent visit and have a positive effect on vaccine coverage among adolescents. For those persons who have not previously received MCV4, ACIP recommends vaccination before high-school entry (at approximately age 15 years) as an effective strategy to reduce meningococcal disease incidence among adolescents and young adults. By 2008, the goal will be routine vaccination with MCV4 of all adolescents beginning at age 11 years. Routine vaccination with meningococcal vaccine also is recommended for college freshmen living in dormitories and for other populations at increased risk (i.e., military recruits, travelers to areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, and patients with terminal complement deficiency). Other adolescents, college students, and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus who wish to decrease their risk for meningococcal disease may elect to receive vaccine.

National vaccine recommendations in the United States target an increasing number of vaccine-preventable diseases for reduction, elimination, or eradication.


OBJECTIVE
To compare morbidity and mortality before and after widespread implementation of national vaccine recommendations for 13 vaccine-preventable diseases for which recommendations were in place prior to 2005.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
For the United States, prevaccine baselines were assessed based on representative historical data from primary sources and were compared to the most recent morbidity (2006) and mortality (2004) data for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella (including congenital rubella syndrome), invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), acute hepatitis B, hepatitis A, varicella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and smallpox.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Number of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations for 13 vaccine-preventable diseases. Estimates of the percent reductions from baseline to recent were made without adjustment for factors that could affect vaccine-preventable disease morbidity, mortality, or reporting.


RESULTS
A greater than 92% decline in cases and a 99% or greater decline in deaths due to diseases prevented by vaccines recommended before 1980 were shown for diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, and tetanus. Endemic transmission of poliovirus and measles and rubella viruses has been eliminated in the United States; smallpox has been eradicated worldwide. Declines were 80% or greater for cases and deaths of most vaccine-preventable diseases targeted since 1980 including hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, Hib, and varicella. Declines in cases and deaths of invasive S pneumoniae were 34% and 25%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The number of cases of most vaccine-preventable diseases is at an all-time low; hospitalizations and deaths have also shown striking decreases."
vaccines,"We estimated the possible effects of the next influenza pandemic in the United States and analyzed the economic impact of vaccine-based interventions. Using death rates, hospitalization data, and outpatient visits, we estimated 89,000 to 207,000 deaths; 314,000 to 734,000 hospitalizations; 18 to 42 million outpatient visits; and 20 to 47 million additional illnesses. Patients at high risk (15% of the population) would account for approximately 84% of all deaths. The estimated economic impact would be US$71.3 to $166.5 billion, excluding disruptions to commerce and society. At $21 per vaccinee, we project a net savings to society if persons in all age groups are vaccinated. At $62 per vaccinee and at gross attack rates of 25%, we project net losses if persons not at high risk for complications are vaccinated. Vaccinating 60% of the population would generate the highest economic returns but may not be possible within the time required for vaccine effectiveness, especially if two doses of vaccine are required."
vaccines,Heterologous prime/boost regimens have the potential for raising high levels of immune responses. Here we report that DNA priming followed by a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) booster controlled a highly pathogenic immunodeficiency virus challenge in a rhesus macaque model. Both the DNA and rMVA components of the vaccine expressed multiple immunodeficiency virus proteins. Two DNA inoculations at 0 and 8 weeks and a single rMVA booster at 24 weeks effectively controlled an intrarectal challenge administered 7 months after the booster. These findings provide hope that a relatively simple multiprotein DNA/MVA vaccine can help to control the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic.

Although the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of influenza vaccination are well established for persons aged 65 years or older, the benefits for healthy adults younger than 65 years are less clear.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-benefit of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza-like illness (ILI) and reducing societal costs of ILI among healthy working adults.


DESIGN
Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted during 2 influenza seasons.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
Healthy adults aged 18 to 64 years and employed full-time by a US manufacturing company (for 1997-1998 season, n = 1184; for 1998-1999 season, n = 1191).


INTERVENTIONS
For each season, participants were randomly assigned to receive either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (n = 595 in 1997-1998 and n = 587 in 1998-1999) or sterile saline injection (placebo; n = 589 in 1997-1998 and n = 604 in 1998-1999). Participants in 1997-1998 were rerandomized if they participated in 1998-1999.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Influenza-like illnesses and associated physician visits and work absenteeism reported in biweekly questionnaires by all participants, and serologically confirmed influenza illness among 23% of participants in each year (n = 275 in 1997-1998; n = 278 in 1998-1999); societal cost of ILI per vaccinated vs unvaccinated person.


RESULTS
For 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, respectively, 95% (1130/1184) and 99% (1178/1191) of participants had complete follow-up, and 23% in each year had serologic testing. In 1997-1998, when the vaccine virus differed from the predominant circulating viruses, vaccine efficacy against serologically confirmed influenza illness was 50% (P =.33). In this season, vaccination did not reduce ILI, physician visits, or lost workdays; the net societal cost was $65.59 per person compared with no vaccination. In 1998-1999, the vaccine and predominant circulating viruses were well matched. Vaccine efficacy was 86% (P =.001), and vaccination reduced ILI, physician visits, and lost workdays by 34%, 42%, and 32%, respectively. However, vaccination resulted in a net societal cost of $11.17 per person compared with no vaccination.


CONCLUSION
Influenza vaccination of healthy working adults younger than 65 years can reduce the rates of ILI, lost workdays, and physician visits during years when the vaccine and circulating viruses are similar, but vaccination may not provide overall economic benefits in most years.

vaccines,"BACKGROUND
A novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus is responsible for the first influenza pandemic in 41 years. A safe and effective vaccine is needed. A randomized, observer-blind, parallel-group trial evaluating two doses of an inactivated, split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine in healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years is ongoing at a single site in Australia.


METHODS
We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine after each of two scheduled doses, administered 21 days apart. A total of 240 subjects, equally divided into two age groups (<50 years and >or=50 years), were enrolled and underwent randomization to receive either 15 microg or 30 microg of hemagglutinin antigen by intramuscular injection. We measured antibody titers using hemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralization assays at baseline and 21 days after vaccination. The coprimary immunogenicity end points were the proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 1:40 or more on hemagglutination-inhibition assay, the proportion of subjects with either seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer, and the factor increase in the geometric mean titer.


RESULTS
By day 21 after the first dose, antibody titers of 1:40 or more were observed in 114 of 120 subjects (95.0%) who received the 15-microg dose and in 106 of 119 subjects (89.1%) who received the 30-microg dose. A similar result was observed after the second dose of vaccine. No deaths, serious adverse events, or adverse events of special interest were reported. Local discomfort (e.g., injection-site tenderness or pain) was reported by 56.3% of subjects, and systemic symptoms (e.g., headache) by 53.8% of subjects after each dose. Nearly all events were mild to moderate in intensity.


CONCLUSIONS
A single 15-microg dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in adults, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00938639)."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the chief cause of pneumonia in older adults, but it remains unclear whether use of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine alters the overall risk of community-acquired pneumonia. In a large population of older adults, we assessed the effectiveness of the pneumococcal vaccine.


METHODS
In this retrospective cohort study, 47,365 Group Health Cooperative members 65 years of age or older were assessed over a three-year period. The primary outcomes were hospitalization because of community-acquired pneumonia (validated by chart review), pneumonia in patients who were not hospitalized (""outpatient pneumonia,"" determined from administrative data sources), and pneumococcal bacteremia. The association between pneumococcal vaccination and the risk of each outcome was evaluated by means of multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, with adjustment for age, sex, nursing-home residence or nonresidence, smoking status, medical conditions, and receipt or nonreceipt of influenza vaccine.


RESULTS
During the study period, 1428 cohort members were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, 3061 were assigned a diagnosis of outpatient pneumonia, and 61 had pneumococcal bacteremia. Receipt of the pneumococcal vaccine was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumococcal bacteremia (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.93) but a slightly increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.28). Pneumococcal vaccination did not alter the risk of outpatient pneumonia (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.13) or of any case of community-acquired pneumonia, whether or not it required hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14).


CONCLUSIONS
These findings support the effectiveness of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for the prevention of bacteremia, but they suggest that alternative strategies are needed to prevent nonbacteremic pneumonia, which is a more common manifestation of pneumococcal infection in elderly persons."
vaccines,"CONTEXT
Data are limited and conflicting regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in health care professionals.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the effectiveness of trivalent influenza vaccine in reducing infection, illness, and absence from work in young, healthy health care professionals.


DESIGN
Randomized, prospective, double-blind, controlled trial over 3 consecutive years, from 1992-1993 to 1994-1995.


SETTING
Two large teaching hospitals in Baltimore, Md.


PARTICIPANTS
Two hundred sixty-four hospital-based health care professionals without chronic medical problems were recruited; 49 participated for 2 seasons; 24 participated for 3 seasons. The mean age was 28.4 years, 75% were resident physicians, and 57% were women.


INTERVENTION
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either an influenza vaccine or a control (meningococcal vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, or placebo). Serum samples for antibody assays were collected at the time of vaccination, 1 month after vaccination, and at the end of the influenza season. Active weekly surveillance for illness was conducted during each influenza epidemic period.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Serologically defined influenza infection (4-fold increase in hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies), days of febrile respiratory illness, and days absent from work.


RESULTS
We conducted 359 person-winters of serologic surveillance (99.4% follow-up) and 4746 person-weeks of illness surveillance (100% follow-up). Twenty-four(13.4%) of 179 control subjects and 3 (1.7%) of 180 influenza vaccine recipients had serologic evidence of influenza type A or B infection during the study period. Vaccine efficacy against serologically defined infection was 88% for influenza A (95% confidence interval [CI], 47%-97%; P=.001) and 89% for influenza B (95% CI, 14%-99%; P=.03). Among influenza vaccinees, cumulative days of reported febrile respiratory illness were 28.7 per 100 subjects compared with 40.6 per 100 subjects in controls (P=.57) and days of absence were 9.9 per 100 subjects vs 21.1 per 100 subjects in controls (P=.41).


CONCLUSIONS
Influenza vaccine is effective in preventing infection by influenza A and B in health care professionals and may reduce reported days of work absence and febrile respiratory illness. These data support a policy of annual influenza vaccination of health care professionals."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Studies in animal models have shown that systemic immunization with a papillomavirus virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine composed of L1, a major structural viral protein, can confer protection against subsequent experimental challenge with the homologous virus. Here we report results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 (HPV16) L1 VLP vaccine in healthy adults.


METHODS
Volunteers were given intramuscular injections with placebo or with 10- or 50-microg doses of HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine given without adjuvant or with alum or MF59 as adjuvants at 0, 1, and 4 months. All vaccine recipients were monitored for clinical signs and symptoms for 7 days after each inoculation. Immune responses were measured by an HPV16 L1 VLP-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by an HPV16 pseudovirion neutralization assay. The antibody titers were given as the reciprocals of the highest dilution showing positive reactivity in each assay. All statistical tests were two-sided.


RESULTS
The prevaccination geometric mean ELISA titer for six seropositive individuals was 202 (range, 40--640). All vaccine formulations were well tolerated, and all subjects receiving vaccine seroconverted. Serum antibody responses at 1 month after the third injection were dose dependent in recipients of vaccine without adjuvant or with MF59 but were similar at both doses when alum was the adjuvant. With the higher dose, the geometric means of serum ELISA antibody titers (95% confidence intervals) to purified VLP 1 month after the third injection were as follows: 10,240 (1499 to 69 938) without adjuvant, 10,240 (1114 to 94 145) with MF59, and 2190 (838 to 5723) with alum. Responses of subjects within each group were similar. Neutralizing and ELISA antibody titers were highly correlated (Spearman correlation =.85), confirming that ELISA titers are valid proxies for neutralizing antibodies.


CONCLUSIONS
The HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine is well tolerated and is highly immunogenic even without adjuvant, with the majority of the recipients achieving serum antibody titers that were approximately 40-fold higher than what is observed in natural infection."
vaccines,"The tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was equipped with the membrane-perforating listeriolysin (Hly) of Listeria monocytogenes, which was shown to improve protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Following aerosol challenge, the Hly-secreting recombinant BCG (hly+ rBCG) vaccine was shown to protect significantly better against aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis than did the parental BCG strain. The isogenic, urease C-deficient hly+ rBCG (DeltaureC hly+ rBCG) vaccine, providing an intraphagosomal pH closer to the acidic pH optimum for Hly activity, exhibited still higher vaccine efficacy than parental BCG. DeltaureC hly+ rBCG also induced profound protection against a member of the M. tuberculosis Beijing/W genotype family while parental BCG failed to do so consistently. Hly not only promoted antigen translocation into the cytoplasm but also apoptosis of infected macrophages. We concluded that superior vaccine efficacy of DeltaureC hly+ rBCG as compared with parental BCG is primarily based on improved cross-priming, which causes enhanced T cell-mediated immunity."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of viral hepatitis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of an HEV recombinant protein (rHEV) vaccine in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.


METHODS
In Nepal, we studied 2000 healthy adults susceptible to HEV infection who were randomly assigned to receive three doses of either the rHEV vaccine or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6. Active (including hospital) surveillance was used to identify acute hepatitis and adverse events. The primary end point was the development of hepatitis E after three vaccine doses.


RESULTS
A total of 1794 subjects (898 in the vaccine group and 896 in the placebo group) received three vaccine doses; the total vaccinated cohort was followed for a median of 804 days. After three vaccine doses, hepatitis E developed in 69 subjects, of whom 66 were in the placebo group. The vaccine efficacy was 95.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.6 to 98.6). In an intention-to-treat analysis that included all 87 subjects in whom hepatitis E developed after the first vaccine dose, 9 subjects were in the vaccine group, with a vaccine efficacy of 88.5% (95% CI, 77.1 to 94.2). Among subjects in a subgroup randomly selected for analysis of injection-site findings and general symptoms (reactogenicity subgroup) during the 8-day period after the administration of any dose, the proportion of subjects with adverse events was similar in the two study groups, except that injection-site pain was increased in the vaccine group (P=0.03).


CONCLUSIONS
In a high-risk population, the rHEV vaccine was effective in the prevention of hepatitis E. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00287469 [ClinicalTrials.gov].)."
vaccines,"BACKGROUND
An effective prophylactic vaccine would help control the spread of genital herpes.


METHODS
We conducted two double-blind, randomized trials of a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein-D-subunit vaccine with alum and 3-O-deacylated-monophosphoryl lipid A in subjects whose regular sexual partners had a history of genital herpes. In Study 1, subjects were seronegative for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2; in Study 2, subjects were of any HSV serologic status. At months 0, 1, and 6, subjects received either vaccine or a control injection and were evaluated for 19 months. The primary end point was the occurrence of genital herpes disease in all subjects in Study 1 and in HSV-2-seronegative female subjects in Study 2.


RESULTS
A total of 847 subjects who were seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 (268 of them women, in Study 1) and 1867 subjects who were seronegative for HSV-2 (710 of them women, in Study 2) underwent randomization and received injections. Vaccination was well tolerated and elicited humoral and cellular responses. Overall, the efficacy of the vaccine was 38 percent in Study 1 (95 percent confidence interval, -18 to 68 percent; 15 cases occurred in the vaccine group and 24 in the control group), and efficacy in female subjects was 42 percent in Study 2 (95 percent confidence interval, -31 to 74 percent; 9 cases occurred in the vaccine group and 16 in the control group). In both studies, further analysis showed that the vaccine was efficacious in women who were seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2: efficacy in Study 1 was 73 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 91 percent; P=0.01), and efficacy in Study 2 was 74 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 93 percent; P=0.02). It was not efficacious in women who were seropositive for HSV-1 and seronegative for HSV-2 at base line or in men.


CONCLUSIONS
These studies suggest that the glycoprotein D vaccine has efficacy against genital herpes in women who are seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 at base line but not in those who are seropositive for HSV-1 and seronegative for HSV-2. It had no efficacy in men, regardless of their HSV serologic status."
vaccines,"A DNA-based vaccine containing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env and rev genes was tested for safety and host immune response in 15 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients who were not using antiviral drugs and who had CD4+ lymphocyte counts of > or = 500 per microliter of blood. Successive groups received three doses of vaccine (30, 100, or 300 microg) at 10-week intervals in a dose-escalation trial. Vaccine administration induced no local or systemic reactions, and no laboratory abnormalities were detected. Specifically, no patient developed anti-DNA antibody or muscle enzyme elevations. No consistent change occurred in CD4 or CD8 lymphocyte counts or in plasma HIV concentration. Antibody against gp120 increased in individual patients in the 100- and 300-/microg groups. Some increases were noted in cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against gp160-bearing targets and in lymphocyte proliferative activity. The safety and potential immunogenicity of an HIV-directed DNA-based vaccine was demonstrated, a finding that should encourage further studies."
vaccines,"Summary.  This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study evaluated whether lamivudine given during late pregnancy can reduce hepatitis B virus (HBV) perinatal transmission in highly viraemic mothers. Mothers were randomized to either lamivudine 100 mg or placebo from week 32 of gestation to week 4 postpartum. At birth, infants received recombinant HBV vaccine with or without HBIg and were followed until week 52. One hundred and fifty mothers, with a gestational age of 26–30 weeks and serum HBV DNA >1000 MEq/mL (bDNA assay), were treated. A total of 141 infants received immunoprophylaxis at birth. In lamivudine‐treated mothers, 56 infants received vaccine + HBIg (lamivudine + vaccine + HBIg) and 26 infants received vaccine (lamivudine + vaccine). In placebo‐treated mothers, 59 infants received vaccine + HBIg (placebo + vaccine + HBIg). At week 52, in the primary analyses where missing data was counted as failures, infants in the lamivudine + vaccine + HBIg group had a significant decrease in incidence of HBsAg seropositivity (10/56, 18%vs 23/59, 39%; P = 0.014) and in detectable HBV DNA (11/56, 20%vs 27/59, 46%; P = 0.003) compared to infants in the placebo + vaccine + HBIg group. Sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of missing data at week 52 resulting from a high dropout rate (13% in the lamivudine + vaccine + HBIg group and 31% in the placebo + vaccine + HBIg group) remained consistent with the primary analysis in that lower transmission rates were still observed in the infants of lamivudine‐treated mothers, but the differences were not statistically significant. No safety concerns were noted in the lamivudine‐treated mothers or their infants. Results of this study suggest that lamivudine reduced HBV transmission from highly viraemic mothers to their infants who received passive/active immunization."
vaccines,"Objectives To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of the human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent vaccine in preventing low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias and anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata). Design Data from two international, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised efficacy trials of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (protocol 013 (FUTURE I) and protocol 015 (FUTURE II)). The trials were to be 4 years in length, and the results reported are from final study data of 42 months’ follow-up. Setting Primary care centres and university or hospital associated health centres in 24 countries and territories around the world. Participants 17 622 women aged 16-26 years enrolled between December 2001 and May 2003. Major exclusion criteria were lifetime number of sexual partners (>4), history of abnormal cervical smear test results, and pregnancy. Intervention Three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (for serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18) or placebo at day 1, month 2, and month 6. Main outcome measures Vaccine efficacy against cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I and condyloma in a per protocol susceptible population that included subjects who received all three vaccine doses, tested negative for the relevant vaccine HPV types at day 1 and remained negative through month 7, and had no major protocol violations. Intention to treat, generally HPV naive, and unrestricted susceptible populations were also studied. Results In the per protocol susceptible population, vaccine efficacy against lesions related to the HPV types in the vaccine was 96% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (95% confidence interval 91% to 98%), 100% for both vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (95% CIs 74% to 100%, 64% to 100% respectively), and 99% for condyloma (96% to 100%). Vaccine efficacy against any lesion (regardless of HPV type) in the generally naive population was 30% (17% to 41%), 75% (22% to 94%), and 48% (10% to 71%) for cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, respectively, and 83% (74% to 89%) for condyloma. Conclusions Quadrivalent HPV vaccine provided sustained protection against low grade lesions attributable to vaccine HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18) and a substantial reduction in the burden of these diseases through 42 months of follow-up.

vaccines,"CONTEXT
Children and adolescents appear to play an important role in the transmission of influenza. Selectively vaccinating youngsters against influenza may interrupt virus transmission and protect those not immunized.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether vaccinating children and adolescents with inactivated influenza vaccine could prevent influenza in other community members.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A cluster randomized trial involving 947 Canadian children and adolescents aged 36 months to 15 years who received study vaccine and 2326 community members who did not receive the study vaccine in 49 Hutterite colonies in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Follow-up began December 28, 2008, and ended June 23, 2009.


INTERVENTION
Children were randomly assigned according to community and in a blinded manner to receive standard dosing of either inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine or hepatitis A vaccine, which was used as a control.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Confirmed influenza A and B infection using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and by measuring serum hemagglutination inhibition titers.


RESULTS
The mean rate of study vaccine coverage among eligible participants was 83% (range, 53%-100%) for the influenza vaccine colonies and 79% (range, 50%-100%) for the hepatitis A vaccine colonies. Among nonrecipients, 39 of 1271 (3.1%) in the influenza vaccine colonies and 80 of 1055 (7.6%) in the hepatitis A vaccine colonies had influenza illness confirmed by RT-PCR, for a protective effectiveness of 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-83%; P = .03). Among all study participants (those who were and those who were not vaccinated), 80 of 1773 (4.5%) in the influenza vaccine colonies and 159 of 1500 (10.6%) in the hepatitis A vaccine colonies had influenza illness confirmed by RT-PCR for an overall protective effectiveness of 59% (95% CI, 5%-82%; P = .04). No serious vaccine adverse events were observed.


CONCLUSION
Immunizing children and adolescents with inactivated influenza vaccine significantly protected unimmunized residents of rural communities against influenza.

covid-19,"COVID-19 had caused the epidemic in Wuhan of China in December 2019. The asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 was found with the further research. This paper summarizes the discovery of the asymptomatic infection cases, analyzes their outcomes and transmission risks, and put forward the targeted suggestions for the prevention and control of asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 according to the existing problems in epidemic response."
covid-19,"Epidemiologic Characteristics of the COVID-19 Outbreak Among a total of 72 314 case records (Box), 44 672 were classified as confirmed cases of COVID-19 (62%; diagnosis based on positive viral nucleic acid test result on throat swab samples), 16 186 as suspected cases (22%; diagnosis based on symptoms and exposures only, no test was performed because testing capacity is insufficient to meet current needs), 10 567 as clinically diagnosed cases (15%; this designation is being used in Hubei Province only; in these cases, no test was performed but diagnosis was made based on symptoms, exposures, and presence of lung imaging features consistent with coronavirus pneumonia), and 889 as asymptomatic cases (1%; diagnosis by positive viral nucleic acid test result but lacking typical symptoms including fever, dry cough, and fatigue).1 Most case patients were 30 to 79 years of age (87%), 1% were aged 9 years or younger, 1% were aged 10 to 19 years, and 3% were age 80 years or older. Most cases were diagnosed in Hubei Province (75%) and most reported Wuhan-related exposures (86%; ie, Wuhan resident or visitor or close contact with Wuhan resident or visitor). Most cases were classified as mild (81%; ie, nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia). However, 14% were severe (ie, dyspnea, respiratory frequency 30/min, blood oxygen saturation 93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours), and 5% were critical (ie, respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure) (Box).1 The overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% (1023 deaths among 44 672 confirmed cases). No deaths occurred in the group aged 9 years and younger, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8.0% CFR and cases in those aged 80 years and older had a 14.8% CFR. No deaths were reported among mild and severe cases. The CFR was 49.0% among critical cases. CFR was elevated among those with preexisting comorbid conditions—10.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer. Among the 44 672 cases, a total of 1716 were health workers (3.8%), 1080 of whom were in Wuhan (63%). Overall, 14.8% of confirmed cases among health workers were classified as severe or critical and 5 deaths were observed.1 COVID-19 rapidly spread from a single city to the entire country in just 30 days. The sheer speed of both the geographical expansion and the sudden increase in numbers of cases surprised and quickly overwhelmed health and public health services in China, particularly in Wuhan City and Hubei Province. Epidemic curves reflect what may be a mixed outbreak pattern, with early cases suggestive of a continuous common source, potentially zoonotic spillover at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and later cases suggestive of a propagated source as the virus began to be transmitted from person to person (Figure 1).1"
covid-19,"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic."
covid-19,"Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

covid-19,"Importance
There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).


Objective
To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a US health care system.


Design, Setting, and Participants
Case series of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, New York, within the Northwell Health system. The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates.


Exposures
Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected.


Results
A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%). At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/minute, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died. Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).


Conclusions and Relevance
This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area."
covid-19,"Abstract There are no standardized methods for collecting and reporting coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) data. We aimed to compare the proportion of patients admitted for COVID-19-related symptoms and those admitted for other reasons who incidentally tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Retrospective cohort study Data were sampled twice weekly between March 26 and June 6, 2020 from a “COVID-19 dashboard,” a system-wide administrative database that includes the number of hospitalized patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Patient charts were subsequently reviewed and the principal reason for hospitalization abstracted. Data collected during a statewide lockdown revealed that 92 hospitalized patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Among these individuals, 4.3% were hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19-related symptoms but were incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive. After the lockdown was suspended, the total inpatient census of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients increased to 128, 20.3% of whom were hospitalized for non-COVID-19-related complaints. In the absence of a statewide lockdown, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients admitted for non-COVID-19-related complaints who were incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive. In order to ensure data integrity, coding should distinguish between patients with COVID-19-related symptoms and asymptomatic patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
covid-19,"Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

covid-19,"COVID-19, the abbreviation for coronavirus disease 2019, is the name of the disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2, an abbreviation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The first report of this virus was in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 and now (Spring 2020) it has spread all over the world, so it is called a pandemic. This viral infection may cause fever, cough, tiredness, shortness of breath, and, in some cases, diarrhea. The infection usually causes mild symptoms in children and teenagers, but it can be lethal to the elderly. This virus can be spread between people very easily, so it is important to understand how to prevent its spread. The most effective ways to do this are by regularly washing hands with soap and water, maintaining a safe distance from other people, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoiding touching the face, eating a healthy diet, and staying home."
covid-19,"Abstract Background Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious. Methods We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only. Results A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P<0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%). Conclusions Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

covid-19,"BACKGROUND
Progressive respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19.


METHODS
We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro-computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression.


RESULTS
In patients who died from Covid-19-associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth - predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis - was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
In our small series, vascular angiogenesis distinguished the pulmonary pathobiology of Covid-19 from that of equally severe influenza virus infection. The universality and clinical implications of our observations require further research to define. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)."
covid-19,"Abstract Background No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. Methods We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. Results A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. Conclusions In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

covid-19,"Background Chest CT is used for diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as an important complement to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.

covid-19,"Glucocorticoids have been widely used in various infectious diseases, due to their important anti-inflammatory effect, but there lack powerful data supporting this treatment with potential side effects. Notwithstanding, dexamethasone proved to be beneficial on secondary end-points such as: shorter duration of hospitalisation (2 days vs. 13 days) and a greater chance of home discharge alive in the first 28 days (rate ratio: 1.10;95% CI, 1.03 to 1.17), successful weaning of invasive ventilation (rate ratio: 1.47;95% CI, 1.20 to 1.78), lower probability of renal-replacement treatment (risk ratio: 0.61;95% CI, 0.48 to 0.76). The RECOVERY trial offers evidences that sustain the usage of dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for up to 10 days to reduce the 28-day mortality in COVID-19 subjects requiring respiratory support, with or without ventilatory support."
covid-19,"Buscando elucidar as motivações que sustentam essa narrativa, o presente artigo teórico objetivou debater alguns dos argumentos utilizados para defendê-la, de modo a problematizar suas matrizes e apontar algumas de suas limitações. Para tal, foi realizada uma análise teórica do Projeto de Lei 5595/2020 e de publicações do Movimento Escolas Abertas na rede social Instagram que endossam a premissa da educação como serviço essencial. Evidenciou-se que as ideias que sustentam esse discurso são de cunho liberal e concebem a educação como elemento descolado da conjuntura histórico-social do período pandêmico. Abstract In the context of the suspension of face-to-face classes due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was highlighted the narrative that education should become an essential service, in order to ensure that face-to-face classes are mandatory, regardless of the incidence of calamitous events. Seeking to elucidate the motivations that support this narrative, this theoretical article aimed to discuss some of the arguments used to defend it, in order to problematize its matrixes and point out some of its limitations. To this end, a theoretical analysis was carried out of Brazilian Bill 5595/2020 and publications of the Open Schools Movement on the social network Instagram that endorse the premise of education as an essential service. It was evident that the ideas that support this discourse are of a liberal nature and conceive education as an element detached from the historical-social conjuncture of the pandemic period."

covid-19,"Only 3 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were identified in Italy in the first half of February 2020 and all involved people who had recently traveled to China. On February 20, 2020, a severe case of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was diagnosed in northern Italy’s Lombardy region in a man in his 30s who had no history of possible exposure abroad. Within 14 days, many other cases of COVID-19 in the surrounding area were diagnosed, including a substantial number of critically ill patients.1 On the basis of the number of cases and of the advanced stage of the disease it was hypothesized that the virus had been circulating within the population since January. Another cluster of patients with COVID-19 was simultaneously identified in Veneto, which borders Lombardy. Since then, the number of cases identified in Italy has rapidly increased, mainly in northern Italy, but all regions of the country have reported having patients with COVID-19. After China, Italy now has the second largest number of COVID-19 cases2 and also has a very high case-fatality rate.3 This Viewpoint reviews the Italian experience with COVID-19 with an emphasis on fatalities."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019. However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited.


Objective
To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed.


Results
A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]). A total of 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years; P < .001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8%] vs 78 of 334 [23.4%]; P < .001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13 800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/μL) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] μg/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs <0.006 [<0.006-0.009] μg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6%] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5%]). Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P < .001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P < .001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%]; P < .001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%]; P < .001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%]; P = .003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%]; P = .01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%]; P = .02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P < .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]).

covid-19,"Abstract Background In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China. Methods Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients. Results Of the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection. The median age was 58 years and 235 were male. The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia. Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases. Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group. The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases. Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases. Conclusions The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19."

covid-19,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage. Corticosteroids may modulate immune-mediated lung injury and reducing progression to respiratory failure and death. Methods: The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is a randomized, controlled, open-label, adaptive, platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We report the preliminary results for the comparison of dexamethasone 6 mg given once daily for up to ten days vs. usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Results: 2104 patients randomly allocated to receive dexamethasone were compared with 4321 patients concurrently allocated to usual care. Overall, 454 (21.6%) patients allocated dexamethasone and 1065 (24.6%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio [RR] 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74 to 0.92; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute mortality rate reductions varied significantly depending on level of respiratory support at randomization (test for trend p<0.001): Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.0% vs. 40.7%, RR 0.65 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.82]; p<0.001), by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (21.5% vs. 25.0%, RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.70 to 0.92]; p=0.002), but did not reduce mortality in patients not receiving respiratory support at randomization (17.0% vs. 13.2%, RR 1.22 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.61]; p=0.14). Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality among those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen at randomization, but not among patients not receiving respiratory support."

SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies.


Conclusions and Relevance
As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions."
covid-19,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020. The implementation of unprecedented strict quarantine measures in China has kept a large number of people in isolation and affected many aspects of people’s lives. It has also triggered a wide variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. This study is the first nationwide large-scale survey of psychological distress in the general population of China during the COVID-19 epidemic."
covid-19,"Educational institutions (schools, colleges, and universities) in India are currently based only on traditional methods of learning, that is, they follow the traditional set up of face-to-face lectures in a classroom. Although many academic units have also started blended learning, still a lot of them are stuck with old procedures. The sudden outbreak of a deadly disease called Covid-19 caused by a Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) shook the entire world. The World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. This situation challenged the education system across the world and forced educators to shift to an online mode of teaching overnight. Many academic institutions that were earlier reluctant to change their traditional pedagogical approach had no option but to shift entirely to online teaching–learning. The article includes the importance of online learning and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, & Challenges (SWOC) analysis of e-learning modes in the time of crisis. This article also put some light on the growth of EdTech Start-ups during the time of pandemic and natural disasters and includes suggestions for academic institutions of how to deal with challenges associated with online learning."

covid-19,"Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is challenging the world. With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the main strategy to contain the pandemic. Unprecedented global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders are causing the most severe disruption of the global economy since World War II. With international travel bans affecting over 90% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020. Early evidence on impacts on air travel, cruises, and accommodations have been devastating. While highly uncertain, early projections from UNWTO for 2020 suggest international arrivals could decline by 20 to 30% relative to 2019. Tourism is especially susceptible to measures to counteract pandemics because of restricted mobility and social distancing. The paper compares the impacts of COVID-19 to previous epidemic/pandemics and other types of global crises and explores how the pandemic may change society, the economy, and tourism. It discusses why COVID-19 is an analogue to the ongoing climate crisis, and why there is a need to question the volume growth tourism model advocated by UNWTO, ICAO, CLIA, WTTC and other tourism organizations."
covid-19,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide. Objective To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status. Methods We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results The mean age was 48.9 years and 686 (42.7%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95% CI) 2.681 (1.424–5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03–2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07–2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60–7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points. The hazard ratio (95% CI) was 1.79 (1.16–2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (1.61–4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. Conclusion Among laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. The presence and number of comorbidities predict clinical outcomes of COVID-19 http://bit.ly/3b9ibw5"
covid-19,"Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status."
covid-19,"This study examined the epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 using a retrospective analytical approach. OBJECTIVE: To identify the epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of pediatric patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. METHODS: Nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16, 2020, to February 8, 2020, were included. The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis. Onset-to-diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates. RESULTS: There were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) suspected cases. The median age of all patients was 7 years (interquartile range: 2–13 years), and 1208 case patients (56.6%) were boys. More than 90% of all patients had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases. The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days (range: 0–42 days). There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic, and then there was a gradual and steady decrease. The disease rapidly spread from Hubei province to surrounding provinces over time. More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province. CONCLUSIONS: Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant sex difference. Although clinical manifestations of children’s COVID-19 cases were generally less severe than those of adult patients, young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection. The distribution of children’s COVID-19 cases varied with time and space, and most of the cases were concentrated in Hubei province and surrounding areas. Furthermore, this study provides strong evidence of human-to-human transmission."
covid-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future."
covid-19,"Abstract Background Community transmission of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) was detected in the state of Washington in February 2020. Methods We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up. Results We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Conclusions During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both. Mortality among these critically ill patients was high. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)"
covid-19,"Significance In patients with coronavirus disease 2019, a large number of T lymphocytes and mononuclear macrophages are activated, producing cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), which bind to the IL-6 receptor on the target cells, causing the cytokine storm and severe inflammatory responses in lungs and other tissues and organs. Tocilizumab, as a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, can bind to the IL-6 receptor with high affinity, thus preventing IL-6 itself from binding to its receptor, rendering it incapable of immune damage to target cells, and alleviating the inflammatory responses. After analyzing the immune characteristics of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes with large amount of interleukin 6 secreting may incite the inflammatory storm, which may potentially be curbed through monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways. Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People’s Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between 5 and 14 February 2020. The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Fever returned to normal on the first day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days. Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy. CT scans manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 19 patients (90.5%). The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 ± 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased significantly in 84.2% of patients (16/19). No obvious adverse reactions were observed. All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab. Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality."
covid-19,"Importance
The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection.


Observations
No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19.


Conclusions and Relevance
The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date."
covid-19,"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Background: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. Methods: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. Results: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new evidence in further releases of these guidelines."
covid-19,"from for The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated policy responses to it were highly disruptive of supply chains throughout the economy in 2020 – disruptive on an unprecedented scale. Massive shocks on both the de-mand and supply sides of the market presented par-ticular challenges in agricultural product markets. These were arguably most pronounced in the protein sector. This paper will examine these protein sector supply chain shocks, exploring the nature and causes of the market disruptions during the height of the pandemic, evaluating the effects of these shocks from an economic perspective, and identifying potential market and policy responses that could mitigate the adverse effects of similar events in the future. feedstuffs or by calculating programmed rates of gain using the net en-ergy system. Instead, many producers chose to attempt maximal rates of gain hoping persistent growth and feeding margins would offset discounts due to heavy carcass weights and excess fatness when the supply chain began moving again. Regarding new placements, the structure of the beef industry is uniquely devel-oped to absorb cattle in stocker and backgrounding operations. This presentation will review the factors impacting cattle production and provide case-studies related to feeding at maintenance and growth rates, ef-ficiencies, and carcass outcomes of held cattle from an operation and industry level."
covid-19,"Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic."
covid-19,"Huge citizens expose to social media during a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China. We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged≥18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80% (95%CI:80.9%-83.1%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.31–2.26) and CDA (OR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.52–2.41) compared with less SME. Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health problems, especially depression and anxiety among general population and combating with “infodemic” while combating during public health emergency."
covid-19,"Interferons interfere with lung repair Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity. Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions. Type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections. By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-λ) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses. Accordingly, IFN-λ has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna). Broggi et al. report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung. Furthermore, IFN-λ secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al. found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-λ) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation. Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al. observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-α–fueled responses. This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial. The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory infections. Science, this issue p. 706, p. 712, p. 718; see also p. 626 Interferons can both enhance and abate the severity of respiratory viral infections. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression that suggest diverse host immune responses. We performed an integrated immune analysis on a cohort of 50 COVID-19 patients with various disease severity. A distinct phenotype was observed in severe and critical patients, consisting of a highly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response (characterized by no IFN-β and low IFN-α production and activity), which was associated with a persistent blood viral load and an exacerbated inflammatory response. Inflammation was partially driven by the transcriptional factor nuclear factor–κB and characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor–α and interleukin-6 production and signaling. These data suggest that type I IFN deficiency in the blood could be a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and provide a rationale for combined therapeutic approaches."
covid-19,"The 2023 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report includes relevant topics from the clinician’s perspective and evidence published on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) since GOLD 2017. The World Health Organization (WHO) and GOLD 2023 have developed an updated definition of COPD as, “a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airway (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.” GOLD 2023 includes recommendations for COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and acknowledges the role of reduced air quality in the etiology and progression of COPD. In May 2023, the GOLD Scientific Committee on Air Pollution and COPD reported that air pollution increasingly contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD. This Editorial aims to introduce the updated GOLD 2023 report in the context of climate change and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic."
covid-19,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019 Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019 As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as ""pneumonia of unknown etiology "" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19 On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a ""COVID-19,"" which is the acronym of ""coronavirus disease 2019"" In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred  SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases This new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs) The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species  For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS  Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the ""very high"" level, on February 28, 2020 Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interac ion and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a progressive reduction of cases in the last few days In Italy, in geographic regions of the north of the peninsula, political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock wave that is severely testing the health system In the midst of the crisis, the authors have chosen to use the ""Statpearls"" platform because, within the PubMed scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in real-time  The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated"
covid-19,"Abstract Objective To characterise the clinical features of patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United Kingdom during the growth phase of the first wave of this outbreak who were enrolled in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study, and to explore risk factors associated with mortality in hospital. Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. Setting 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission. Participants 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19. Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital. Results The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16%, 2830/17 506); 23% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37% (618/1658) died, and 46% (764/1658) remained in hospital. Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital. Conclusions ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19. The study continues to enrol at the time of this report. In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity. This study has shown the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks. Study registration ISRCTN66726260."

covid-19,"Abstract In this retrospective study, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from four centers in China from January 18, 2020 to February 2, 2020 were reviewed for common CT findings in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan (i.e. early, 0-2 days (36 patients), intermediate 3-5 days (33 patients), late 6-12 days (25 patients)). The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging were bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities. Notably, 20/36 (56%) of early patients had a normal CT. With a longer time after the onset of symptoms, CT findings were more frequent, including consolidation, bilateral and peripheral disease, greater total lung involvement, linear opacities, “crazy-paving” pattern and the “reverse halo” sign. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10/36 early patients (28%), 25/33 intermediate patients (76%), and 22/25 late patients (88%)."
covid-19,"Tracing infection from mobility data What sort of measures are required to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? The rich data from the Open COVID-19 Data Working Group include the dates when people first reported symptoms, not just a positive test date. Using these data and real-time travel data from the internet services company Baidu, Kraemer et al. found that mobility statistics offered a precise record of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among the cities of China at the start of 2020. The frequency of introductions from Wuhan were predictive of the size of the epidemic sparked in other provinces. However, once the virus had escaped Wuhan, strict local control measures such as social isolation and hygiene, rather than long-distance travel restrictions, played the largest part in controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread. Science, this issue p. 493 Mobile phone data show that the spread of COVID-19 in China was driven by travel and mitigated substantially by local control measures. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions were undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19."
covid-19,"The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; previously 2019-nCoV), epi-centered in Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China, has spread to many other countries. On January 30, 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee declared a global health emergency based on growing case notification rates at Chinese and international locations. The case detection rate is changing hourly and daily and can be tracked in almost real time on website provided by Johns Hopkins University [1] and other websites. As of early February 2020, China bears the large burden of morbidity and mortality, whereas the incidence in other Asian countries, in Europe and North America remains low so far."
covid-19,"Abstract Background World Health Organization expert groups recommended mortality trials of four repurposed antiviral drugs — remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a — in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Methods We randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry. Results At 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan–Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P=0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P=0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P=0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration. Conclusions These remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

covid-19,"Abstract Background Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Methods We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day. Results Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation. Conclusions In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy. (Funded by Gilead Sciences.)"
covid-19,"Background: The current outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus infection among humans in Wuhan (China) and its spreading around the globe is heavily impacting on the global health and mental health. Despite all resources employed to counteract the spreading of the virus, additional global strategies are needed to handle the related mental health issues. Methods: Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed. Comments: This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. Collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention strategies and decision-making from policy makers, health organizations and medical centers, which can weaken strategies of COVID-19 control and lead to more morbidity and mental health needs at global level."

covid-19,"Abstract Background The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom. The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. Methods We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients’ vaccination status. Results Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant. Conclusions Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded by Public Health England.)"
covid-19,"On 5 February 2020, in Yokohama, Japan, a cruise ship hosting 3,711 people underwent a 2-week quarantine after a former passenger was found with COVID-19 post-disembarking. As at 20 February, 634 persons on board tested positive for the causative virus. We conducted statistical modelling to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of infections, along with the infections’ timeline. The estimated asymptomatic proportion was 17.9% (95% credible interval (CrI): 15.5–20.2%). Most infections occurred before the quarantine start."
covid-19,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the counts of T cells and serum cytokine concentration from data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers were measured in 14 COVID-19 cases. Results: The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells lower than 800, 300, or 400/μL, respectively, were negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers were negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α concentration, with patients in the disease resolution period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1. Increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages. Conclusions: T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients with total T cells counts lower than 800/μL may still require urgent intervention, even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition."
covid-19,"Importance
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality. It is critical to find new treatments.


Objective
To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.


Design, Setting, and Participants
Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.


Exposures
Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.


Results
All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.


Conclusions and Relevance
In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials."

covid-19,"Abstract Background A rapid increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases due to the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in highly vaccinated populations has aroused concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines. Methods We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron and delta (B.1.617.2) variants in England. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated after primary immunization with two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and after a booster dose of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or mRNA-1273. Results Between November 27, 2021, and January 12, 2022, a total of 886,774 eligible persons infected with the omicron variant, 204,154 eligible persons infected with the delta variant, and 1,572,621 eligible test-negative controls were identified. At all time points investigated and for all combinations of primary course and booster vaccines, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was higher for the delta variant than for the omicron variant. No effect against the omicron variant was noted from 20 weeks after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 doses, whereas vaccine effectiveness after two BNT162b2 doses was 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.9 to 67.0) at 2 to 4 weeks, dropping to 8.8% (95% CI, 7.0 to 10.5) at 25 or more weeks. Among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 62.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 63.0) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before decreasing to 39.6% (95% CI, 38.0 to 41.1) at 10 or more weeks. Among BNT162b2 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 67.2% (95% CI, 66.5 to 67.8) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before declining to 45.7% (95% CI, 44.7 to 46.7) at 10 or more weeks. Vaccine effectiveness after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course increased to 70.1% (95% CI, 69.5 to 70.7) at 2 to 4 weeks after an mRNA-1273 booster and decreased to 60.9% (95% CI, 59.7 to 62.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. After a BNT162b2 primary course, the mRNA-1273 booster increased vaccine effectiveness to 73.9% (95% CI, 73.1 to 74.6) at 2 to 4 weeks; vaccine effectiveness fell to 64.4% (95% CI, 62.6 to 66.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. Conclusions Primary immunization with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. A BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster after either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 primary course substantially increased protection, but that protection waned over time.

covid-19,"Abstract Background Nirmatrelvir is an orally administered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor with potent pan–human-coronavirus activity in vitro. Methods We conducted a phase 2–3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which symptomatic, unvaccinated, nonhospitalized adults at high risk for progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg of nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir (a pharmacokinetic enhancer) or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days. Covid-19–related hospitalization or death from any cause through day 28, viral load, and safety were evaluated. Results A total of 2246 patients underwent randomization; 1120 patients received nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (nirmatrelvir group) and 1126 received placebo (placebo group). In the planned interim analysis of patients treated within 3 days after symptom onset (modified intention-to treat population, comprising 774 of the 1361 patients in the full analysis population), the incidence of Covid-19–related hospitalization or death by day 28 was lower in the nirmatrelvir group than in the placebo group by 6.32 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], −9.04 to −3.59; P<0.001; relative risk reduction, 89.1%); the incidence was 0.77% (3 of 389 patients) in the nirmatrelvir group, with 0 deaths, as compared with 7.01% (27 of 385 patients) in the placebo group, with 7 deaths. Efficacy was maintained in the final analysis involving the 1379 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population, with a difference of −5.81 percentage points (95% CI, −7.78 to −3.84; P<0.001; relative risk reduction, 88.9%). All 13 deaths occurred in the placebo group. The viral load was lower with nirmaltrelvir plus ritonavir than with placebo at day 5 of treatment, with an adjusted mean difference of −0.868 log10 copies per milliliter when treatment was initiated within 3 days after the onset of symptoms. The incidence of adverse events that emerged during the treatment period was similar in the two groups (any adverse event, 22.6% with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir vs. 23.9% with placebo; serious adverse events, 1.6% vs. 6.6%; and adverse events leading to discontinuation of the drugs or placebo, 2.1% vs. 4.2%). Dysgeusia (5.6% vs. 0.3%) and diarrhea (3.1% vs. 1.6%) occurred more frequently with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir than with placebo. Conclusions Treatment of symptomatic Covid-19 with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir resulted in a risk of progression to severe Covid-19 that was 89% lower than the risk with placebo, without evident safety concerns.

covid-19,"The genetics underlying severe COVID-19 The immune system is complex and involves many genes, including those that encode cytokines known as interferons (IFNs). Individuals that lack specific IFNs can be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Furthermore, the autoantibody system dampens IFN response to prevent damage from pathogen-induced inflammation. Two studies now examine the likelihood that genetics affects the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through components of this system (see the Perspective by Beck and Aksentijevich). Q. Zhang et al. used a candidate gene approach and identified patients with severe COVID-19 who have mutations in genes involved in the regulation of type I and III IFN immunity. They found enrichment of these genes in patients and conclude that genetics may determine the clinical course of the infection. Bastard et al. identified individuals with high titers of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN-α2 and IFN-ω in about 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These autoantibodies were not found either in infected people who were asymptomatic or had milder phenotype or in healthy individuals. Together, these studies identify a means by which individuals at highest risk of life-threatening COVID-19 can be identified. Science, this issue p. eabd4570, p. eabd4585; see also p. 404 In a large immunological and genomics study of COVID-19 patients, autoantibodies to type 1 interferons correlated with outcomes. INTRODUCTION Interindividual clinical variability is vast in humans infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ranging from silent infection to rapid death. Three risk factors for life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia have been identified—being male, being elderly, or having other medical conditions—but these risk factors cannot explain why critical disease remains relatively rare in any given epidemiological group. Given the rising toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality, understanding the causes and mechanisms of life-threatening COVID-19 is crucial. RATIONALE B cell autoimmune infectious phenocopies of three inborn errors of cytokine immunity exist, in which neutralizing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (mycobacterial disease), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (staphylococcal disease), and IL-17A and IL-17F (mucocutaneous candidiasis) mimic the clinical phenotypes of germline mutations of the genes that encode the corresponding cytokines or receptors. Human inborn errors of type I IFNs underlie severe viral respiratory diseases. Neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs, which have been found in patients with a few underlying noninfectious conditions, have not been unequivocally shown to underlie severe viral infections. While searching for inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, we also tested the hypothesis that neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs may underlie critical COVID-19. We searched for auto-Abs against type I IFNs in 987 patients hospitalized for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, 663 asymptomatic or mildly affected individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 1227 healthy controls from whom samples were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS At least 101 of 987 patients (10.2%) with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) auto-Abs against IFN-ω (13 patients), against the 13 types of IFN-α (36), or against both (52) at the onset of critical disease; a few also had auto-Abs against the other three individual type I IFNs. These auto-Abs neutralize high concentrations of the corresponding type I IFNs, including their ability to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Moreover, all of the patients tested had low or undetectable serum IFN-α levels during acute disease. These auto-Abs were present before infection in the patients tested and were absent from 663 individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (P < 10−16). They were present in only 4 of 1227 (0.33%) healthy individuals (P < 10−16) before the pandemic. The patients with auto-Abs were 25 to 87 years old (half were over 65) and of various ancestries. Notably, 95 of the 101 patients with auto-Abs were men (94%). CONCLUSION A B cell autoimmune phenocopy of inborn errors of type I IFN immunity accounts for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men. In these patients, adaptive autoimmunity impairs innate and intrinsic antiviral immunity. These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening COVID-19 and the increase in risk with age. They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening COVID-19 and ensuring their enrolment in vaccine trials. Finally, they pave the way for prevention and treatment, including plasmapheresis, plasmablast depletion, and recombinant type I IFNs not targeted by the auto-Abs (e.g., IFN-β). Neutralizing auto-Abs to type I IFNs underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. We tested the hypothesis that neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs may underlie critical COVID-19 by impairing the binding of type I IFNs to their receptor and the activation of the downstream responsive pathway. Neutralizing auto-Abs are represented in red, and type I IFNs are represented in blue. In these patients, adaptive autoimmunity impairs innate and intrinsic antiviral immunity.

Interindividual clinical variability in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is vast. We report that at least 101 of 987 patients with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia had neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against interferon-ω (IFN-ω) (13 patients), against the 13 types of IFN-α (36), or against both (52) at the onset of critical disease; a few also had auto-Abs against the other three type I IFNs. The auto-Abs neutralize the ability of the corresponding type I IFNs to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. These auto-Abs were not found in 663 individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and were present in only 4 of 1227 healthy individuals. Patients with auto-Abs were aged 25 to 87 years and 95 of the 101 were men.

covid-19,"Abstract Background As mass vaccination campaigns against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) commence worldwide, vaccine effectiveness needs to be assessed for a range of outcomes across diverse populations in a noncontrolled setting. In this study, data from Israel’s largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Methods All persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics. Study outcomes included documented infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), symptomatic Covid-19, Covid-19–related hospitalization, severe illness, and death. We estimated vaccine effectiveness for each outcome as one minus the risk ratio, using the Kaplan–Meier estimator. Results Each study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 to 86) and 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 to 80) and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72% (95% CI, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose. Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions. Conclusions This study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19–related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial."
covid-19,"Outbreak to pandemic In response to global dispersion of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), quarantine measures have been implemented around the world. To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic. Science, this issue p. 395 A SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological model reveals the effects of travel restrictions and transmission reduction efforts on the spread of this novel virus. Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community."

 Abstract
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19–associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.

covid-19,"Abstract Objective To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia. Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. Data sources PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. Data extraction At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). Results 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

covid-19,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people. Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare.
covid-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with mental health challenges related to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and to mitigation activities, including the impact of physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.* Symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased considerably in the United States during April-June of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019 (1,2). To assess mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation during the pandemic, representative panel surveys were conducted among adults aged ≥18 years across the United States during June 24-30, 2020. Overall, 40.9% of respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition, including symptoms of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder (30.9%), symptoms of a trauma- and stressor-related disorder (TSRD) related to the pandemic† (26.3%), and having started or increased substance use to cope with stress or emotions related to COVID-19 (13.3%). The percentage of respondents who reported having seriously considered suicide in the 30 days before completing the survey (10.7%) was significantly higher among respondents aged 18-24 years (25.5%), minority racial/ethnic groups (Hispanic respondents [18.6%], non-Hispanic black [black] respondents [15.1%]), self-reported unpaid caregivers for adults§ (30.7%), and essential workers¶ (21.7%). Community-level intervention and prevention efforts, including health communication strategies, designed to reach these groups could help address various mental health conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic."
covid-19,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gripped the world with apprehension and has evoked a scare of epic proportion regarding its potential to spread and infect humans worldwide. As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host–virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the need for a model for staging COVID-19 based on neurological tissue involvement."
covid-19,"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS‐CoV‐2 (previously known as 2019‐nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS‐CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID‐19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID‐19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS‐CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse‐connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS‐CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID‐19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced respiratory failure."
covid-19,"Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important to decipher mechanisms of host responses and interpret disease pathogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections but might also contribute to immunopathology. Using 28-color flow cytometry, we here reveal strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients. This pattern was mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of NK cells in bronchoalveolar lavage from COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis of peripheral blood NK cells furthermore identified distinct NK cell immunotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting increased presence of adaptive NK cells in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed across COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors. This study provides a detailed map of the NK cell activation landscape in COVID-19 disease. The NK cell activation landscape in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with COVID-19 disease severity."
covid-19,"OBJECTIVE Patients with obesity are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections. However, the association of obesity with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. We examined this association using data from the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 383 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted from 11 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 and followed until 26 March 2020 at the Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen were included. Underweight was defined as a BMI <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight as 18.5–23.9 kg/m2, overweight as 24.0–27.9 kg/m2, and obesity as ≥28 kg/m2. RESULTS Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission. Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese. Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99–3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40–2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and cancer, and drug used for treatment. Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80–17.75, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment."
covid-19,"Abstract Aim To examine the relative influence of fear of COVID‐19 on nurses' psychological distress, work satisfaction and intent to leave their organisation and the profession. Background The emergence of COVID‐19 has significantly impacted the psychological and mental well‐being of frontline health care workers, including nurses. To date, no studies have been conducted examining how this fear of COVID‐19 contributes to health, well‐being and work outcomes in frontline nurses. Methods This is a cross‐sectional research design involving 261 frontline nurses in the Philippines. Five standardized scales were used for data collection. Results Overall, the composite score of the fear of COVID‐19 scale was 19.92. Job role and attendance of COVID‐19‐related training predicted fear of COVID‐19. An increased level of fear of COVID‐19 was associated with decreased job satisfaction, increased psychological distress and increased organisational and professional turnover intentions. Conclusions Frontline nurses who reported not having attended COVID‐19‐related training and those who held part‐time job roles reported increased fears of COVID‐19. Addressing the fear of COVID‐19 may result in improved job outcomes in frontline nurses, such as increased job satisfaction, decreased stress levels and lower intent to leave the organisation and the profession. Implications for Nursing Management Organisational measures are vital to support the mental health of nurses and address their fear of COVID‐19 through peer and social support, psychological and mental support services (e.g. counselling or psychotherapy), provision of training related to COVID‐19 and accurate and regular information updates."
covid-19,"THE ISSUE
Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives. Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many.


RECOMMENDATIONS
The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

covid-19,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic. Neurological complications of COVID-19 have not been reported. Encephalopathy has not been described as a presenting symptom or complication of COVID-19. We report a case of a 74-year-old patient who traveled from Europe to the United States and presented with encephalopathy and COVID-19.
covid-19,"The Covid-19 pandemic is now beginning to spread to the world of education. The Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) is currently based on official information, ready with all scenarios, including encouraging online learning for students. This article is a kind of position paper—it clearances one side of a debatable opinion about a hot issue. The aim of a position paper is to persuade the reader that our opinion is valid and defensible. In regards to our position as researchers, then, the point of view is separated into four parts: The philosophy of “Merdeka Belajar”, physical distancing, social distancing and self-quarantine, digital learning in Indonesia to face Covid-19, ‘Merdeka Belajar', digital learning, Covid-19, and authors' view."
covid-19,"A recent JAMA viewpoint regarding fatalities In Italy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic failed to mention obesity as one of the pre-existing diseases associated with death.1 It seems likely that the increased prevalence of obesity in Italy older adults compared to China may account for the differences in mortality between the two countries. Furthermore, the rising prevalence of obesity in the US and prior experience of the impact of obesity on mortality from H1 N1 Influenza should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for patients with obesity and COVID-19 to the need for aggressive treatment of such patients."
covid-19,"Emerging data indicate that complement and neutrophils are involved in the maladaptive host immune response that fuels hyper-inflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy increasing the mortality rate in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we investigated the interaction between complement and the platelet/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 clinical samples, cell-based inhibition studies and NETs/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) co-cultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, TF activity and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils yielded high tissue factor (TF) expression and released NETs carrying functionally active TF. Confirming our ex vivo findings, treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAEC. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. Serum isolated from COVID-19 patients induces complement activation in vitro, which is consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement inhibition at the level of C3 with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis that reveals the pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immmunothrombosis. This study supports emerging strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection that exploit complement therapeutics or NETosis inhibition."
covid-19,"As the COVID-19 virus quickly spreads around the world, unfortunately, misinformation related to COVID-19 also gets created and spreads like wild fire. Such misinformation has caused confusion among people, disruptions in society, and even deadly consequences in health problems. To be able to understand, detect, and mitigate such COVID-19 misinformation, therefore, has not only deep intellectual values but also huge societal impacts. To help researchers combat COVID-19 health misinformation, therefore, we present CoAID (Covid-19 heAlthcare mIsinformation Dataset), with diverse COVID-19 healthcare misinformation, including fake news on websites and social platforms, along with users' social engagement about such news. CoAID includes 4,251 news, 296,000 related user engagements, 926 social platform posts about COVID-19, and ground truth labels. The dataset is available at: this https URL."
covid-19,"Key Points Question Are population-level social factors associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence and mortality? Findings In this cross-sectional study including 4 289 283 COVID-19 cases and 147 074 COVID-19 deaths, county-level sociodemographic risk factors as assessed by the Social Vulnerability Index were associated with greater COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Meaning These findings suggest that to address inequities in the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, these sociodemographic risk factors and their root causes must be addressed."
covid-19,"Abstract Objective To review the evidence on the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis, Joanna Briggs, Global Health, and World Health Organization COVID-19 database (preprints). Eligibility criteria for study selection Observational and interventional studies that assessed the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality. Main outcome measures The main outcome measure was incidence of covid-19. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality. Data synthesis DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing measures on incidence of covid-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and the I2 metrics, with two tailed P values. Results 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a “package of interventions.” Eight of 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of covid-19 associated with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I2=12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I2=84%), and physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I2=87%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation, universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing are associated with reductions in the incidence covid-19. Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of covid-19 vaccination.

covid-19,"In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) vaccine,† and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for their use in persons aged ≥16 years and ≥18 years, respectively.§ In May 2021, FDA expanded the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents aged 12-15 years; ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥12 years receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Both mRNA vaccines were authorized and recommended as a 2-dose schedule, with second doses administered 21 days (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 28 days (Moderna) after the first dose. After reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in mRNA vaccine recipients,¶ which predominantly occurred in young males after the second dose, an ACIP meeting was rapidly convened to review reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis and discuss the benefits and risks of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle; if it is accompanied by pericarditis, an inflammation of the thin tissue surrounding the heart (the pericardium), it is referred to as myopericarditis. Hereafter, myocarditis is used to refer to myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis. On June 23, 2021, after reviewing available evidence including that for risks of myocarditis, ACIP determined that the benefits of using mRNA COVID-19 vaccines under the FDA's EUA clearly outweigh the risks in all populations, including adolescents and young adults. The EUA has been modified to include information on myocarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The EUA fact sheets should be provided before vaccination; in addition, CDC has developed patient and provider education materials about the possibility of myocarditis and symptoms of concern, to ensure prompt recognition and management of myocarditis."
covid-19,"Importance
Myocarditis has been reported with COVID-19 but is not clearly recognized as a possible adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination.


Objective
To describe myocarditis presenting after COVID-19 vaccination within the Military Health System.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This retrospective case series studied patients within the US Military Health System who experienced myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination between January and April 2021. Patients who sought care for chest pain following COVID-19 vaccination and were subsequently diagnosed with clinical myocarditis were included.


Exposure
Receipt of a messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine between January 1 and April 30, 2021.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Clinical diagnosis of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in the absence of other identified causes.


Results
A total of 23 male patients (22 currently serving in the military and 1 retiree; median [range] age, 25 [20-51] years) presented with acute onset of marked chest pain within 4 days after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. All military members were previously healthy with a high level of fitness. Seven received the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine and 16 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. A total of 20 patients had symptom onset following the second dose of an appropriately spaced 2-dose series. All patients had significantly elevated cardiac troponin levels. Among 8 patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging within the acute phase of illness, all had findings consistent with the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. Additional testing did not identify other etiologies for myocarditis, including acute COVID-19 and other infections, ischemic injury, or underlying autoimmune conditions. All patients received brief supportive care and were recovered or recovering at the time of this report. The military administered more than 2.8 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in this period. While the observed number of myocarditis cases was small, the number was higher than expected among male military members after a second vaccine dose.


Conclusions and Relevance
In this case series, myocarditis occurred in previously healthy military patients with similar clinical presentations following receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Further surveillance and evaluation of this adverse event following immunization is warranted. Potential for rare vaccine-related adverse events must be considered in the context of the well-established risk of morbidity, including cardiac injury, following COVID-19 infection."
covid-19,"Importance
A comprehensive understanding of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination requires consideration of disease attenuation, determined as whether people who develop COVID-19 despite vaccination have lower disease severity than unvaccinated people.


Objective
To evaluate the association between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines-mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)-and COVID-19 hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the association with progression to critical disease.


Design, Setting, and Participants
A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513 adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome data on death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through July 14, 2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021.


Exposures
COVID-19 vaccination.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Associations were evaluated between prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients were those hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients with and without progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were measured with multivariable logistic regression.


Results
Among 4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8%] women; 23.0% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9% Hispanic individuals, and 20.1% with an immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2% (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases, 15.8%; controls, 54.8%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7% vs 51.7%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta variants (21.9% vs 61.8%; aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2% vs 53.5%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09-0.13) than immunocompromised patients (40.1% vs 58.8%; aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69) (P < .001) and weaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with BNT162b2 (5.8% vs 11.5%; aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27-0.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9% vs 8.3%; aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P < .001). Among 1197 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0% vs 24.7%; aOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58).


Conclusions and Relevance
Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19 hospitalization and disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation. These findings are consistent with risk reduction among vaccine breakthrough infections compared with absence of vaccination."
covid-19,"Background: Acceptance of any COVID-19 vaccine is an important challenge to address and will play a major role in combating the pandemic. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are amongst the first group to receive the vaccination, so it is important to consider their attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the attitude of HCWs toward the COVID-19 vaccination. Data was collected between October 7th and November 9th, 2020. We received 4080 responses out of which 3479 were complete responses and were included in the final analysis. Results: 36% of respondents were willing to take the vaccine as soon as it became available while 56% were not sure or would wait to review more data. Vaccine acceptance increased with increasing age, education, and income level. Lower acceptance was noted in females (31%), Black (10%), Hispanic (30%) and conservative/republican (21%) HCWs, and those working in a rural setting (26%). In the multinomial regression model, direct medical care providers and those with heart disease and cancer had a lower likelihood of waiting to review than accepting vaccines. Safety (69%), effectiveness (69%) and rapidity of development/approval (74%) were noted as the most common concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine in our survey. Conclusion: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is low, with the majority of healthcare workers choosing to wait to review more data before deciding. Overall attitude toward vaccination was positive but specific concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine are prevalent. Differences in vaccine acceptance were noted along lines of social determinants of health which should be addressed to avoid magnifying health disparities."
covid-19,"Key Points Question What are the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection? Findings In this systematic review of 45 studies including 9751 participants with COVID-19, the median proportion of individuals who experienced at least 1 persistent symptom was 73%; symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea, fatigue or exhaustion, and sleep disorders or insomnia. However, the studies were highly heterogeneous and needed longer follow-up and more standardized designs. Meaning This systematic review found that COVID-19 symptoms commonly persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life; however, methodological improvements are needed to reliably quantify these risks."
covid-19,"Key Points Question Are race and ethnicity–based COVID-19 outcome disparities in the United States associated with socioeconomic characteristics? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 4.3 million patients from 68 studies, African American, Hispanic, and Asian American individuals had a higher risk of COVID-19 positivity and ICU admission but lower mortality rates than White individuals. Socioeconomic disparity and clinical care quality were associated with COVID-19 mortality and incidence in racial and ethnic minority groups. Meaning In this study, members of racial and ethnic minority groups had higher rates of COVID-19 positivity and disease severity than White populations; these findings are important for informing public health decisions, particularly for individuals living in socioeconomically deprived communities."
covid-19,"Abstract In late December 2019 an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing severe pneumonia (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. A common finding in most COVID-19 patients is high D-dimer levels which are associated with a worse prognosis. We aimed to evaluate coagulation abnormalities via traditional tests and whole blood thromboelastometry profiles in a group of 22 (mean age 67 ± 8 years, M:F 20:2) consecutive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Padova University Hospital for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Cases showed significantly higher fibrinogen and D-dimer plasma levels versus healthy controls (p < 0.0001 in both comparisons). Interestingly enough, markedly hypercoagulable thromboelastometry profiles were observed in COVID-19 patients, as reflected by shorter Clot Formation Time (CFT) in INTEM (p = 0.0002) and EXTEM (p = 0.01) and higher Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) in INTEM, EXTEM and FIBTEM (p < 0.001 in all comparisons). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy. Fibrin formation and polymerization may predispose to thrombosis and correlate with a worse outcome."
covid-19,"Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. To construct a comprehensive picture of the mental health status in COVID‐19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and random‐effects meta‐analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in this population. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Wanfang Data, Wangfang Med Online, CNKI, and CQVIP for relevant articles, and we included 31 studies (n = 5153) in our analyses. We found that the pooled prevalence of depression was 45% (95% CI: 37–54%, I2 = 96%), the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 47% (95% CI: 37–57%, I2 = 97%), and the pooled prevalence of sleeping disturbances was 34% (95% CI: 19–50%, I2 = 98%). We did not find any significant differences in the prevalence estimates between different genders; however, the depression and anxiety prevalence estimates varied based on different screening tools. More observational studies assessing the mental wellness of COVID‐19 outpatients and COVID‐19 patients from countries other than China are needed to further examine the psychological implications of COVID‐19 infections."
covid-19,"The COVID-19 outbreak has led to 80,409 diagnosed cases and 3,012 deaths in mainland China based on the data released on March 4, 2020. Approximately 3.2% of patients with COVID-19 required intubation and invasive ventilation at some point in the disease course. Providing best practices regarding intubation and ventilation for an overwhelming number of patients with COVID-19 amid an enhanced risk of cross-infection is a daunting undertaking. The authors presented the experience of caring for the critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan. It is extremely important to follow strict self-protection precautions. Timely, but not premature, intubation is crucial to counter a progressively enlarging oxygen debt despite high-flow oxygen therapy and bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. Thorough preparation, satisfactory preoxygenation, modified rapid sequence induction, and rapid intubation using a video laryngoscope are widely used intubation strategies in Wuhan. Lung-protective ventilation, prone position ventilation, and adequate sedation and analgesia are essential components of ventilation management."
covid-19,"Most reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged <18 years appear to be asymptomatic or mild (1). Less is known about severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization in children. During March 1-July 25, 2020, 576 pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported to the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), a population-based surveillance system that collects data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in 14 states (2,3). Based on these data, the cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate among children aged <18 years during March 1-July 25, 2020, was 8.0 per 100,000 population, with the highest rate among children aged <2 years (24.8). During March 21-July 25, weekly hospitalization rates steadily increased among children (from 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000, with a weekly high of 0.7 per 100,000). Overall, Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) and non-Hispanic black (black) children had higher cumulative rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (16.4 and 10.5 per 100,000, respectively) than did non-Hispanic white (white) children (2.1). Among 208 (36.1%) hospitalized children with complete medical chart reviews, 69 (33.2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU); 12 of 207 (5.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and one patient died during hospitalization. Although the cumulative rate of pediatric COVID-19-associated hospitalization remains low (8.0 per 100,000 population) compared with that among adults (164.5),* weekly rates increased during the surveillance period, and one in three hospitalized children were admitted to the ICU, similar to the proportion among adults. Continued tracking of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children is important to characterize morbidity and mortality. Reinforcement of prevention efforts is essential in congregate settings that serve children, including childcare centers and schools."
covid-19,"There are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical experience of pregnancies complicated with infection by other coronaviruses e.g. SARS and MERS, has led to pregnant woman being considered potentially vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physiological changes during pregnancy have a significant impact on the immune system, respiratory system, cardiovascular function and coagulation. These may have positive or negative effects on COVID-19 disease progression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy remains to be determined and a concerted, global effort is required to determine effects on implantation, fetal growth and development, labour and neonatal health. Asymptomatic infection presents a further challenge regarding service provision, prevention and management. As well as direct impacts of the disease, a plethora of indirect consequences of the pandemic will adversely affect maternal health including reduced access to reproductive health services, increased mental health strain and increased socioeconomic deprivation. In this review we explore the current knowledge of COVID-19 in pregnancy and signpost areas for further research to minimise its impact for women and their children."
covid-19,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is found to affect the mental health of the population. Undergraduate medical students are especially prone to mental health disorders and hence could be more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic. Methods A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on 217 undergraduate medical students in a medical college at Chennai, India. Depression, anxiety, and stress levels were recorded using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 Items (DASS21) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in India in December 2019 and June 2020, respectively. In the follow-up survey, in addition to DASS21, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality and a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of COVID-19 related stressors were used. The self-administered questionnaire assessed the status of COVID-19 testing, interactions with COVID-19 patients, self-perceived levels of concerns and worries related to academics (COVID-19-AA (academic apprehensions)) and those pertaining to the self and family/friends (COVID-19-GA (general apprehensions)). Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of overall scores of depression, anxiety, and stress and scores stratified by gender, year of study, place of residence and monthly family income were performed. Predictors for depression, anxiety, and stress during COVID-19 were investigated using adjusted binary logistic regression analysis and results were expressed as adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The average scores of depression, anxiety, and stress during the baseline survey were 7.55 ± 7.86, 4.6 ± 6.19 and 7.31 ± 7.34 with the prevalence (95% Cl) of 33.2% [27–39.9%], 21.2% [16–27.2%] and 20.7% [15.5–26.7%]; in follow-up survey, the mean scores were 8.16 ± 8.9, 6.11 ± 7.13 and 9.31 ± 8.18 with the prevalence being 35.5% [29.1–42.2%], 33.2% [27–39.9%] and 24.9% [19.3–31.2%] for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. There was a significant increase in both the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress (P < 0.001), with depression remaining unchanged during COVID-19, irrespective of gender, year of study, place of residence and family’s monthly income. Poor sleep quality, higher levels of baseline depression, anxiety, and stress, higher COVID-19-GA, COVID-19 patients in family/friends and direct interactions with COVID-19 patients were found to be significant predictors of negative mental health in undergraduate medical students. COVID-19-AA was not significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic appears to negatively affect the mental health of the undergraduate medical students with the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress being increased, and depression symptoms remaining unaltered. Addressing and mitigating the negative effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of this population is crucial."
covid-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has become a pandemic, but its reported characteristics and outcomes vary greatly amongst studies. We determined pooled estimates for clinical characteristics and outcomes in COVID‐19 patients including subgroups by disease severity (based on World Health Organization Interim Guidance Report or Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society criteria) and by country/region. We searched Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Chinese Medical Journal, and preprint databases from 1 January 2020 to 6 April 2020. Studies of laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 patients with relevant data were included. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction. From 6007 articles, 212 studies from 11 countries/regions involving 281 461 individuals were analyzed. Overall, mean age was 46.7 years, 51.8% were male, 22.9% had severe disease, and mortality was 5.6%. Underlying immunosuppression, diabetes, and malignancy were most strongly associated with severe COVID‐19 (coefficient =  53.9, 23.4, 23.4, respectively, all P < .0007), while older age, male gender, diabetes, and hypertension were also associated with higher mortality (coefficient = 0.05 per year, 5.1, 8.2, 6.99, respectively; P = .006‐.0002). Gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain) were associated with severe COVID‐19, while pneumonia and end‐organ failure were associated with mortality. COVID‐19 is associated with a severe disease course in about 23% and mortality in about 6% of infected persons. Individuals with comorbidities and clinical features associated with severity should be monitored closely, and preventive efforts should especially target those with diabetes, malignancy, and immunosuppression."

covid-19,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is this century’s largest public health emergency and its successful management relies on the effective dissemination of factual information. As a social media platform with billions of daily views, YouTube has tremendous potential to both support and hinder public health efforts. However, the usefulness and accuracy of most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 have not been investigated. Methods A YouTube search was performed on 21 March 2020 using keywords ‘coronavirus’ and ‘COVID-19’, and the top 75 viewed videos from each search were analysed. Videos that were duplicates, non-English, non-audio and non-visual, exceeding 1 hour in duration, live and unrelated to COVID-19 were excluded. Two reviewers coded the source, content and characteristics of included videos. The primary outcome was usability and reliability of videos, analysed using the novel COVID-19 Specific Score (CSS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) and modified JAMA (mJAMA) scores. Results Of 150 videos screened, 69 (46%) were included, totalling 257 804 146 views. Nineteen (27.5%) videos contained non-factual information, totalling 62 042 609 views. Government and professional videos contained only factual information and had higher CSS than consumer videos (mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.32, p=0.037); mDISCERN scores than consumer videos (MD 2.46, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.42, p=0.008), internet news videos (MD 2.20, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.21, p=0.027) and entertainment news videos (MD 2.57, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.49, p=0.004); and mJAMA scores than entertainment news videos (MD 1.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.36, p=0.033) and consumer videos (MD 1.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.44, p=0.028). However, they only accounted for 11% of videos and 10% of views. Conclusion Over one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 contained misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide. As the current COVID-19 pandemic worsens, public health agencies must better use YouTube to deliver timely and accurate information and to minimise the spread of misinformation. This may play a significant role in successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic."

Initial data pointed toward older individuals being particularly vulnerable, as well as those with diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular (including hypertension), respiratory, or kidney disease. These problems are often concentrated in certain racial groups (eg, African Americans and Asians), which also appear to be more prone to worse COVID-19 outcomes.1 Increasing numbers of reports have linked obesity to more severe COVID-19 illness and death.1–3 In a French study, the risk for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to the intensive treatment unit was more than 7-fold higher for those with body mass index (BMI) >35 compared with BMI <25 kg/m2.2 Among individuals with COVID-19 who were <60 years of age in New York City, those with a BMI between 30 to 34 kg/m2 and >35 kg/m2 were 1.8 times and 3.6 times more likely to be admitted to critical care, respectively, than individuals with a BMI <30 kg/m2.3 We suggest obesity or excess ectopic fat deposition may be a unifying risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection, reducing protective cardiorespiratory reserve as well as potentiating the immune dysregulation that appears, at least in part, to mediate the progression to critical illness and organ failure in a proportion of patients with COVID-19 (Figure). Whether obesity is an independent risk factor for susceptibility to infection requires further research. From a cardiovascular perspective, trial and genetic evidence conclusively show that obesity (and excess fat mass) are causally related to hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal disease, and heart failure. Obesity potentiates multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the premature development of cardiovascular disease, and adverse cardiorenal outcomes. There is also a metabolic concern. In individuals with diabetes mellitus, or at high risk of diabetes mellitus, obesity and excess ectopic fat lead to impairment of insulin resistance and reduced β-cell function. Both the latter limit ability to evoke an appropriate metabolic response on immunologic challenge, leading some patients with diabetes mellitus to require substantial amounts of insulin during severe infections. Overall, the integrated regulation of metabolism required for the complex cellular interactions, and for effective host defense, is lost, leading to functional immunologic deficit. COVID-19 may also directly disrupt pancreatic β-cell function through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, obesity enhances thrombosis, which is relevant given the association between severe COVID-19 and prothrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation and high rates of venous thromboembolism. Beyond cardiometabolic and thrombotic consequences, obesity has detrimental effects on lung function, diminishing forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity (Figure). Higher relative fat mass is also linked to such adverse changes, perhaps relevant to emerging reports of greater critical illness from COVID-19 in © 2020 American Heart Association, Inc. ON MY MIND"
covid-19,"Flow physics plays a key role in nearly every facet of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes the generation and aerosolization of virus-laden respiratory droplets from a host, its airborne dispersion and deposition on surfaces, as well as the subsequent inhalation of these bioaerosols by unsuspecting recipients. Fluid dynamics is also key to preventative measures such as the use of face masks, hand washing, ventilation of indoor environments and even social distancing. This article summarizes what we know and, more importantly, what we need to learn about the science underlying these issues so that we are better prepared to tackle the next outbreak of COVID-19 or a similar disease."
covid-19,"Objective To determine the pooled global prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Data Sources Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Review Methods Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19. Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening. Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed. Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated. Results Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19. Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence. Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively. Conclusions Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection. Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients."
covid-19,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education and healthcare systems worldwide. The disease can cause life-threatening conditions and it presents challenges for medical education, as instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience. These measures could then be followed by hands-on experience that is provided in a safe environment."
covid-19,"This article aims to analyze the implementation of teleworking as a security practice to face the crisis resulting from the Covid-19 disease. The present paper provides both theoretical and practical results. From a theoretical standpoint, the Baruch and Nicholson approach is extended with environmental, safety, and legal factors that explain telework. From a practical perspective, a database of companies that have introduced telework as a measure to face coronavirus in a crisis context has been obtained. In short, the Covid-19 crisis demonstrates how teleworking has been used by companies to ensure their employees’ safety and to provide continuity to economic activity. Consequently, safety factors are relevant in the study of teleworking and should be considered in further research."
covid-19,"Rationale: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global threat to health. Its inflammatory characteristics are incompletely understood. Objectives: To define the cytokine profile of COVID-19 and to identify evidence of immunometabolic alterations in those with severe illness. Methods: Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and sTNFR1 (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) were assessed in plasma from healthy volunteers, hospitalized but stable patients with COVID-19 (COVIDstable patients), patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission (COVIDICU patients), and patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU support (CAPICU patients). Immunometabolic markers were measured in circulating neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19. The acute phase response of AAT (alpha-1 antitrypsin) to COVID-19 was also evaluated. Measurements and Main Results: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and sTNFR1 were all increased in patients with COVID-19. COVIDICU patients could be clearly differentiated from COVIDstable patients, and demonstrated higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and sTNFR1 but lower IL-10 than CAPICU patients. COVID-19 neutrophils displayed altered immunometabolism, with increased cytosolic PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), phosphorylated PKM2, HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α), and lactate. The production and sialylation of AAT increased in COVID-19, but this antiinflammatory response was overwhelmed in severe illness, with the IL-6:AAT ratio markedly higher in patients requiring ICU admission (P < 0.0001). In critically unwell patients with COVID-19, increases in IL-6:AAT predicted prolonged ICU stay and mortality, whereas improvement in IL-6:AAT was associated with clinical resolution (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 cytokinemia is distinct from that of other types of pneumonia, leading to organ failure and ICU need. Neutrophils undergo immunometabolic reprogramming in severe COVID-19 illness. Cytokine ratios may predict outcomes in this population."
covid-19,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat. However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected ≥24 hours apart. We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 ± 3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3 ± 2.2 bowel movements per day. Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P < 0.001). Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P < 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms. These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms."
covid-19,"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic cause by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens the world. We read with interest the recent report by Li et al. that included 610 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). They reported a high false-negative rate of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 detection. In addition, recent report regarding SARS-CoV-2 ""turn positive"" in recovered cases with COVID-19 were published. Here, we studied the characteristics of nucleic acid conversion for SARS-CoV-2 from 70 COVID-19 patients. We found that 15 (21.4%) patients experienced a ""turn positive"" of nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 after two consecutive negative results, which may be related to the false negative of RT-PCR test and prolonged nucleic acid conversion This article is protected by copyright.

covid-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) caused by the novel Coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 is currently a pandemic. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the CoViD-19 outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. The virus has already had a direct impact on the physical health of million people, and besides, it is supposed to pose a mental health threat of great magnitude globally. This review aims at synthesizing mounting evidence concerning the immediate psychological responses during the initial stage of the CoViD-19 pandemic among the general population, the health-care workers, and clinical populations. Experts point out the need to pay specific attention to other groups at risk of further distress that may need tailored interventions. Providing psychological first aid is an essential care component for populations that have been victims of emergencies and disasters, before, during and after the event. With the aim of dealing better with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the CoViD-19 pandemic, a new psychological crisis intervention model is needed. Given the recommendation to minimize face-to-face interaction, online mental health services have been widely adopted in China and are urged in other countries."
covid-19,"Abstract Background The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly spreading nationwide and abroad. A serologic test to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed. Methods The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after symptom onset. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The serodiagnostic power of the specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and consistency rate. Results The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the 4th day after symptom onset. In the confirmed patients with COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, and those of IgG were 83.3.3% (55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9 %. In patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5% (21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24), 96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%. Both antibodies performed well in serodiagnosis for COVID-19 rely on great specificity. Conclusions The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle and later stage of the illness. Antibody detection may play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as complement approach for viral nucleid acid assays."
covid-19,"ABSTRACT As the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has amplified so has country responses to it. With COVID-19 taking its toll on humans, as reflected in the number of people infected by, and deaths from, COVID-19, countries responded by locking down economic activity and peoples movement, imposing travel bans, and implementing stimulus packages to cushion the unprecedented slowdown in economic activity and loss of jobs. This article provides a commentary on how the most active financial indicator – namely, the stock price – reacted in real-time to different stages in COVID-19’s evolution. We argue that, as with any unexpected news, markets over-react and as more information becomes available and people understand the ramifications more broadly the market corrects itself. This is our hypothesis which needs robust empirical verification."
covid-19,"ABSTRACT The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics."

covid-19,"In the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it is abundantly clear to all the necessity of studying the pathology and widespread health consequences associated with the virus. However, what is much less clear is the impact of COVID-19 on medical education. Already, faculty and medical students are grappling with the changes that have been made and attempting to consolidate these with their plan of career development. Changes that may seem relatively minor in comparison to the global pandemic have the potential to be drastic turning points in the career progression of many. As not much is known regarding the long-lasting impact of COVID-19 on medical education, it is therefore also necessary to record and study the full impact of the changes being made. The path to entering a successful residency has been predictable for the last few years - do well on Step 1, give conference presentations, go the extra mile in clerkships and shadowing opportunities, and have meaningful non-academic extracurricular activities - all of which designed to best demonstrate a student's knowledge, persistence, collaborative spirit, and dedication to medicine. This trajectory has been changed with COVID-19 disrupting routines in hospitals, medical schools and beyond. The replacement of in-person classes with online equivalents is an obvious necessity at this time but creates a loss of collaborative experiences that has the potential to be a significant detriment to education. Likewise, the cancellation of clerkships, which are necessary for both skill acquisition as well as for relationship building, is a serious issue which students and medical schools must now resolve. Many medical students have also lost the opportunity for personal development through conference presentations. These presentations play a large role in distinguishing applicants during the residency application process, and therefore these lost opportunities have the potential to be a serious detriment to medical students’ career trajectory. While implementing technology to help resolve these issues is a unique way to help students to develop these skills, it is now necessary for medical students to demonstrate the same set of skills which they would have previously in a completely new and innovative manner. Persistence and adaptability during this time of challenge are attributes that medical students can demonstrate more readily. While every student has a personal story of how COVID-19 has impacted their education, there is no question that the impacts of COVID-19 will be felt on an extensive level. The panic in the community is palpable, and many are confused by how to proceed in the wake of COVID-19. This is no different for medical students and faculty and the questions that arise regarding medical education and their future careers."
covid-19,"ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection."
covid-19,"ABSTRACT The study examined the relationship between perception of COVID-19, travel risk perception and travel behaviour among travellers in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) – an important tourism market and, after Italy, the second region in Europe that was impacted by COVID-19. Data were collected at two points of time: the sample of the study in Period 1 (n = 1158) was collected at a critical point in time in the beginning of March 2020, when Italy was already massively affected by COVID-19; the sample of the study in Period 2 (n = 212) was collected two weeks later, when Europe has seen immense impacts and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Cluster analysis was performed and defined three unique clusters in both periods with distinctive characteristics. In addition, results revealed a significant increase in risk perception of COVID-19, travel risk perception and travel behaviour over a short period of time."
covid-19,"Some patients with severe COVID-19 develop prothrombotic autoantibodies that are similar to antiphospholipid antibodies found in autoimmune diseases. Casting an autoantibody NET in COVID-19 Patients with severe COVID-19 are at high risk for occlusion of blood vessels of all sizes. This prothrombotic phenotype is reminiscent of patients with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, who have long-lived circulating antiphospholipid autoantibodies. In new work, Zuo et al. measured eight types of antiphospholipid antibodies in serum from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and found at least one antibody in half of patients. Antibody levels were associated with neutrophil and coagulation pathway activation. Purified antibodies from some patients activated neutrophils in vitro and potentiated thrombosis when injected into mice. Together, these findings suggest that autoantibodies are a potential therapeutic target in severe COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. Lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based blockages in the small blood vessels of patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins (aPL antibodies). Case series have recently detected aPL antibodies in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL antibodies in serum samples from 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These aPL antibodies included anticardiolipin IgG, IgM, and IgA; anti–β2 glycoprotein I IgG, IgM, and IgA; and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG and IgM. We detected aPS/PT IgG in 24% of serum samples, anticardiolipin IgM in 23% of samples, and aPS/PT IgM in 18% of samples. Antiphospholipid autoantibodies were present in 52% of serum samples using the manufacturer’s threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (≥40 ELISA-specific units). Higher titers of aPL antibodies were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), higher platelet counts, more severe respiratory disease, and lower clinical estimated glomerular filtration rate. Similar to IgG from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from neutrophils isolated from healthy individuals. Furthermore, injection of IgG purified from COVID-19 patient serum into mice accelerated venous thrombosis in two mouse models. These findings suggest that half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL antibodies and that these autoantibodies are potentially pathogenic."
covid-19,"Background: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. Subjects and methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the «Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)» Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses «before» and «during» confinement conditions. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day. Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly. Summary: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement."
covid-19,"In December 2019, the world started to face a new pandemic situation, the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Although coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported. Cardiac manifestations etiology seems to be multifactorial, comprising direct viral myocardial damage, hypoxia, hypotension, enhanced inflammatory status, ACE2‐receptors downregulation, drug toxicity, endogenous catecholamine adrenergic status, among others. Studies evaluating patients with COVID‐19 presenting cardiac injury markers show that it is associated with poorer outcomes, and arrhythmic events are not uncommon. Besides, drugs currently used to treat the COVID‐19 are known to prolong the QT interval and can have a proarrhythmic propensity. This review focus on COVID‐19 cardiac and arrhythmic manifestations and, in parallel, makes an appraisal of other virus epidemics as SARS‐CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and H1N1 influenza."

Data are lacking whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).


Objective
To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.


Design, Setting, and Participants
Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020.


Main Outcomes and Measures
COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors.


Results
Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs. The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34). Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs.


Conclusions and Relevance
This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients. These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic."

covid-19,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging serious global health problem. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool specimens. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and disease remains to be established. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 COVID-19 patients, 24 influenza A (H1N1) patients, and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. Results Compared with HC, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces, and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts. Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89. Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers were selected to distinguish the two cohorts with an AUC of 0.94. Conclusion The gut microbial signature of patients with COVID-19 was different from that of H1N1 patients and HC. Our study suggests the potential value of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for COVID-19, but further validation is needed."

It is uncertain whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke than would be expected from a viral respiratory infection.


Objective
To compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with COVID-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously associated with stroke.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 2 academic hospitals in New York City, New York, and included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with COVID-19 from March 4, 2020, through May 2, 2020. The comparison cohort included adults with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with influenza A/B from January 1, 2016, through May 31, 2018 (spanning moderate and severe influenza seasons).


Exposures
COVID-19 infection confirmed by evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the nasopharynx by polymerase chain reaction and laboratory-confirmed influenza A/B.


Main Outcomes and Measures
A panel of neurologists adjudicated the primary outcome of acute ischemic stroke and its clinical characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of patients with COVID-19 with ischemic stroke vs the proportion among patients with influenza.


Results
Among 1916 patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with COVID-19, 31 (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.1%-2.3%) had an acute ischemic stroke. The median age of patients with stroke was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-78 years); 18 (58%) were men. Stroke was the reason for hospital presentation in 8 cases (26%). In comparison, 3 of 1486 patients with influenza (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.6%) had an acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was higher with COVID-19 infection than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.3-25.2). The association persisted across sensitivity analyses adjusting for vascular risk factors, viral symptomatology, and intensive care unit admission.


Conclusions and Relevance
In this retrospective cohort study from 2 New York City academic hospitals, approximately 1.6% of adults with COVID-19 who visited the emergency department or were hospitalized experienced ischemic stroke, a higher rate of stroke compared with a cohort of patients with influenza. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to investigate possible thrombotic mechanisms associated with COVID-19."
covid-19,"Concerns have been expressed that persons with a pre‐existing mental disorder may represent a population at increased risk for COVID‐19 infection and with a higher likelihood of adverse outcomes of the infection, but there is no systematic research evidence in this respect. This study assessed the impact of a recent (within past year) diagnosis of a mental disorder – including attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia – on the risk for COVID‐19 infection and related mortality and hospitalization rates. We analyzed a nation‐wide database of electronic health records of 61 million adult patients from 360 hospitals and 317,000 providers, across 50 states in the US, up to July 29, 2020. Patients with a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder had a significantly increased risk for COVID‐19 infection, an effect strongest for depression (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=7.64, 95% CI: 7.45‐7.83, p<0.001) and schizophrenia (AOR=7.34, 95% CI: 6.65‐8.10, p<0.001). Among patients with a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder, African Americans had higher odds of COVID‐19 infection than Caucasians, with the strongest ethnic disparity for depression (AOR=3.78, 95% CI: 3.58‐3.98, p<0.001). Women with mental disorders had higher odds of COVID‐19 infection than males, with the strongest gender disparity for ADHD (AOR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.73‐2.39, p<0.001). Patients with both a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder and COVID‐19 infection had a death rate of 8.5% (vs. 4.7% among COVID‐19 patients with no mental disorder, p<0.001) and a hospitalization rate of 27.4% (vs. 18.6% among COVID‐19 patients with no mental disorder, p<0.001). These findings identify individuals with a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder as being at increased risk for COVID‐19 infection, which is further exacerbated among African Americans and women, and as having a higher frequency of some adverse outcomes of the infection. This evidence highlights the need to identify and address modifiable vulnerability factors for COVID‐19 infection and to prevent delays in health care provision in this population."
covid-19,"ABSTRACT The dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed in coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown. COVID-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled to evaluate the effect of RAS inhibitors. We observed that patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower rate of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of IL-6 in peripheral blood. In addition, ACEI or ARB therapy increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral blood and decreased the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs. This evidence supports the benefit of using ACEIs or ARBs to potentially contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension."

covid-19,"The public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has illustrated that it is possible to contain COVID-19 if governments focus on tried and tested public health outbreak responses.1,2 Isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures were rapidly implemented. In China, patients with COVID-19 were immediately isolated in designated existing hospitals, and new hospitals were rapidly built to manage the increasing numbers of cases in the most affected areas. Home quarantine for contacts was initiated and large gatherings were canceled. Additionally, community containment for approximately 40 million to 60 million residents was instituted. A significant positive association between the incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality was apparent in the Chinese response.3 That is, the rapid escalation in the number of infections in China had resulted in insufficient health care resources, followed by an increase in mortality. The association of mortality with health care resources should provide guidance for resource-limited regions on how and when to prepare for possible local outbreaks.3 In addition, lessons learned from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) outbreak geared toward strengthening of public health systems will be helpful."
covid-19,"To evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcome by performing a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID‐19."
covid-19,"Key Points Question: Assuming social distancing measures are maintained, what are the forecasted gaps in available health service resources and number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic for each state in the United States? Findings: Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months. Meaning: Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities. Abstract Importance: This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US. Objective: To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. Exposure(s): COVID-19. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6. Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths."
covid-19,"The current COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and rapidly extended to become a global sanitary and economic emergency. Its etiological agent is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, which ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe pneumonia accompanied by multisystemic failure that can lead to a patient's death. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is known to involve all the components of the immune system that together appear responsible for viral elimination and recovery from the infection. Nonetheless, such immune responses are implicated in the disease's progression to a more severe and lethal process. This review describes the general aspects of both COVID-19 and its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, stressing the similarities with other severe coronavirus infections, such as SARS and MERS, but more importantly, pointing toward the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is a consequence of the corresponding variable spectrum of the immune responses to the virus. The critical point where progression of the disease ensues appears to center on loss of the immune regulation between protective and altered responses due to exacerbation of the inflammatory components. Finally, it appears possible to delineate certain major challenges deserving of exhaustive investigation to further understand COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, thus helping to design more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic strategies."
covid-19,"Abstract Background The coronavirus [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] pandemic has introduced extraordinary life changes and stress, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Initial reports suggest that depression and anxiety are elevated during COVID-19, but no prior study has explored changes at the within-person level. The current study explored changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from before the pandemic to soon after it first peaked in Spring 2020 in a sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 451) living in Long Island, New York, an early epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S. Methods Depression (Children's Depression Inventory) and anxiety symptoms (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Symptoms) were assessed between December 2014 and July 2019, and, along with COVID-19 experiences, symptoms were re-assessed between March 27th and May 15th, 2020. Results Across participants and independent of age, there were increased generalized anxiety and social anxiety symptoms. In females, there were also increased depression and panic/somatic symptoms. Multivariable linear regression indicated that greater COVID-19 school concerns were uniquely associated with increased depression symptoms. Greater COVID-19 home confinement concerns were uniquely associated with increased generalized anxiety symptoms, and decreased social anxiety symptoms, respectively. Conclusions Adolescents and young adults at an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. experienced increased depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly amongst females. School and home confinement concerns related to the pandemic were independently associated with changes in symptoms. Overall, this report suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is having multifarious adverse effects on the mental health of youth."
covid-19,"As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification."
covid-19,"What will be the global impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19."
covid-19,"Abstract Stay-at-home mandates and quarantines related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have led to greatly increased participation in online gaming. Initiatives such as #PlayApartTogether that promote gaming for socializing and stress reduction may achieve positive outcomes. Although gaming can be a healthy coping strategy for the majority, it can also pose risks to some vulnerable individuals. Protracted periods of social isolation and technology-based activity pose the danger of solidifying unhealthy lifestyle patterns, leading to difficulties to readaptation when the COVID-19 crisis has passed. Balanced and effective approaches to gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed to support physical and psychological wellbeing."
covid-19,"Interleukin-6 is an important marker of inflammation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to demonstrate the association of elevated IL-6 with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). A total of 9 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher serum IL-6 levels compared to non-severe patients (mean difference (MD): 38.6 pg/mL, 95% CI: 24.3 - 52.9 pg/mL, p <0.001, I2 = 98.5%). On meta-regression, increasing mean IL-6 level was associated with increased mortality in patients (Coefficient (Q): 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01-0.03, p = 0.03). Given the association of elevated IL-6 with severe COVID-19 and mortality, clinicians should use this as a potential marker to recognize severe disease. IL-6 should be incorporated in a scoring system along with other inflammatory markers to risk stratify the patients for early recognition of severe disease. Our study should encourage researchers to conduct trial evaluating Anti IL-6 antibodies such as Tocilizumab to assess the efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19.

covid-19,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with its early origin from Wuhan city in China has evolved into a global pandemic. Maximal precautionary measures and resources have been put forward by most nations in war footing to mitigate transmission and decrease fatality rates. This article was aimed to review the evidence on clinical management and to deal with the identification of high-risk groups, warning signs, appropriate investigations, proper sample collection for confirmation, general and specific treatment measures, strategies as well as infection control in the healthcare settings. Advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been found to be the risk factors for severe disease. Fever lasting for >five days with tachypnoea, tachycardia or hypotension are indications for urgent attention and hospitalization in a patient with suspected COVID-19. At present, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper respiratory tract samples is the diagnostic test of choice. While many drugs have shown in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are insufficient clinical data to promote or dissuade their usage. Among the currently available drugs, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir may be considered for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, awaiting further clinical trials. Stringent droplet and contact precautions will protect healthcare workers against most clinical exposures to COVID-19."
covid-19,"In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, began in Wuhan, China (1). The disease spread widely in China, and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in 36 other countries and territories, including the United States. Person-to-person transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of countries have reported sustained person-to-person spread.* On January 20, state and local health departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed from CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had close contact† with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (2). The aims of these efforts were to ensure rapid evaluation and care of patients, limit further transmission, and better understand risk factors for transmission."
covid-19,"Key Points Question Among children with a COVID-19 diagnosis, what conditions are common, and which are associated with severe COVID-19 illness? Findings In this cross-sectional study of 43 465 patients aged 18 years or younger with COVID-19, more than one-quarter had 1 or more underlying condition; asthma, obesity, neurodevelopmental disorders, and certain mental health conditions were most common. Certain conditions as well as medical complexity were associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Meaning These findings expand the knowledge available regarding children with COVID-19 and could inform pediatric clinical practice and public health priorities, such as prevention and mitigation of COVID-19."
covid-19,"SARS-CoV-2 infects the olfactory epithelium of hamsters and humans and persists in it in individuals with COVID-19 for several months after infection. Sticking the nose into COVID-19 Patients with COVID-19 can develop loss of smell and/or taste. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of these alterations remains unclear. Here, de Melo et al. examined the olfactory mucosa in patients with COVID-19 reporting loss of smell and detected SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and inflammation in multiple cell types in the olfactory neuroepithelium, including olfactory sensory neurons. Hamster infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed loss of smell that was associated with dissemination of the virus in the olfactory mucosa and CNS and with neuroinflammation. In four patients who developed persistent loss of smell, the authors detected lasting SARS-CoV-2 presence in the olfactory mucosa, suggesting that the prolonged relapsing anosmia in patients with COVID-19 could be due to persistent viral infection. Whereas recent investigations have revealed viral, inflammatory, and vascular factors involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lung pathogenesis, the pathophysiology of neurological disorders in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains poorly understood. Olfactory and taste dysfunction are common in COVID-19, especially in mildly symptomatic patients. Here, we conducted a virologic, molecular, and cellular study of the olfactory neuroepithelium of seven patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute loss of smell. We report evidence that the olfactory neuroepithelium is a major site of SARS-CoV2 infection with multiple cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells, and immune cells, becoming infected. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the olfactory neuroepithelium was associated with local inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced acute anosmia and ageusia in golden Syrian hamsters, lasting as long as the virus remained in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Last, olfactory mucosa sampling from patients showing long-term persistence of COVID-19–associated anosmia revealed the presence of virus transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2–infected cells, together with protracted inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 persistence and associated inflammation in the olfactory neuroepithelium may account for prolonged or relapsing symptoms of COVID-19, such as loss of smell, which should be considered for optimal medical management of this disease."
covid-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has led to an unprecedented setback for global economy and health. Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions to substantially reduce severe disease and death due to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Vaccination programmes are being rolled out globally, but most of these vaccines have been approved without extensive studies on their side‐effects and efficacy. Recently, new‐onset autoimmune phenomena after COVID‐19 vaccination have been reported increasingly (e.g. immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, autoimmune liver diseases, Guillain–Barré syndrome, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Molecular mimicry, the production of particular autoantibodies and the role of certain vaccine adjuvants seem to be substantial contributors to autoimmune phenomena. However, whether the association between COVID‐19 vaccine and autoimmune manifestations is coincidental or causal remains to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the emerging evidence about autoimmune manifestations occurring in response to certain COVID‐19 vaccines. Although information pertaining to the risk of autoimmune disease as a consequence of vaccination is controversial, we merely propose our current understanding of autoimmune manifestations associated with COVID‐19 vaccine. In fact, we do not aim to disavow the overwhelming benefits of mass COVID‐19 vaccination in preventing COVID‐19 morbidity and mortality. These reports could help guide clinical assessment and management of autoimmune manifestations after COVID‐19 vaccination."
covid-19,"The first vaccines for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States were authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (1) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in December 2020.* However, demand for COVID-19 vaccines is expected to exceed supply during the first months of the national COVID-19 vaccination program. ACIP advises CDC on population groups and circumstances for vaccine use.† On December 1, ACIP recommended that 1) health care personnel§ and 2) residents of long-term care facilities¶ be offered COVID-19 vaccination first, in Phase 1a of the vaccination program (2). On December 20, 2020, ACIP recommended that in Phase 1b, vaccine should be offered to persons aged ≥75 years and frontline essential workers (non-health care workers), and that in Phase 1c, persons aged 65-74 years, persons aged 16-64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and essential workers not recommended for vaccination in Phase 1b should be offered vaccine.** These recommendations for phased allocation provide guidance for federal, state, and local jurisdictions while vaccine supply is limited. In its deliberations, ACIP considered scientific evidence regarding COVID-19 epidemiology, ethical principles, and vaccination program implementation considerations. ACIP's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine allocation are interim and might be updated based on changes in conditions of FDA Emergency Use Authorization, FDA authorization for new COVID-19 vaccines, changes in vaccine supply, or changes in COVID-19 epidemiology."
covid-19,"As of January 3, 2021, a total of 20,346,372 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 349,246 associated deaths have been reported in the United States. Long-term sequalae of COVID-19 over the course of a lifetime currently are unknown; however, persistent symptoms and serious complications are being reported among COVID-19 survivors, including persons who initially experience a mild acute illness.* On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days. On December 12, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (1); initial doses were recommended for health care personnel and long-term care facility residents (2). As of December 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the United States, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) adverse events after receipt of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Among these, 175 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that does occur rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (3). Twenty-one cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 11.1 per million doses administered), including 17 in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, seven of whom had a history of anaphylaxis. The median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 13 minutes (range = 2-150 minutes). Among 20 persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. Of the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 86 were judged to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 61 were considered nonallergic adverse events. Seven case reports were still under investigation. This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine during December 14-23, 2020, in the United States. CDC has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States (4) and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis (5). In addition to screening for contraindications and precautions before administering COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies available to manage anaphylaxis, should implement postvaccination observation periods, and should immediately treat persons experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms with intramuscular injection of epinephrine (4,5)."
covid-19,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on this topic and made a summary of current development and future perspectives."

covid-19,"Background The infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing global healthcare challenge. Up to one-third of hospitalised patients develop severe pulmonary complications and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary outcomes following COVID-19 are unknown. Methods The Swiss COVID-19 lung study is a multicentre prospective cohort investigating pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19. We report on initial follow-up 4 months after mild/moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization severity classification. Results 113 COVID-19 survivors were included (mild/moderate n=47, severe/critical n=66). We confirmed several comorbidities as risk factors for severe/critical disease. Severe/critical disease was associated with impaired pulmonary function, i.e. diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) % predicted, reduced 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. After adjustment for potential confounding by age, sex and body mass index (BMI), patients after severe/critical COVID-19 had a DLCO 20.9% pred (95% CI 12.4–29.4% pred, p=0.01) lower at follow-up. DLCO % pred was the strongest independent factor associated with previous severe/critical disease when age, sex, BMI, 6MWD and minimal peripheral oxygen saturation at exercise were included in the multivariable model (adjusted odds ratio per 10% predicted 0.59, 95% CI 0. 37–0.87; p=0.01). Mosaic hypoattenuation on chest computed tomography at follow-up was significantly associated with previous severe/critical COVID-19 including adjustment for age and sex (adjusted OR 11.7, 95% CI 1.7–239; p=0.03). Conclusions 4 months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, severe/critical COVID-19 was associated with significant functional and radiological abnormalities, potentially due to small-airway and lung parenchymal disease. A systematic follow-up for survivors needs to be evaluated to optimise care for patients recovering from COVID-19. COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae are unknown. The Swiss COVID-19 lung study reports on initial follow-up findings. Severe or critical COVID-19 was associated with significant functional impairment and radiological abnormalities after 4 months. https://bit.ly/34sNVvi"
covid-19,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by systemic hyper-inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure. Cytokine storm refers to a set of clinical conditions caused by excessive immune reactions and has been recognized as a leading cause of severe COVID-19. While comparisons have been made between COVID-19 cytokine storm and other kinds of cytokine storm such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome, the pathogenesis of cytokine storm has not been clearly elucidated yet. Recent studies have shown that impaired response of type-1 IFNs in early stage of COVID-19 infection played a major role in the development of cytokine storm, and various cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 were involved in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, many clinical evidences have indicated the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy in severe COVID-19. Several approaches are currently being used to treat the observed cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and expectations are especially high for new cytokine-targeted therapies, such as tocilizumab, anakinra, and baricitinib. Although a number of studies have been conducted on anti-inflammatory treatments for severe COVID-19, no specific recommendations have been made on which drugs should be used for which patients and when. In this review, we provide an overview of cytokine storm in COVID-19 and treatments currently being used to address it. In addition, we discuss the potential therapeutic role of extracorporeal cytokine removal to treat the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19."
covid-19,"Vaccine hesitancy forms a critical barrier to the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine in high-income countries or regions. This review aims to summarize rates of COVID-19 hesitancy and its determinants in high-income countries or regions. A scoping review was conducted in Medline®, Embase®, CINAHL®, and Scopus® and was reported in accordance with the PRISMA-SCr checklist. The search was current as of March 2021. Studies which evaluated COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its determinants in high-income countries (US$12,536 or more GNI per capita in 2019) were included. Studies conducted in low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries or regions were excluded. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were grouped into four themes (vaccine specific, individual, group, or contextual related factors). Of 2237 articles retrieved, 97 articles were included in this review. Most studies were conducted in U.S. (n = 39) and Italy (n = 9). The rates of vaccine hesitancy across high-income countries or regions ranged from 7–77.9%. 46 studies (47.4%) had rates of 30% and more. Younger age, females, not being of white ethnicity and lower education were common contextual factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Lack of recent history of influenza vaccination, lower self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, lesser fear of COVID-19, believing that COVID-19 is not severe and not having chronic medical conditions were most frequently studied individual/group factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Common vaccine-specific factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy included beliefs that vaccine are not safe/effective and increased concerns about rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the heterogeneity in vaccine hesitancy definitions used across studies, there is a need for standardization in its assessment. This review has summarized COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy determinants that national policymakers can use when formulating health policies related to COVID-19 vaccination."
evolution,"Mitochondrial DNA was purified from four species of higher primates (Guinea baboon, rhesus macaque, guenon, and human) and digested with 11 restriction endonucleases. A cleavage map was constructed for the mitochondrial DNA of each species. Comparison of the maps, aligned with respect to the origin and direction of DNA replication, revealed that the species differ from one another at most of the cleavage sites. The degree of divergence in nucleotide sequence at these sites was calculated from the fraction of cleavage sites shared by each pair of species. By plotting the degree of divergence in mitochondrial DNA against time of divergence, the rate of base substitution could be calculated from the initial slope of the curve. The value obtained, 0.02 substitutions per base pair per million years, was compared with the value for single-copy nuclear DNA. The rate of evolution of the mitochondrial genome appears to exceed that of the single-copy fraction of the nuclear genome by a factor of about 10. This high rate may be due, in part, to an elevated rate of mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Because of the high rate of evolution, mitochondrial DNA is likely to be an extremely useful molecule to employ for high-resolution analysis of the evolutionary process."
evolution,"Foreword This author maintains that growing organizations move through five distinguishable phases of development, each of which contains a relatively calm period of growth that ends with a management crisis. He argues, moreover, that since each phase is strongly influenced by the previous one, a management with a sense of its own organization's history can anticipate and prepare for the next developmental crisis. This article provides a prescription for appropriate management action in each of the five phases, and it shows how companies can turn organizational crises into opportunities for the future growth. Mr. Greiner is associate professor of organizational behavior at the Harvard Business School and the author of several Harvard Business Review articles on organization development."
evolution,"Level set methods have been widely used in image processing and computer vision. In conventional level set formulations, the level set function typically develops irregularities during its evolution, which may cause numerical errors and eventually destroy the stability of the evolution. Therefore, a numerical remedy, called reinitialization, is typically applied to periodically replace the degraded level set function with a signed distance function. However, the practice of reinitialization not only raises serious problems as when and how it should be performed, but also affects numerical accuracy in an undesirable way. This paper proposes a new variational level set formulation in which the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically maintained during the level set evolution. The level set evolution is derived as the gradient flow that minimizes an energy functional with a distance regularization term and an external energy that drives the motion of the zero level set toward desired locations. The distance regularization term is defined with a potential function such that the derived level set evolution has a unique forward-and-backward (FAB) diffusion effect, which is able to maintain a desired shape of the level set function, particularly a signed distance profile near the zero level set. This yields a new type of level set evolution called distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE). The distance regularization effect eliminates the need for reinitialization and thereby avoids its induced numerical errors. In contrast to complicated implementations of conventional level set formulations, a simpler and more efficient finite difference scheme can be used to implement the DRLSE formulation. DRLSE also allows the use of more general and efficient initialization of the level set function. In its numerical implementation, relatively large time steps can be used in the finite difference scheme to reduce the number of iterations, while ensuring sufficient numerical accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLSE formulation, we apply it to an edge-based active contour model for image segmentation, and provide a simple narrowband implementation to greatly reduce computational cost."

evolution,"Wireless microsensor networks have been identified as one of the most important technologies for the 21st century. This paper traces the history of research in sensor networks over the past three decades, including two important programs of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) spanning this period: the Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) and the Sensor Information Technology (SensIT) programs. Technology trends that impact the development of sensor networks are reviewed, and new applications such as infrastructure security, habitat monitoring, and traffic control are presented. Technical challenges in sensor network development include network discovery, control and routing, collaborative signal and information processing, tasking and querying, and security. The paper concludes by presenting some recent research results in sensor network algorithms, including localized algorithms and directed diffusion, distributed tracking in wireless ad hoc networks, and distributed classification using local agents."
evolution,"How do real graphs evolve over time? What are normal growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.
 Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).
 Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.
 We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.
 Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution."
evolution,"The author shows how a group of individuals can learn to play a coordination game without any common knowledge and with only a small amount of rationality. The game is repeated many times by different players. Each player chooses an optimal reply based on incomplete information about what other players have done in the past. Occasionally they make mistakes. When the likelihood of mistakes is very small, typically one coordination equilibrium will be played almost all of the time over the long run. This stochastically stable equilibrium can be computed analytically using a general theorem the author proves on perturbed Markov processes. Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society."
evolution,"Abstract Environmental niche models, which are generated by combining species occurrence data with environmental GIS data layers, are increasingly used to answer fundamental questions about niche evolution, speciation, and the accumulation of ecological diversity within clades. The question of whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic study of niche conservatism between sister species in several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time, address alternative definitions of “niche conservatism” within a single framework using consistent methods. As expected, we find that environmental niches of sister species are more similar than expected under three distinct null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in this group to consist of closely related species. We suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology."
evolution,"The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction is catalyzed most effectively by the Pt group metals. As H2 is considered as a future energy carrier, the need for these catalysts will increase and alternatives to the scarce and expensive Pt group catalysts will be needed. We analyze the ability of different metal surfaces and of the enzymes nitrogenase and hydrogenase to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction and find a necessary criterion for high catalytic activity. The necessary criterion is that the binding free energy of atomic hydrogen to the catalyst is close to zero. The criterion enables us to search for new catalysts, and inspired by the nitrogenase active site, we find that MoS2 nanoparticles supported on graphite are a promising catalyst. They catalyze electrochemical hydrogen evolution at a moderate overpotential of 0.1-0.2 V."
evolution,"Darwin (1859, pp. 11-14, 143-150) stressed the evolutionary importance of covariation between characters in populations and its ""most imperfectly understood"" connection with correlated responses to artificial and natural selection. After the turn of the century the discoveries of pervasive pleiotropy and linkage of Mendelian factors revealed the underlying genetic mechanisms. Existing theory on the dynamics of correlated characters has been developed in the limited framework of practical plant and animal breeding. Methods of multivariate analysis, functional analysis and optimality criteria popular among evolutionists, do not account for dynamical constraints imposed by the pattern of genetic variation within populations. Consideration of phenotypic variation often does not suggest any clear mechanism connecting growth patterns or adult variation to interspecific evolution. When there is individual variation in development, no necessary correspondence exists between ontogenetic and adult variation in a population (Cock, 1966, pp. 148-15 1). It is also common for the pattern of adult variation within a species to differ from that at higher taxonomic levels (Simpson, 1953, pp. 25-29). An example which will be investigated here is the brain weight:body weight relationship. At various taxonomic levels, brain and body weights tend to follow the allometric equation"
evolution,"Gene duplicates are prevalent in plants and in some cases contribute to evolutionary novelty. Ancient duplication events and a high rate of retention of extant pairs of duplicate genes have contributed to an abundance of duplicate genes in plant genomes. These duplicates have contributed to the evolution of novel functions, such as the production of floral structures, induction of disease resistance, and adaptation to stress. Additionally, recent whole-genome duplications that have occurred in the lineages of several domesticated crop species, including wheat (Triticum aestivum), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and soybean (Glycine max), have contributed to important agronomic traits, such as grain quality, fruit shape, and flowering time. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and impacts of gene duplication will be important to future studies of plants in general and of agronomically important crops in particular. In this review, we survey the current knowledge about gene duplication, including gene duplication mechanisms, the potential fates of duplicate genes, models explaining duplicate gene retention, the properties that distinguish duplicate from singleton genes, and the evolutionary impact of gene duplication."

evolution,"We introduce a simple evolution scheme for multiobjective optimization problems, called the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible nontrivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm, in its simplest form, is a (11) evolution strategy employing local search but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. (11)-PAES is intended to be a baseline approach against which more involved methods may be compared. It may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. We introduce (1) and () variants of PAES as extensions to the basic algorithm. Six variants of PAES are compared to variants of the Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm over a diverse suite of six test functions. Results are analyzed and presented using techniques that reduce the attainment surfaces generated from several optimization runs into a set of univariate distributions. This allows standard statistical analysis to be carried out for comparative purposes. Our results provide strong evidence that PAES performs consistently well on a range of multiobjective optimization tasks."
evolution,"In historical biogeography, model-based inference methods for reconstructing the evolution of geographic ranges on phylogenetic trees are poorly developed relative to the diversity of analogous methods available for inferring character evolution. We attempt to rectify this deficiency by constructing a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model for geographic range evolution that specifies instantaneous transition rates between discrete states (ranges) along phylogenetic branches and apply it to estimating likelihoods of ancestral states (range inheritance scenarios) at cladogenesis events. Unlike an earlier version of this approach, the present model allows for an analytical solution to probabilities of range transitions as a function of time, enabling free parameters in the model, rates of dispersal, and local extinction to be estimated by maximum likelihood. Simulation results indicate that accurate parameter estimates may be difficult to obtain in practice but also show that ancestral range inheritance scenarios nevertheless can be correctly recovered with high success if rates of range evolution are low relative to the rate of cladogenesis. We apply the DEC model to a previously published, exemplary case study of island biogeography involving Hawaiian endemic angiosperms in Psychotria (Rubiaceae), showing how the DEC model can be iteratively refined from inspecting inferences of range evolution and also how geological constraints involving times of island origin may be imposed on the likelihood function. The DEC model is sufficiently similar to character models that it might serve as a gateway through which many existing comparative methods for characters could be imported into the realm of historical biogeography; moreover, it might also inspire the conceptual expansion of character models toward inclusion of evolutionary change as directly coincident, either as cause or consequence, with cladogenesis events. The DEC model is thus an incremental advance that highlights considerable potential in the nascent field of model-based historical biogeographic inference."
evolution,"By this definition, culture has proven to be widespread in the animal kingdom. The social transmission system of Norway rats was dissected in a classic series of papers by BG Galef (1988) and his colleagues. Andrew Whiten (Whiten, McGuigan, Marshall-Pescini, & Hopper, 2009), Michael Tomasello (Herrmann, Call, Hernandez-Lloreda, Hare, & Tomasello, 2007) and their colleagues have studied social transmission in apes and humans in a comparative framework. This work shows that chimpanzees are rather good social learners compared to other animals, but humans prove to be much better social learners than our nearest relatives. Human children are compulsive imitators. The quantity of information that humans can acquire by social transmission thus far outpaces that of any other species. Humans can thus build up complex cultural adaptations by cumulating successive innovations to eventually evolve structures and behaviors that rival organic adaptations in their sophistication and diversity. For example, beginning about 11,000 years ago, foraging peoples who harvested wild plants began to experiment with simple schemes for encouraging the plants they targeted (Richerson, Boyd, & Bettinger, 2001). Over the subsequent few thousand years, such experiments eventually resulted in the creation of a diverse set of artificial agroecosystems based upon domesticated plants and animals. Systems adapted to most climates and soils on earth evolved, ranging from root crop dominated systems in the poor soils of tropical rain forests to caribou herding near the Arctic Circle. In favored areas, agriculture led to dense settled populations, intricately adapted agricultural technology, and complex social systems. Humans are the only species we know that is highly specialized for social learning and cultural adaptations. These skills led to a cultural adaptive radiation that bears comparison with the rapid radiations hundreds of new species of fishes in large tropical lakes."
evolution,"Resistance on a background of tolerance Bacteria survive antibiotic exposure either because they are quiescent when antibiotics are around in the highest concentrations (i.e., tolerance) or because they acquire active biochemical resistance mechanisms (i.e., resistance). Both tolerance and resistance involve the acquisition of mutations from the wild type. Levin-Reisman et al. used in vitro evolution experiments to show that populations of bacteria that become genetically resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin most quickly do so on a background of tolerance mutations (see the Perspective by Lewis and Shan). Because the probability of a tolerant organism surviving is higher, it has a greater chance of subsequently acquiring resistance mutations. Tolerance is often overlooked in the clinic but should in future be screened for and targeted more precisely to reduce the rates of acquired resistance. Science, this issue p. 826; see also p. 796 Tolerance to antibiotics is often overlooked in the clinic, but tolerance drives the rapid evolution of resistance. Controlled experimental evolution during antibiotic treatment can help to explain the processes leading to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Recently, intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is, the ability to survive under treatment without developing resistance. However, whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of resistance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded resistance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for resistance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of resistance. Preventing the evolution of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of resistance."
evolution,"Trends in electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are investigated on the basis of a large database of HO* and HOO* adsorption energies on oxide surfaces. The theoretical overpotential was calculated by applying standard density functional theory in combination with the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model. We showed that by the discovery of a universal scaling relation between the adsorption energies of HOO* vs HO*, it is possible to analyze the reaction free energy diagrams of all the oxides in a general way. This gave rise to an activity volcano that was the same for a wide variety of oxide catalyst materials and a universal descriptor for the oxygen evolution activity, which suggests a fundamental limitation on the maximum oxygen evolution activity of planar oxide catalysts."
evolution,"In this paper, we present a new variational formulation for geometric active contours that forces the level set function to be close to a signed distance function, and therefore completely eliminates the need of the costly re-initialization procedure. Our variational formulation consists of an internal energy term that penalizes the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function, and an external energy term that drives the motion of the zero level set toward the desired image features, such as object boundaries. The resulting evolution of the level set function is the gradient flow that minimizes the overall energy functional. The proposed variational level set formulation has three main advantages over the traditional level set formulations. First, a significantly larger time step can be used for numerically solving the evolution partial differential equation, and therefore speeds up the curve evolution. Second, the level set function can be initialized with general functions that are more efficient to construct and easier to use in practice than the widely used signed distance function. Third, the level set evolution in our formulation can be easily implemented by simple finite difference scheme and is computationally more efficient. The proposed algorithm has been applied to both simulated and real images with promising results."
evolution,"Joan Bybee and her colleagues present a new theory of the evolution of grammar that links structure and meaning in a way that directly challenges most contemporary versions of generative grammar. This study focuses on the use and meaning of grammatical markers of tense, aspect and modality and identifies a universal set of grammatical categories. The authors demonstrate that the semantic content of these categories evolves gradually and that this process of evolution is strikingly similar across unrelated languages. Through a survey of 76 languages in 25 different phyla, the authors show that the same paths of change occur universally and that movement along these paths is in one direction only. This analysis reveals that lexical substance evolves into grammatical substance through various mechanisms of change, such as metaphorical extension and the conventionalization of implicature. Grammaticization is always accompanied by an increase in frequency of the grammatical marker, providing clear evidence that language use is a major factor in the evolution of synchronic language states."
evolution,"Welcome to the city Human populations are shifting en masse to cities, which is leading to rapid increases in the number and extent of urban areas. Such changes are well known to cause declines in many species, but they can also act as alternative selection pressures to which some species are able to adapt. Johnson and Munshi-South review the suite of pressures that urban environments exert, the ways in which species may (or may not) adapt, and the larger impact of these evolutionary events on natural processes and human populations. Understanding such urban evolution patterns will improve our ability to foster species persistence in the face of urbanization and to mitigate some of the challenges, such as disease, that adaptation can bring. Science, this issue p. eaam8327 BACKGROUND The extent of urban areas is increasing around the world, and most humans now live in cities. Urbanization results in dramatic environmental change, including increased temperatures, more impervious surface cover, altered hydrology, and elevated pollution. Urban areas also host more non-native species and reduced abundance and diversity of many native species. These environmental changes brought by global urbanization are creating novel ecosystems with unknown consequences for the evolution of life. Here, we consider how early human settlements led to the evolution of human commensals, including some of the most notorious pests and disease vectors. We also comprehensively review how contemporary urbanization affects the evolution of species that coinhabit cities. ADVANCES A recent surge of research shows that urbanization affects both nonadaptive and adaptive evolution. Some of the clearest results of urban evolution show that cities elevate the strength of random genetic drift (stochastic changes in allele frequencies) and restrict gene flow (the movement of alleles between populations due to dispersal and mating). Populations of native species in cities often represent either relicts that predate urbanization or populations that established after a city formed. Both scenarios frequently result in a loss of genetic diversity within populations and increased differentiation between populations. Fragmentation and urban infrastructure also create barriers to dispersal, and consequently, gene flow is often reduced among city populations, which further contributes to genetic differentiation between populations. The influence of urbanization on mutation and adaptive evolution are less clear. A small number of studies suggest that industrial pollution can elevate mutation rates, but the pervasiveness of this effect is unknown. A better studied phenomenon are the effects of urbanization on evolution by natural selection. A growing number of studies show that plant and animal populations experience divergent selection between urban and nonurban environments. This divergent selection has led to adaptive evolution in life history, morphology, physiology, behavior, and reproductive traits. These adaptations typically evolve in response to pesticide use, pollution, local climate, or the physical structure of cities. Despite these important results, the genetic basis of adaptive evolution is known from only a few cases. Most studies also examine only a few populations in one city, and experimental validation is rare. OUTLOOK The study of evolution in urban areas provides insights into both fundamental and applied problems in biology. The thousands of cities throughout the world share some features while differing in other aspects related to their age, historical context, governmental policies, and local climate. Thus, the phenomenon of global urbanization represents an unintended but highly replicated global study of experimental evolution. We can harness this global urban experiment to understand the repeatability and pace of evolution in response to human activity. Among the most important unresolved questions is, how often do native and exotic species adapt to the particular environmental challenges found in cities? Such adaptations could be the difference as to whether a species persists or vanishes from urban areas. In this way, the study of urban evolution can help us understand how evolution in populations may contribute to conservation of rare species, and how populations can be managed to facilitate the establishment of resilient and sustainable urban ecosystems. In a similar way, understanding evolution in urban areas can lead to improved human health. For example, human pests frequently adapt to pesticides and evade control efforts because of our limited understanding of the size of populations and movement of individuals. Applied evolutionary studies could lead to more effective mitigation of pests and disease agents. The study of urban evolution has rapidly become an important frontier in biology, with implications for healthy and sustainable human populations in urban ecosystems. A gradient in urbanization showing the skyline of Canada’s sixth largest city (Mississauga, Canada) on the horizon, and the Credit Valley and the University of Toronto Mississauga campus in the foreground. PHOTO CREDIT: ARJUN YADAV Our planet is an increasingly urbanized landscape, with over half of the human population residing in cities. Despite advances in urban ecology, we do not adequately understand how urbanization affects the evolution of organisms, nor how this evolution may affect ecosystems and human health. Here, we review evidence for the effects of urbanization on the evolution of microbes, plants, and animals that inhabit cities. Urbanization affects adaptive and nonadaptive evolutionary processes that shape the genetic diversity within and between populations. Rapid adaptation has facilitated the success of some native species in urban areas, but it has also allowed human pests and disease to spread more rapidly. The nascent field of urban evolution brings together efforts to understand evolution in response to environmental change while developing new hypotheses concerning adaptation to urban infrastructure and human socioeconomic activity. The next generation of research on urban evolution will provide critical insight into the importance of evolution for sustainable interactions between humans and our city environments."

evolution,"Macroscopic thin liquid films are entities that are important in biophysics, physics, and engineering, as well as in natural settings. They can be composed of common liquids such as water or oil, rheologically complex materials such as polymers solutions or melts, or complex mixtures of phases or components. When the films are subjected to the action of various mechanical, thermal, or structural factors, they display interesting dynamic phenomena such as wave propagation, wave steepening, and development of chaotic responses. Such films can display rupture phenomena creating holes, spreading of fronts, and the development of fingers. In this review a unified mathematical theory is presented that takes advantage of the disparity of the length scales and is based on the asymptotic procedure of reduction of the full set of governing equations and boundary conditions to a simplified, highly nonlinear, evolution equation or to a set of equations. As a result of this long-wave theory, a mathematical system is obtained that does not have the mathematical complexity of the original free-boundary problem but does preserve many of the important features of its physics. The basics of the long-wave theory are explained. If, in addition, the Reynolds number of the flow is notmore » too large, the analogy with Reynolds{close_quote}s theory of lubrication can be drawn. A general nonlinear evolution equation or equations are then derived and various particular cases are considered. Each case contains a discussion of the linear stability properties of the base-state solutions and of the nonlinear spatiotemporal evolution of the interface (and other scalar variables, such as temperature or solute concentration). The cases reducing to a single highly nonlinear evolution equation are first examined. (Abstract Truncated)« less"

evolution,"In recent years, economic geographers have seized on the concepts of ‘path dependence’ and ‘lock-in’ as key ingredients in constructing an evolutionary approach to their subject. However, they have tended in to invoke these notions without a proper examination of the ongoing discussion and debate devoted to them within evolutionary economics and elsewhere. Our aim in this paper, therefore, is, first, to highlight some of the unresolved issues surround these concepts, and, second, to explore their usefulness for understanding the regional economic evolution. We argue that in many important aspects, path dependence and lock-in are place-dependent processes, and as such require geographical explanation. At the same time, there has been little discussion of regional path creation: te assumption has been that new technological-economic paths emerge at random or spontaneously across space, an assumption that we find too simplistic. This leads on to the key question as to why some regional economies become locked into development paths that lose dynamism, whilst other regional economies seem able to avoid this danger and in effect are able ‘reinvent’ themselves through successive new paths or phases of development. We conclude that whilst path dependence is an important feature of the economic landscape, the concept requires further elaboration if it is to function as a core concept in an evolutionary economic geography."
evolution,"Rates of molecular evolution vary widely between lineages, but quantification of how rates change has proven difficult. Recently proposed estimation procedures have mainly adopted highly parametric approaches that model rate evolution explicitly. In this study, a semiparametric smoothing method is developed using penalized likelihood. A saturated model in which every lineage has a separate rate is combined with a roughness penalty that discourages rates from varying too much across a phylogeny. A data-driven cross-validation criterion is then used to determine an optimal level of smoothing. This criterion is based on an estimate of the average prediction error associated with pruning lineages from the tree. The methods are applied to three data sets of six genes across a sample of land plants. Optimally smoothed estimates of absolute rates entailed 2- to 10-fold variation across lineages."

The development of new electrocatalysts to make renewable and clean fuels from abundant and easily accessible resources is among the most challenging and demanding tasks for today's scientists and engineers.

evolution,"A number of scholars have found that concepts such as mutation, selection, and random drift, which emerged from the theory of biological evolution, may also explain evolutionary phenomena in other disciplines as well. Drawing on these concepts, Professors Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman classify and systematize the various modes of transmitting ""culture"" and explore their consequences for cultural evolution. In the process, they develop a mathematical theory of the non-genetic transmission of cultural traits that provides a framework for future investigations in quantitative social and anthropological science. The authors use quantitative models that incorporate the various modes of transmission (for example, parent-child, peer-peer, and teacher-student), and evaluate data from sociology, archaeology, and epidemiology in terms of the models. They show that the various modes of transmission in conjunction with cultural and natural selection produce various rates of cultural evolution and various degrees of diversity within and between groups. The same framework can be used for explaining phenomena as apparently unrelated as linguistics, epidemics, social values and customs, and diffusion of innovations. The authors conclude that cultural transmission is an essential factor in the study of cultural change."

evolution,"■ Abstract The phase-field method has recently emerged as a powerful computational approach to modeling and predicting mesoscale morphological and microstructure evolution in materials. It describes a microstructure using a set of conserved and nonconserved field variables that are continuous across the interfacial regions. The temporal and spatial evolution of the field variables is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard nonlinear diffusion equation and the Allen-Cahn relaxation equation. With the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic information as the input, the phase-field method is able to predict the evolution of arbitrary morphologies and complex microstructures without explicitly tracking the positions of interfaces. This paper briefly reviews the recent advances in developing phase-field models for various materials processes including solidification, solid-state structural phase transformations, grain growth and coarsening, domain evolution in thin films, pattern formation on surfaces, dislocation microstructures, crack propagation, and electromigration."

The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (mAB ≃ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 (mAB ≃ 23), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 (mAB ≃ 25), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys (R = 100-200) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 < z < 2 and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. The GALEX mission includes a guest investigator program, supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first UV sky survey."
evolution,"Trade-offs represent the costs paid in the currency of fitness when a beneficial change in one trait is linked to a detrimental change in another. If there were no trade-offs, then selection would drive all traits correlated with fitness to limits imposed by history and design. However, we find that many life-history traits are maintained well within those limits. Therefore, trade-offs must exist. Trade-offs have played a central role in the development of life-history theory, from Gadgil & Bossert (1970), Charnov & Krebs (1973), Schaffer (1972, 1974a, b) and Bell (1980) on to the present. They have been measured through field observations (e.g. Clutton-Brock, Guinness & Albon, 1982, 1983), through experimental manipulations in laboratory (e.g. Partridge & Farquhar, 1981) and field (e.g. Askenmo, 1979), through -phenotypic correlations in the laboratory (e.g. Bell, 1984a, b) and through genetic correlations (e.g. Rose & Charlesworth, 1981a, b), to mention only a few of the more prominent studies. They have been reviewed by Stearns (1976, 1977), Bell (1980), Charlesworth (1980), Warner (1984), Reznick (1985), Partridge & Harvey (1985, 1988) and most thoroughly by Bell & Koufopanou (1986). In addition, the methods used to measure trade-offs have been the subject of criticism (Tuomi, Hakala & Haukioja, 1983; Partridge, 1987) and controversy (Reznick, Perry & Travis, 1986; Bell, 1986). The most prominent life-history trade-off involves the cost of reproduction. It has two major components, costs paid in survival and costs paid in future reproduction. Two approaches to analysing those costs were suggested by Williams: genetic costs represented by antagonistic pleiotropy (Williams, 1957) and phenotypic costs represented by negative correlations between current reproductive effort and future survival and reproduction (Williams, 1966a, b). A third, physiological approach to trade-offs has been developed by Hirshfield & Tinkle (1974) and Calow (1979), among many others (cf. Townsend & Calow, 1981). In this extensive discussion, a few points have not always received the attention they deserve: (1) That trade-offs can be measured and analysed at the level of the genotype, the phenotype and what lies between (intermediate structure) is well known and uncontroversial but it has not always been emphasized that each of those levels makes an essential contribution to our understanding. It is not a question of either genetic correlations or phenotypic correlations or physiological trade-offs but of how such measurements combine to deliver information about potential evolutionary responses. A study conducted at just one of these levels is likely to be of as little use as the information on the nature of the elephant delivered by one blind man holding its tail. (2) One can draw a useful distinction between intraindividual trade-offs for example, between the reproductive effort made by a female in one season and the probability that she will survive to the next season and intergenerational trade-offs for example, between a female's reproductive effort and the probability that her offspring will survive to the next season. Intraindividual tradeoffs (and only some of them) have received most attention but intergenerational trade-offs, which are arguably just as important, have been relatively ignored. They deserve more attention. (3) The genetic structure of a population, in particular the genetic variance-covariance matrix for a set of important life-history traits, reflects the very recent past, describes the present and predicts the near-term future. There is no logical or direct way to use the current genetic structure of a population to infer the trade-offs that constrained the past approach to the current state even if they occurred as recently as a few tens of generations ago (J. Travis, personal communication). (4) Our understanding of a trade-off can be described as first order (slope known), second order (curvature known) or third order (all details, including interaction effects, known). In a few cases we have reliable information about firstorder effects. In no case known to me do we have reliable information on second-order effects, which are important in the theory (e.g. Schaffer, 1974a). Measurement of third-order effects, however desirable (Pease & Bull, 1988), remains a matter for future research."
evolution,"Changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification of some animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. While the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. Here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. We present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4% of speciation events in flowering plants and 7% in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. Theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. The evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive."
evolution,"Nitrogen's Past and Future Microorganisms have been controlling Earth's nitrogen cycle since life originated. With life evolving around it, nitrogen became both an essential nutrient and a major regulator of climate. Canfield et al. (p. 192) review the major changes in the nitrogen cycle throughout Earth's history. Most of the time, perturbations typically coincided with the evolution of new metabolic pathways in various Bacteria or Archaea. The last century, however, has seen humans push the biological nitrogen cycle into a new stage altogether. The addition of large quantities of fixed nitrogen to crops in the form of fertilizer chokes out aquatic life that relies on runoff and adds significant amounts of N2O—a potent greenhouse gas—to the atmosphere. Although microorganisms may one day restore balance to the nitrogen cycle that they helped shape for billions of years, humans must modify their behavior or risk causing irreversible changes to life on Earth. Atmospheric reactions and slow geological processes controlled Earth’s earliest nitrogen cycle, and by ~2.7 billion years ago, a linked suite of microbial processes evolved to form the modern nitrogen cycle with robust natural feedbacks and controls. Over the past century, however, the development of new agricultural practices to satisfy a growing global demand for food has drastically disrupted the nitrogen cycle. This has led to extensive eutrophication of fresh waters and coastal zones as well as increased inventories of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Microbial processes will ultimately restore balance to the nitrogen cycle, but the damage done by humans to the nitrogen economy of the planet will persist for decades, possibly centuries, if active intervention and careful management strategies are not initiated."

evolution,"Since the Hipparcos mission and recent large scale surveys in the optical and the near-infrared, new constraints have been obtained on the structure and evolution history of the Milky Way. The population synthesis approach is a useful tool to interpret such data sets and to test scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. We present here new constraints on evolution parameters obtained from the Besancon model of population synthesis and analysis of optical and near-infrared star counts. The Galactic potential is computed self-consistently, in agreement with Hipparcos results and the observed rotation curve. Constraints are posed on the outer bulge structure, the warped and flared disc, the thick disc and the spheroid populations. The model is tuned to produce reliable predictions in the visible and the near-infrared in wide photometric bands from U to K. Finally, we describe applications such as photometric and astrometric simulations and a new classification tool based on a Bayesian probability estimator, which could be used in the framework of Virtual Observatories. As examples, samples of simulated star counts at different wavelengths and directions are also given."
evolution,"Our understanding of parental care behavior can be significantly advanced through the application of Williams’s Principle, which states that reproduction has not only a benefit but also a cost to lifetime fitness. My laboratory has formalized Williams’s Principle into the relative value theorem and found that its application to fishes, the taxa with the most diverse patterns of parental care, can help to explain which sex provides care and how much. In fishes, it is often the male that provides parental care, not because the male obtains greater benefits from this care, but probably because he pays fewer costs. Fish dynamically adjust their investment into parental care according to the number of offspring in their brood, past investment, genetic relatedness, and alternative mating opportunities, all of which affect the value of current offspring relative to potential future offspring. These results may also help us understand the joy and the challenges of parental care in humans."
evolution,"▪ Abstract Niche conservatism is the tendency of species to retain ancestral ecological characteristics. In the recent literature, a debate has emerged as to whether niches are conserved. We suggest that simply testing whether niches are conserved is not by itself particularly helpful or interesting and that a more useful focus is on the patterns that niche conservatism may (or may not) create. We focus specifically on how niche conservatism in climatic tolerances may limit geographic range expansion and how this one type of niche conservatism may be important in (a) allopatric speciation, (b) historical biogeography, (c) patterns of species richness, (d) community structure, (e) the spread of invasive, human-introduced species, (f) responses of species to global climate change, and (g) human history, from 13,000 years ago to the present. We describe how these effects of niche conservatism can be examined with new tools for ecological niche modeling."

evolution,"Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences have been aligned and compared in a number of living organisms, and this approach has provided a wealth of information about phylogenetic relationships. Studies of rDNA sequences have been used to infer phylogenetic history across a very broad spectrum, from studies among the basal lineages of life to relationships among closely related species and populations. The reasons for the systematic versatility of rDNA include the numerous rates of evolution among different regions of rDNA (both among and within genes), the presence of many copies of most rDNA sequences per genome, and the pattern of concerted evolution that occurs among repeated copies. These features facilitate the analysis of rDNA by direct RNA sequencing, DNA sequencing (either by cloning or amplification), and restriction enzyme methodologies. Constraints imposed by secondary structure of rRNA and concerted evolution need to be considered in phylogenetic analyses, but these constraint do not appear to impede seriously the usefulness of rDNA. An analysis of aligned sequences of the four nuclear and two mitochondrial rRNA genes identified regions of these genes that are likely to be useful to address phylogenetic problems over a wide range of levels of divergence. In general, the small subunit nuclear sequences appear to be best for elucidating Precambrian divergences, the large subunit nuclear sequences for Paleozoic and Mesozoic divergences, and the organellar sequences of both subunits for Cenozoic divergences. Primer sequences were designed for use in amplifying the entire nuclear rDNA array in 15 sections by use of the polymerase chaim reaction; these ""universal"" primers complement previously described primers for the mitochondrial rRNA genes. Pair of primers can be selected in conjunction with the analysis of divergence of the rRNA genes to address systematic problems throughout the hierarchy of life."

evolution,"I present a new statistical method for analysing the relationship between two discrete characters that are measured across a group of hierarchically evolved species or populations. The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two characters. The method takes into account information on the lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an application to the Hominoidea."
evolution,"We report chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets with a very high concentration of metallic 1T phase using a solvent free intercalation method. After removing the excess of negative charges from the surface of the nanosheets, highly conducting 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward the evolution of hydrogen with a notably low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec. By partially oxidizing MoS2, we found that the activity of 2H MoS2 is significantly reduced after oxidation, consistent with edge oxidation. On the other hand, 1T MoS2 remains unaffected after oxidation, suggesting that edges of the nanosheets are not the main active sites. The importance of electrical conductivity of the two phases on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity has been further confirmed by using carbon nanotubes to increase the conductivity of 2H MoS2."
evolution,"The ever-expanding depth and quality of photometric and spectroscopic observations of stellar populations increase the need for theoretical models in regions of age-composition parameter space that are largely unexplored at present. Stellar evolution models that employ the most advanced physics and cover a wide range of compositions are needed to extract the most information from current observations of both resolved and unresolved stellar populations. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is a collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones that spans a range of [Fe/H] from –2.5 to +0.5, [α/Fe] from –0.2 to +0.8 (for [Fe/H] ⩽ 0) or +0.2 (for [Fe/H] > 0), and initial He mass fractions from Y = 0.245 to 0.40. Stellar evolution tracks were computed for masses between 0.1 and 4 M☉, allowing isochrones to be generated for ages as young as 250 Myr. For the range in masses where the core He flash occurs, separate He-burning tracks were computed starting from the zero age horizontal branch. The tracks and isochrones have been transformed to the observational plane in a variety of photometric systems including standard UBV(RI)C, Stromgren uvby, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, and HST ACS/WFC and WFPC2. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is accessible through a Web site at http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/~models/ where all tracks, isochrones, and additional files can be downloaded."
evolution,"I want in this article to trace the history of an idea. It is beginning to become clear that a range of problems in evolution theory can most appropriately be attacked by a modification of the theory of games, a branch of mathematics first formulated by Von Neumann and Morgenstern in 1944 for the analysis of human conflicts. The problems are diverse and include not only the behaviour of animals in contest situations but also some problems in the evolution of genetic mechanisms and in the evolution of ecosystems. It is not, however, sufficient to take over the theory as it has been developed in sociology and apply it to evolution. In sociology, and in economics, it is supposed that each contestant works out by reasoning the best strategy to adopt, assuming that his opponents are equally guided by reason. This leads to the concept of a ‘minimax’ strategy, in which a contestant behaves in such a way as to minimise his losses on the assumption that his opponent behaves so as to maximise them. Clearly, this would not be a valid approach to animal conflicts. A new concept has to be introduced, the concept of an ‘evolutionary stable strategy’."
evolution,"Simple repetitive DNA sequences are a widespread and abundant feature of genomic DNA. The following several features characterize such sequences: (1) they typically consist of a variety of repeated motifs of 1-10 bases--but may include much larger repeats as well; (2) larger repeat units often include shorter ones within them; (3) long polypyrimidine and poly-CA tracts are often found; and (4) tandem arrangements of closely related motifs are often found. We propose that slipped-strand mispairing events, in concert with unequal crossing-over, can readily account for all of these features. The frequent occurrence of long tandem repeats of particular motifs (polypyrimidine and poly-CA tracts) appears to result from nonrandom patterns of nucleotide substitution. We argue that the intrahelical process of slipped-strand mispairing is much more likely to be the major factor in the initial expansion of short repeated motifs and that, after initial expansion, simple tandem repeats may be predisposed to further expansion by unequal crossing-over or other interhelical events because of their propensity to mispair. Evidence is presented that single-base repeats (the shortest possible motifs) are represented by longer runs in mammalian introns than would be expected on a random basis, supporting the idea that SSM may be a ubiquitous force in the evolution of the eukaryotic genome. Simple repetitive sequences may therefore represent a natural ground state of DNA unselected for coding functions."
evolution,"The antigenic evolution of influenza A (H3N2) virus was quantified and visualized from its introduction into humans in 1968 to 2003. Although there was remarkable correspondence between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than genetic evolution, and genetic change sometimes had a disproportionately large antigenic effect. The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution."
evolution,"Parallel evolution across replicate populations has provided evolutionary biologists with iconic examples of adaptation. When multiple populations colonize seemingly similar habitats, they may evolve similar genes, traits, or functions. Yet, replicated evolution in nature or in the laboratory often yields inconsistent outcomes: Some replicate populations evolve along highly similar trajectories, whereas other replicate populations evolve to different extents or in distinct directions. To understand these heterogeneous outcomes, biologists are increasingly treating parallel evolution not as a binary phenomenon but rather as a quantitative continuum ranging from parallel to nonparallel. By measuring replicate populations’ positions along this (non)parallel continuum, we can test hypotheses about evolutionary and ecological factors that influence the extent of repeatable evolution. We review evidence regarding the manifestation of (non)parallel evolution in the laboratory, in natural populations, and in applied contexts such as cancer. We enumerate the many genetic, ecological, and evolutionary processes that contribute to variation in the extent of parallel evolution."

evolution,"Intraspecific predation, the process of both killing and eating an individual of the same species, is a significant and widespread process that until recently has not received the attention it merits. It is a major factor in the biology of many species and may influence population structure, life history, competition for mates and resources, and behavior. It is commonly observed among many animals: For this review I read over 900 papers describing such predation in about 1300 species. Laurel Fox's 1975 review of cannibalism (54) should be read for additional information. Here I attempt to present new or different data, references, and ideas. One of my purposes is to establish a theoretical framework for the organization and interpretation of the numerous observations of intraspecific predation.

If a series of measurements, physical, biological, anthropological, or economical, not of the same object, but of a group of objects of the same type or family, be made, and a curve be constructed by plotting up the number of times the measurements fall within a given small unit of range to the range, this curve may be termed a frequency curve. As a rule this frequency curve takes the well known form of the curve of errors, and such a curve may be termed a normal frequency curve. The latter curve is symmetrical about its maximum ordinate. Occasionally, however, frequency curves do not take the normal form, and are then generally, but not necessarily, asymmetrical."
evolution,"Estimates of inbreeding depression obtained from the literature were used to evaluate the association between inbreeding depression and the degree of self‐fertilization in natural plant populations. Theoretical models predict that the magnitude of inbreeding depression will decrease with inbreeding as deleterious recessive alleles are expressed and purged through selection. If selection acts differentially among life history stages and deleterious effects are uncorrelated among stages, then the timing of inbreeding depression may also evolve with inbreeding. Estimates of cumulative inbreeding depression and stage‐specific inbreeding depression (four stages: seed production of parent, germination, juvenile survival, and growth/reproduction) were compiled for 79 populations (using means of replicates, N = 62) comprising 54 species from 23 families of vascular plants. Where available, data on the mating system also were collected and used as a measure of inbreeding history. A significant negative correlation was found between cumulative inbreeding depression and the primary selfing rate for the combined sample of angiosperms (N = 35) and gymnosperms (N = 9); the correlation was significant for angiosperms but not gymnosperms examined separately. The average inbreeding depression in predominantly selfing species (δ = 0.23) was significantly less (43%) than that in predominantly outcrossing species (δ = 0.53). These results support the theoretical prediction that selfing reduces the magnitude of inbreeding depression. Most self‐fertilizing species expressed the majority of their inbreeding depression late in the life cycle, at the stage of growth/reproduction (14 of 18 species), whereas outcrossing species expressed much of their inbreeding depression either early, at seed production (17 of 40 species), or late (19 species). For species with four life stages examined, selfing and outcrossing species differed in the magnitude of inbreeding depression at the stage of seed production (selfing δ = 0.05, N = 11; outcrossing δ = 0.32, N = 31), germination (selfing δ = 0.02, outcrossing δ = 0.12), and survival to reproduction (selfing δ = 0.04, outcrossing δ = 0.15), but not at growth and reproduction (selfing δ = 0.21, outcrossing δ = 0.27); inbreeding depression in selfers relative to outcrossers increased from early to late life stages. These results support the hypothesis that most early acting inbreeding depression is due to recessive lethals and can be purged through inbreeding, whereas much of the late‐acting inbreeding depression is due to weakly deleterious mutations and is very difficult to purge, even under extreme inbreeding."
evolution,"Recently, increasingly more microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been found and characterized within protein-coding genes and their untranslated regions (UTRs). These data provide useful information to study possible SSR functions. Here, we review SSR distributions within expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and genes including protein-coding, 3'-UTRs and 5'-UTRs, and introns; and discuss the consequences of SSR repeat-number changes in those regions of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Strong evidence shows that SSRs are nonrandomly distributed across protein-coding regions, UTRs, and introns. Substantial data indicates that SSR expansions and/or contractions in protein-coding regions can lead to a gain or loss of gene function via frameshift mutation or expanded toxic mRNA. SSR variations in 5'-UTRs could regulate gene expression by affecting transcription and translation. The SSR expansions in the 3'-UTRs cause transcription slippage and produce expanded mRNA, which can be accumulated as nuclear foci, and which can disrupt splicing and, possibly, disrupt other cellular function. Intronic SSRs can affect gene transcription, mRNA splicing, or export to cytoplasm. Triplet SSRs located in the UTRs or intron can also induce heterochromatin-mediated-like gene silencing. All these effects caused by SSR expansions or contractions within genes can eventually lead to phenotypic changes. SSRs within genes evolve through mutational processes similar to those for SSRs located in other genomic regions including replication slippage, point mutation, and recombination. These mutational processes generate DNA changes that should be connected by DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Mutation that has escaped from the MMR system correction would become new alleles at the SSR loci, and then regulate and/or change gene products, and eventually lead to phenotype changes. Therefore, SSRs within genes should be subjected to stronger selective pressure than other genomic regions because of their functional importance. These SSRs may provide a molecular basis for fast adaptation to environmental changes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
evolution,RNA viruses show high mutation frequencies partly because of a lack of the proofreading enzymes that assure fidelity of DNA replication. This high mutation frequency is coupled with high rates of replication reflected in rates of RNA genome evolution which can be more than a millionfold greater than the rates of the DNA chromosome evolution of their hosts. There are some disease implications for the DNA-based biosphere of this rapidly evolving RNA biosphere.
evolution,"Abstract An important tenet of evolutionary developmental biology (“evo devo”) is that adaptive mutations affecting morphology are more likely to occur in the cis-regulatory regions than in the protein-coding regions of genes. This argument rests on two claims: (1) the modular nature of cis-regulatory elements largely frees them from deleterious pleiotropic effects, and (2) a growing body of empirical evidence appears to support the predominant role of gene regulatory change in adaptation, especially morphological adaptation. Here we discuss and critique these assertions. We first show that there is no theoretical or empirical basis for the evo devo contention that adaptations involving morphology evolve by genetic mechanisms different from those involving physiology and other traits. In addition, some forms of protein evolution can avoid the negative consequences of pleiotropy, most notably via gene duplication. In light of evo devo claims, we then examine the substantial data on the genetic basis of adaptation from both genome-wide surveys and single-locus studies. Genomic studies lend little support to the cis-regulatory theory: many of these have detected adaptation in protein-coding regions, including transcription factors, whereas few have examined regulatory regions. Turning to single-locus studies, we note that the most widely cited examples of adaptive cis-regulatory mutations focus on trait loss rather than gain, and none have yet pinpointed an evolved regulatory site. In contrast, there are many studies that have both identified structural mutations and functionally verified their contribution to adaptation and speciation. Neither the theoretical arguments nor the data from nature, then, support the claim for a predominance of cis-regulatory mutations in evolution. Although this claim may be true, it is at best premature. Adaptation and speciation probably proceed through a combination of cis-regulatory and structural mutations, with a substantial contribution of the latter."
evolution,"Insecticides derived from the common soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are becoming increasingly important for pest management. Insecticidal crystal proteins (also called 8-endotoxins) from Bt are extremely toxic to certain pests, yet cause little or no hann to humans, most beneficial insects, and other nontarget organisms (19, 40). After proteolytic activation in the insect midgut, Bt toxins bind to the brush border membrane of the midgut epithelium and create pores that cause cells to swell and lyse (55). Technical innovations, including expression of Bt toxin genes in transgenic crop plants and transgenic bacteria, should increase the usefulness of Bt (6, 12, 35, 46, 91, 94, 109, 116). At the same time, mounting concerns about environmental hazards and widespread resistance in pest populations are reducing the value of conventional synthetic insecticides. Because Bt had been used commercially for more than two decades without reports of substantial resistance development in open field popu­ lations, some scientists had presumed that evolution of resistance was unlikely (21, 89). However, resistance to Bt was documented recently in field populations of diamondback moth in Hawaii, the continental US, and Asia (36, 42, 92a, 128, 129, 131, 138, 146, 148, 151). These reports confirmed suspicions raised by the results of laboratory selection for resistance to Bt in several major pests (102, 104, 135). Scientists in industry, government, and academia now recognize evolution of resistance to Bt in pests as the greatest threat to the continued success of Bt (18, 44, 58, 59, lOla, 108). To delay or reverse resistance to Bt in pests, we must first understand"
evolution,"Long distance migration has evolved in many organisms moving through different media and using various modes of locomotion and transport. Migration continues to evolve or become suppressed as shown by ongoing dynamic and rapid changes of migration patterns. This great evolutionary flexibility may seem surprising for such a complex attribute as migration. Even if migration in most cases has evolved basically as a strategy to maximise fitness in a seasonal environment, its occurrence and extent depend on a multitude of factors. We give a brief overview of different factors (e.g. physical, geographical, historical, ecological) likely to facilitate and/or constrain the evolution of long distance migration and discuss how they are likely to affect migration. The basic driving forces for migration are ecological and biogeographic factors like seasonality, spatiotemporal distributions of resources, habitats, predation and competition. The benefit of increased resource availability will be balanced by costs associated with the migratory process in terms of time (incl. losses of prior occupancy advantages), energy and mortality (incl. increased exposure to parasites). Furthermore, migration requires genetic instructions (allowing substantial room for learning in some of the traits) about timing, duration and distance of migration as well as about behavioural and physiological adaptations (fuelling, organ flexibility, locomotion, use of environmental transport etc) and control of orientation and navigation. To what degree these costs and requirements put constraints on migration often depends on body size according to different scaling relationships. From this expos it is clear that research on migration warrants a multitude of techniques and approaches for a complete as possible understanding of a very complex evolutionary syndrome. In addition, we also present examples of migratory distances in a variety of taxons. In recent years new techniques, especially satellite radio telemetry, provide new information of unprecedented accuracy about journeys of individual animals, allowing re-evaluation of migration, locomotion and navigation theories.

We also show that selection accounts for very little of this evolution. Instead, we propose a simple theory based on financing constraint. A calibrated version of our model does a good job at explaining the evolution of the firm size distribution."
evolution,"For many years John Fleagle's text on the adaptation and evolution of primates and early hominoid fossils was the the text of choice for teachers and research workers alike. Now, as the only such work in print, this new edition brings this coverage up to date with the latest fossil finds and most current research. The book retains its grounding in the extant primate groups as the best way to understand the fossil trail and the evolution of these modern forms. But this coverage is now streamlined, making reference to the many new and excellent books on living primate ecology and adaptation - a field that has burgeoned since the first edition of Primate Adaptation and Evolution. By drawing out the key features of the extant families and referring to more detailed texts, Fleagle sets the scene and also creates space for a thorough updating of the exciting developments in primate palaeontology - and the reconstruction through early hominid species - of our own human origins. Illustrated with many of the classic pictures from earlier editions - and whole new suite of illustrations, revised evolutionary trees and tables - this book remains the indispensible text on this fascinating subject. * Long-awaited revision of the standard student text on primate evolution* Full coverage of newly discovered fossils and the latest taxonomy* Over 200 new illustrations and revised evolutionary trees"
evolution,"For several years the study of social behavior has been undergoing a revolution with far-reaching consequences for the social and biological sciences. Partly responsible are three recent changes in the attitudes of evolutionary biologists. First was grow­ ing acceptance of the evidence that the potency of natural selection is overwhelm­ ingly concentrated at levels no higher than that of the individual. Second was revival of the comparative method, especially as applied to behavior and life histories. Third was spread of the realization that not only are all aspects of structure and function of organisms to be understood solely as products of selection, but because of their peculiarly direct relationship to the forces of selection, behavior and life history phenomena, long neglected by the evolutionists, may be among the most predictable of all phenotypic attributes. These ideas have been appreciated by a few biologists for a long time, but they have only recently begun to characterize the science as a whole. Darwin's discussion of sterility between species as an incidental effect of evolutionary adaptation (41 , p . 260) and his refusal to deal with sex ratio selection (42, p . 399) suggest an awareness of the difficult problem of determining the levels at which selection is most powerful. Yet significant clarification of this basic issue did not really com­ mence until publication of Wynne-Edwards' massive volume (179) championing group selection and inadvertently exposing its unlikelihood. As late as 1958, Fisher felt constrained to add to the revised edition of his 1929 classic, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, the admonishment (53, p. 49) that his fundamental theorem and its associated considerations, already misused then by decades of population geneticists dealing (as they saw it) with the fitness of populations, refer strictly to ""the progressive modification of structure or function only in so far as variations in these are of advantage to the individual . . . [and afford] no correspond­ ing explanation for any properties of animals and plants . . . supposed to be of service to the species to which they belong."" Williams' critique (171) provided a significant turning point. Nevertheless, one has only to pick up any biological journal or attend any biological meeting to realize that this question has not yet been settled for all"
evolution,"Natural photosynthesis uses sunlight to drive the conversion of energy-poor molecules (H(2)O, CO(2)) to energy-rich ones (O(2), (CH(2)O)(n)). Scientists are working hard to develop efficient artificial photosynthetic systems toward the ""Holy Grail"" of solar-driven water splitting. High on the list of challenges is the discovery of molecules that efficiently catalyze the reduction of protons to H(2). In this Account, we report on one promising class of molecules: cobalt complexes with diglyoxime ligands (cobaloximes). Chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical methods all have been utilized to explore proton reduction catalysis by cobaloxime complexes. Reduction of a Co(II)-diglyoxime generates a Co(I) species that reacts with a proton source to produce a Co(III)-hydride. Then, in a homolytic pathway, two Co(III)-hydrides react in a bimolecular step to eliminate H(2). Alternatively, in a heterolytic pathway, protonation of the Co(III)-hydride produces H(2) and Co(III). A thermodynamic analysis of H(2) evolution pathways sheds new light on the barriers and driving forces of the elementary reaction steps involved in proton reduction by Co(I)-diglyoximes. In combination with experimental results, this analysis shows that the barriers to H(2) evolution along the heterolytic pathway are, in most cases, substantially greater than those of the homolytic route. In particular, a formidable barrier is associated with Co(III)-diglyoxime formation along the heterolytic pathway. Our investigations of cobaloxime-catalyzed H(2) evolution, coupled with the thermodynamic preference for a homolytic route, suggest that the rate-limiting step is associated with formation of the hydride. An efficient water splitting device may require the tethering of catalysts to an electrode surface in a fashion that does not inhibit association of Co(III)-hydrides."
evolution,"Religion in Human Evolution is a work of extraordinary ambition--a wide-ranging, nuanced probing of our biological past to discover the kinds of lives that human beings have most often imagined were worth living. It offers what is frequently seen as a forbidden theory of the origin of religion that goes deep into evolution, especially but not exclusively cultural evolution. How did our early ancestors transcend the quotidian demands of everyday existence to embrace an alternative reality that called into question the very meaning of their daily struggle? Robert Bellah, one of the leading sociologists of our time, identifies a range of cultural capacities, such as communal dancing, storytelling, and theorizing, whose emergence made this religious development possible. Deploying the latest findings in biology, cognitive science, and evolutionary psychology, he traces the expansion of these cultural capacities from the Paleolithic to the Axial Age (roughly, the first millennium BCE), when individuals and groups in the Old World challenged the norms and beliefs of class societies ruled by kings and aristocracies. These religious prophets and renouncers never succeeded in founding their alternative utopias, but they left a heritage of criticism that would not be quenched. Bellah's treatment of the four great civilizations of the Axial Age--in ancient Israel, Greece, China, and India--shows all existing religions, both prophetic and mystic, to be rooted in the evolutionary story he tells. Religion in Human Evolution answers the call for a critical history of religion grounded in the full range of human constraints and possibilities."
evolution,"By classifying programs according to their relationship to the environment in which they are executed, the paper identifies the sources of evolutionary pressure on computer applications and programs and shows why this results in a process of never ending maintenance activity. The resultant life cycle processes are then briefly discussed. The paper then introduces laws of Program Evolution that have been formulated following quantitative studies of the evolution of a number of different systems. Finally an example is provided of the application of Evolution Dynamics models to program release planning."
evolution,"This classic work by Julian Huxley, first published in 1942, captured and synthesized all that was then known about evolutionary biology and gave a name to the Modern Synthesis, the conceptual structure underlying the field for most of the twentieth century. Many considered Huxley's book a popularization of the ideas then emerging in evolutionary biology, but in fact Evolution: The Modern Synthesis is a work of serious scholarship that is also accessible to the general educated public. It is a book in the intellectual tradition of Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley--Julian Huxley's grandfather, known for his energetic championing of Darwin's ideas. A contemporary reviewer called Evolution: The Modern Synthesis ""the outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps the century."" This definitive edition brings one of the most important and successful scientific books of the twentieth century back into print. It includes the entire text of the 1942 edition, Huxley's introduction to the 1963 second edition (which demonstrates his continuing command of the field), and the introduction to the 1974 third edition, written by nine experts (many of them Huxley's associates) from different areas of evolutionary biology."
evolution,"This paper presents natural evolution strategies (NES), a novel algorithm for performing real-valued dasiablack boxpsila function optimization: optimizing an unknown objective function where algorithm-selected function measurements constitute the only information accessible to the method. Natural evolution strategies search the fitness landscape using a multivariate normal distribution with a self-adapting mutation matrix to generate correlated mutations in promising regions. NES shares this property with covariance matrix adaption (CMA), an evolution strategy (ES) which has been shown to perform well on a variety of high-precision optimization tasks. The natural evolution strategies algorithm, however, is simpler, less ad-hoc and more principled. Self-adaptation of the mutation matrix is derived using a Monte Carlo estimate of the natural gradient towards better expected fitness. By following the natural gradient instead of the dasiavanillapsila gradient, we can ensure efficient update steps while preventing early convergence due to overly greedy updates, resulting in reduced sensitivity to local suboptima. We show NES has competitive performance with CMA on unimodal tasks, while outperforming it on several multimodal tasks that are rich in deceptive local optima."
evolution,"The theoretical literature on innovation has been concerned with a single innovation produced by a number of identical agents. By contrast, we consider a market in which one firm is the current incumbent, while the remaining firms are challengers. Moreover, we consider a sequence of innovations, so that success does not imply that the successful firm reaps monopoly profits forever after, but only until the next, better innovation is developed. We begin with a fully optimizing behavioral model and derive the equivalent of the Schumpeterian ""process of creative destruction."" That is, a firm enjoys temporary monopoly power but is soon overthrown by a more inventive challenger. The essential point to grasp is that in dealing with capitalism we are dealing with an evolutionary process…The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers' goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates [Schumpeter, 1942, pp. 82–83]."
evolution,"We describe a Bayesian method for investigating correlated evolution of discrete binary traits on phylogenetic trees. The method fits a continuous‐time Markov model to a pair of traits, seeking the best fitting models that describe their joint evolution on a phylogeny. We employ the methodology of reversible‐jump (RJ) Markov chain Monte Carlo to search among the large number of possible models, some of which conform to independent evolution of the two traits, others to correlated evolution. The RJ Markov chain visits these models in proportion to their posterior probabilities, thereby directly estimating the support for the hypothesis of correlated evolution. In addition, the RJ Markov chain simultaneously estimates the posterior distributions of the rate parameters of the model of trait evolution. These posterior distributions can be used to test among alternative evolutionary scenarios to explain the observed data. All results are integrated over a sample of phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. We implement the method in a program called RJ Discrete and illustrate it by analyzing the question of whether mating system and advertisement of estrus by females have coevolved in the Old World monkeys and great apes."
evolution,"The book treats cell evolution from the viewpoint of the serial endosymbiosis theory of the origin of organelles. Following a brief outline of the symbiotic theory, which holds that eukaryotes evolved by the association of free-living bacteria with a host prokaryote, the diversity of life is considered, and five kingdoms of organisms are distinguished: the prokaryotic Monera and the eukaryotic Protoctista, Animalia, Fungi and Plantae. Symbiotic and traditional direct filiation theories of cell evolution are compared. Recent observations of cell structure and biochemistry are reviewed in relation to early cell evolution, with attention given to the geological context for the origin of eukaryotic cells, the origin of major bacterial anaerobic pathways, the relationship between aerobic metabolism and atmospheric oxygen, criteria for distinguishing symbiotic organelles from those that originated by differentiation, and the major classes of eukaryotic organelles: mitochondria, cilia, microtubules, the mitotic and meiotic apparatuses, and pastids. Cell evolution during the Phanerozoic is also discussed with emphasis on the effects of life on the biosphere"
evolution,"The evolution and subsequent ecological expansion of grasses (Poaceae) since the Late Cretaceous have resulted in the establishment of one of Earth's dominant biomes, the temperate and tropical grasslands, at the expense of forests. In the past decades, several new approaches have been applied to the fossil record of grasses to elucidate the patterns and processes of this ecosystem transformation. The data indicate that the development of grassland ecosystems on most continents was a multistage process involving the Paleogene appearance of (C3 and C4) open-habitat grasses, the mid-late Cenozoic spread of C3 grass-dominated habitats, and, finally, the Late Neogene expansion of C4 grasses at tropical-subtropical latitudes. The evolution of herbivores adapted to grasslands did not necessarily coincide with the spread of open-habitat grasses. In addition, the timing of these evolutionary and ecological events varied between regions. Consequently, region-by-region investigations using both direct (plant fossil..."

evolution,"It once took two decades to replace one-third of the Fortune 500; now a subset of new firms are challenging and displacing this elite group at a breathtaking rate, while armies of startups come and go within just a few years. Most new jobs are, in fact, coming from small firms, reversing the trend of a century. David Audretsch takes a close look at the U.S. economy in motion, providing a detailed and systematic investigation of the dynamic process by which industries and firms enter into markets, either grow and survive, or disappear. He shapes a clear understanding of the role that small, entrepreneurial firms play in this evolutionary process and in the asymmetric size distribution of firms in the typical industry. Audretsch introduces the large longitudinal database maintained by the U.S. Small Business Administration that is used to identify the startup of new firms and track their performance over time. He then provides different snapshots of the process of industries in motion: why new-firm startup activity varies so greatly across industries; what happens to these firms after they enter the market; the extent to which entrepreneurial firms account for an industry's economic activity and why that measure varies across industries; how small firms compensate for size-related disadvantages; and who exits and why. Audretsch concludes that the structure of industries is characterized by a high degree of fluidity and turbulence, even as the patterns of evolution vary considerably from industry to industry. The dynamic process by which firms and industries evolve over time is shaped by three fundamental factors: technology, scale economies, and demand. Most important, the evidence suggests that it is the differences in the knowledge conditions and technology underlying each specific industry -- key elements in innovation -- that are responsible for the pattern particular to that industry."
evolution,"Developmental constraints (defined as biases on the production of variant phenotypes or limitations on phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system) undoubtedly play a significant role in evolution. Yet there is little agreement on their importance as compared with selection, drift, and other such factors in shaping evolutionary history. This review distinguishes between ""universal"" and ""local"" constraints; it deals primarily with the latter, which apply to a limited range of taxa. Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints. None of the latter (use of a priori adaptive predictions, direct measurement of selection, direct measurement of heritable variation, and use of the comparative method) is foolproof. In the final section, three larger issues regarding the role of developmental constraints in evolution are discussed: the extent to which evolutionary stasis can be explained in developmental terms, the extend to which evolutionary trends and patterns might be a consequence of developmental constraints, and the extent to which various genetic and developmental mechanisms have evolved in virtue of the need of lineages to manifest evolutionary plasticity (or adaptability) if they are to survive. Although no definitive conclusions are reached on these larger issues, we bring recent advances in developmental biology, evolutionary theory, and (to a limited extent) molecular biology to bear on them."
evolution,"The Tibetan Plateau, between the Kunlun Shan and the Himalayas, consists of terranes accreted successively to Eurasia. The northernmost, the Songban Ganzi Terrane, was accreted to the Kunlun (Tarim-North China Terrane) along the Kunlun-Qinling Suture during the late Permian. The Qiangtang Terrane accreted to the Songban-Ganzi along the Jinsha Suture during the late Triassic or earliest Jurassic, the Lhasa Terrane to the Qiangtang along the Banggong Suture during the late Jurassic and, finally, Peninsular India to the Lhasa Terrane along the Zangbo Suture during the Middle Eocene. The Kunlun Shan, Qiangtang and Lhasa Terranes are all underlain by Precambrian continental crust at least a billion years old. The Qiangtang and Lhasa Terranes came from Gondwanaland. Substantial southward ophiolite obduction occurred across the Lhasa Terrane from the Banggong Suture in the late Jurassic and from the Zangbo Suture in the latest Cretaceous-earliest Palaeocene. Palaeomagnetic data suggest successive wide Palaeotethyan oceans during the late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic and a Neotethys which was at least 6000 km wide during the mid-Cretaceous. Thickening of the Tibetan crust to almost double the normal thickness occurred by northward-migrating north-south shortening and vertical stretching during the mid-Eocene to earliest Miocene indentation of Asia by India; Neogene strata are almost flat-lying and rest unconformably upon Palaeogene or older strata. Since the early Miocene, the northward motion of India has been accommodated principally by north south shortening both north and south of Tibet. From early Pliocene to the Present, the Tibetan Plateau has risen by about two kilometres and has suffered east-west extension. Little, if any, of the India Eurasia convergence has been accommodated by eastward lateral extrusion."
evolution,"Abstract To characterize the nature of El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in different regions of the Pacific have been used. An optimal characterization of both the distinct character and the evolution of each El Nino or La Nina event is suggested that requires at least two indices: (i) SST anomalies in the Nino-3.4 region (referred to as N3.4), and (ii) a new index termed here the Trans-Nino Index (TNI), which is given by the difference in normalized anomalies of SST between Nino-1+2 and Nino-4 regions. The first index can be thought of as the mean SST throughout the equatorial Pacific east of the date line and the second index is the gradient in SST across the same region. Consequently, they are approximately orthogonal. TNI leads N3.4 by 3 to 12 months prior to the climate shift in 1976/77 and also follows N3.4 but with opposite sign 3 to 12 months later. However, after 1976/77, the sign of the TNI leads and lags are reversed."

evolution,"This comprehensive volume reviews current understanding of the origin and evolution of elements, from stellar nucleosynthesis to the chemical evolution of the cosmos. With chapters by leading authorities in the field, it describes models of how the elements are produced by stars, the nuclear processes involved, and how the quantity of elements evolved in our Galaxy and distant galaxies. The observed chemical composition of stars in defferent locations within our Galaxy and nearby galaxies is discussed, as are the compositions of hot and cold gases, of dust grains found between stars and in meteorites, and of the integrated light from distant galaxies and quasars. This authoritative volume is a valuable resource for graduate students and professional research astronomers."
evolution,"Skin color is one of the most conspicuous ways in which humans vary and has been widely used to define human races. Here we present new evidence indicating that variations in skin color are adaptive, and are related to the regulation of ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetration in the integument and its direct and indirect effects on fitness. Using remotely sensed data on UV radiation levels, hypotheses concerning the distribution of the skin colors of indigenous peoples relative to UV levels were tested quantitatively in this study for the first time. The major results of this study are: (1) skin reflectance is strongly correlated with absolute latitude and UV radiation levels. The highest correlation between skin reflectance and UV levels was observed at 545 nm, near the absorption maximum for oxyhemoglobin, suggesting that the main role of melanin pigmentation in humans is regulation of the effects of UV radiation on the contents of cutaneous blood vessels located in the dermis. (2) Predicted skin reflectances deviated little from observed values. (3) In all populations for which skin reflectance data were available for males and females, females were found to be lighter skinned than males. (4) The clinal gradation of skin coloration observed among indigenous peoples is correlated with UV radiation levels and represents a compromise solution to the conflicting physiological requirements of photoprotection and vitamin D synthesis. The earliest members of the hominid lineage probably had a mostly unpigmented or lightly pigmented integument covered with dark black hair, similar to that of the modern chimpanzee. The evolution of a naked, darkly pigmented integument occurred early in the evolution of the genus Homo. A dark epidermis protected sweat glands from UV-induced injury, thus insuring the integrity of somatic thermoregulation. Of greater significance to individual reproductive success was that highly melanized skin protected against UV-induced photolysis of folate (Branda & Eaton, 1978, Science201, 625-626; Jablonski, 1992, Proc. Australas. Soc. Hum. Biol.5, 455-462, 1999, Med. Hypotheses52, 581-582), a metabolite essential for normal development of the embryonic neural tube (Bower & Stanley, 1989, The Medical Journal of Australia150, 613-619; Medical Research Council Vitamin Research Group, 1991, The Lancet338, 31-37) and spermatogenesis (Cosentino et al., 1990, Proc. Natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.87, 1431-1435; Mathur et al., 1977, Fertility Sterility28, 1356-1360).As hominids migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB-induced synthesis of previtamin D(3). The lighter color of female skin may be required to permit synthesis of the relatively higher amounts of vitamin D(3)necessary during pregnancy and lactation. Skin coloration in humans is adaptive and labile. Skin pigmentation levels have changed more than once in human evolution. Because of this, skin coloration is of no value in determining phylogenetic relationships among modern human groups."
evolution,"We describe early success in the evolution of binary black-hole spacetimes with a numerical code based on a generalization of harmonic coordinates. Indications are that with sufficient resolution this scheme is capable of evolving binary systems for enough time to extract information about the orbit, merger, and gravitational waves emitted during the event. As an example we show results from the evolution of a binary composed of two equal mass, nonspinning black holes, through a single plunge orbit, merger, and ringdown. The resultant black hole is estimated to be a Kerr black hole with angular momentum parameter a approximately 0.70. At present, lack of resolution far from the binary prevents an accurate estimate of the energy emitted, though a rough calculation suggests on the order of 5% of the initial rest mass of the system is radiated as gravitational waves during the final orbit and ringdown."
evolution,"George Gaylord Simpson said in his classic Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1) that paleontologists enjoy special advantages over geneticists on two evolutionary topics. One general topic, suggested by the word ""tempo,"" has to do with ""evolutionary rates. . ., their acceleration and deceleration, the conditions of exceptionally slow or rapid evolutions, and phenomena suggestive of inertia and momentum."" A group of related problems, implied by the word ""mode,"" involves ""the study of the way, manner, or pattern of evolution, a study in which tempo is a basic factor, but which embraces considerably more than tempo"" (pp. xvii-xviii). Simpson's book was self-consciously written in the wake of Theodosius Dobzhansky's Genetics and the Origin of Species (2). The title of Dobzhansky's book suggested its theme: the role of genetics in explaining ""the origin of species""-i.e., a synthesis of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and the maturing science of genetics. In the introduction to his book, Simpson averred that an essential part of his study was an ""attempted synthesis of paleontology and genetics,"" an effort that pervaded the whole book, but was particularly the subject of the first two chapters, which accounted for nearly half the book's pages. Darwin believed that evolutionary change occurs by natural selection of small individual differences appearing every generation within any species. Singly the changes effected by selection are small but, given enough time, great changes can take place. Two of Darwin's most dedicated supporters, Thomas Huxley and Francis Galton, argued instead that evolution occurs by selection of discontinuous variations, or sports; evolution proceeds rapidly by discrete leaps. According to Huxley, if natural selection operates only upon gradual differences among individuals, the gaps between existing species and in the paleontological record could not be explained. For Galton, evolution was not a smooth and uniform process, but proceeded by ""jerks,"" some of which imply considerable organic change. This controversy was continued in the latter part of the nineteenth century by the biometricians Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon, who believed, like Darwin, in the primary importance of common individual differences, and by the geneticist William Bateson, who maintained the primary importance of discontinuous variations. The rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900 provided what might have been common grounds to resolve the conflict. Instead, the dispute between biometricians and geneticists extended to continental Europe and to the United States. Bateson was the champion of the Mendelians, many of whom accepted the mutation theory proposed by De Vries, and denied that natural selection played a major role in evolution. The biometricians for their part argued that Mendelian characters were sports of little importance to the evolutionary process."
evolution,"The malignant potential of adenomas of the colon and rectum varies with size, histological type and grade of epithelial atypia. The adenomatous polyp is usually small and has a low malignant potential, whereas tumors with a villous structure are usually larger and have a much higher cancer rate. Severe atypia is more common in villous adenomas than in adenomatous polyps. Evidence is presented which suggests that most cancers of the colon and rectum have evolved through the polyp‐cancer sequence although the majority of adenomas do not become cancerous during a normal adult life span. The slow evolution of the polyp‐cancer sequence is stressed. The implications of the polyp‐cancer sequence for the design of cancer prevention programmes and the study of the aetiology of large bowel cancer are discussed."
evolution,"We report a new transformation, the LogDet, that is consistent for sequences with differing nucleotide composition and that have arisen under simple but asymmetric stochastic models of evolution. This transformation is required because existing methods tend to group sequences on the basis of their nucleotide composition, irrespective of their evolutionary history. This effect of differing nucleotide frequencies is illustrated by using a tree-selection criterion on a simple distance measure defined solely on the basis of base composition, independent of the actual sequences. The new LogDet transformation uses determinants of the observed divergence matrices and works because multiplication of determinants (real numbers) is commutative, whereas multiplication of matrices is not,except in special symmetric cases. The use of determinants thus allows more general models of evolution with a symmetric rates of nucleotide change. The transformation is illustrated on a theoretical data set (where existing methods select the wrong tree) and with three biological data sets: chloroplasts, birds/mammals (nuclear), and honeybees ( mitochondrial ) . The LogDet transformation reinforces the logical distinction between transformations on the data and tree-selection criteria. The overall conclusions from this study are that irregular A,C,G,T compositions are an important and possible general cause of patterns that can mislead tree-reconstruction methods, even when high bootstrap values are obtained. Consequently, many published studies may need to be reexamined."
evolution,"Charles Darwin changed the course of scientific thinking by showing how evolution accounts for the stunning diversity and biological complexity of life on earth. Recently, there has also been increased interest in the social sciences in how Darwinian theory can explain human culture. Covering a wide range of topics, including fads, public policy, the spread of religion, and herd behavior in markets, Alex Mesoudi shows that human culture is itself an evolutionary process that exhibits the key Darwinian mechanisms of variation, competition, and inheritance. This cross-disciplinary volume focuses on the ways cultural phenomena can be studied scientifically - from theoretical modeling to lab experiments, archaeological fieldwork to ethnographic studies - and shows how apparently disparate methods can complement one another to the mutual benefit of the various social science disciplines. Along the way, this book reveals how new insights arise from looking at culture from an evolutionary angle. ""Cultural Evolution"" provides a thought-provoking argument that Darwinian evolutionary theory can both unify different branches of inquiry and enhance understanding of human behavior."
evolution,"Large changes are taking place in yield-determining traits of commercially exploited fish, including traits such as size-at-age and age-at-maturation. The cause of these phenotypic changes is often not understood, and genetic change arising from the selective effects of fishing may be a contributory factor. Selection generated by fishing gear is strong in heavily exploited fish stocks, and the spatial location of fishing can also cause strong selection. The success of selective breeding in aquaculture indicates that significant amounts of genetic variation for production-related traits exist in fish populations. Fisheries managers should be alert to the evolutionary change caused by fishing, because such changes are likely to be hard to reverse and, if properly controlled, could bring about an evolutionary gain in yield."

evolution,"A model for the evolution of gynodioecy from the hermaphrodite or monoecious condition is described, taking into account the effects of partial selfing and inbreeding depression. It is shown that a mutant causing male-sterility can be selected even if the female plants have the same ovule output as the hermaphrodites, but that the conditions for this are very stringent: The product of the selfing rate and the inbreeding depression must exceed one-half. If the females have an increased ovule output, gynodioecy can evolve with lower values of the selfing and inbreeding depression parameters. Expressions for the equilibrium frequency of females and of the male-sterility gene in both the dominant and the recessive case are given. By a similar technique, conditions for the evolution of androdioecy are derived. In a selfing population, these conditions are much less easily satisfied than those for gynodioecy, though in a randomly mating population the conditions are similar: If ovule production is abolished, pollen production must be more than doubled, or vice versa. Since androdioecy is known to be a very rare condition, it seems likely that avoidance of selfing has played a role in the evolution of gynodioecy. Using the equilibria derived for gynodioecy, the conditions for the evolution of subdioecy or dioecy, by means of a partial or total female-sterility mutation, are studied. In contrast to the situation in a hermaphrodite population, a female-sterility gene can be selected in a gynodioecious population if it confers a moderate increase in pollen output; some increase in pollen output is essential. The fate of such a female-sterility gene also depends on its linkage with the male-sterility gene. If this is recessive, and the female-sterility gene is dominant and has an effect in the females as well as the hermaphrodite individuals, then the second mutation will usually be eliminated unless it occurs at a locus tightly linked to the first gene. In other cases there is no such ""linkage constraint,"" though in all situations there may be selection for tighter linkage between the loci; this will result in an initially subdioecious population becoming more fully dioecious. These results agree with some of the facts known about the evolution of dioecy in plants. First, since gynodioecy is more often controlled by a recessive than a dominant gene, male heterogamety should be commoner than female, as is observed. Second, subdioecy should be common, since full dioecy requires not only the correct phenotypic effects of the two genes but also complementary dominance relations and tight linkage; subdioecy is indeed known in many species. The equilibria reached by our model have only one type of female in appreciable frequency, whereas the polleniferous individuals may fall into several genotypic classes; it is often observed that in subdioecious species the males are more variable than the females, regardless of which is the heterogametic sex. Finally, the equilibria generated by our model agree closely with the results of genetical studies of those dioecious species with male-determining Y chromosomes that have been investigated, in which both male-and female-sterility factors have been found, showing complementary dominance relations and no crossing-over between the loci, so that just two gamete types exist. Such a situation can be explained by the operation of the linkage constraint, which ensures that only linked mutations become established and does not require that unlinked genes have been brought together. This is consistent with the fact that dioecious species often have the same chromosome numbers as their bisexual relatives."
evolution,"Biological networks have an inherent simplicity: they are modular with a design that can be separated into units that perform almost independently. Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such ""modularly varying goals"" lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems."
evolution,"We examine the dynamic formation and stochastic evolution of networks connecting individuals whose payoffs from an economic or social activity depends on the network structure in place. Over time, individuals form and sever links connecting themselves to other individuals based on the improvement the resulting network offers them relative to the current network. Such a process creates a sequence of networks that we call an 'improving path'. The changes made along an improving path make the individuals, who added or deleted the relevant link(s) at each date, better off. Such sequences of networks can cycle, and we study conditions on underlying allocation rules that characterize cycles. Building on an understanding of improving paths, we consider a stochastic evolutionary process where in addition to intended changes in the network there is a small probability of unintended changes or errors. Predictions can be made regarding the relative likelihood that the stochastic evolutionary process will lead to any given network at some time. The evolutionary process selects from among the statically stable networks and cycles. We show that in some cases, the evolutionary process selects inefficient networks even though eAEcient ones are statically stable. We apply these results to the matching literature to show that there are contexts in which the evolutionarily stable networks coincide with the core stable networks, and thus achieve eAEciency."
evolution,"Accumulating prokaryotic gene and genome sequences reveal that the exchange of genetic information through both homology-dependent recombination and horizontal (lateral) gene transfer (HGT) is far more important, in quantity and quality, than hitherto imagined. The traditional view, that prokaryotic evolution can be understood primarily in terms of clonal divergence and periodic selection, must be augmented to embrace gene exchange as a creative force, itself responsible for much of the pattern of similarities and differences we see between prokaryotic microbes. Rather than replacing periodic selection on genetic diversity, gene loss, and other chromosomal alterations as important players in adaptive evolution, gene exchange acts in concert with these processes to provide a rich explanatory paradigm-some of whose implications we explore here. In particular, we discuss (1) the role of recombination and HGT in giving phenotypic ""coherence"" to prokaryotic taxa at all levels of inclusiveness, (2) the implications of these processes for the reconstruction and meaning of ""phylogeny,"" and (3) new views of prokaryotic adaptation and diversification based on gene acquisition and exchange."
evolution,"We examine empirical evidence for religious prosociality, the hypothesis that religions facilitate costly behaviors that benefit other people. Although sociological surveys reveal an association between self-reports of religiosity and prosociality, experiments measuring religiosity and actual prosocial behavior suggest that this association emerges primarily in contexts where reputational concerns are heightened. Experimentally induced religious thoughts reduce rates of cheating and increase altruistic behavior among anonymous strangers. Experiments demonstrate an association between apparent profession of religious devotion and greater trust. Cross-cultural evidence suggests an association between the cultural presence of morally concerned deities and large group size in humans. We synthesize converging evidence from various fields for religious prosociality, address its specific boundary conditions, and point to unresolved questions and novel predictions."
evolution,"SUMMARY
Lignin, a phenolic polymer derived mainly from hydroxycinnamyl alcohols, is ubiquitously present in tracheophytes. The development of lignin biosynthesis has been considered to be one of the key factors that allowed land plants to flourish in terrestrial ecosystems. Lignin provides structural rigidity for tracheophytes to stand upright, and strengthens the cell wall of their water-conducting tracheary elements to withstand the negative pressure generated during transpiration. In this review, we discuss a number of aspects regarding the origin and evolution of lignin biosynthesis during land plant evolution, including the establishment of its monomer biosynthetic scaffold, potential precursors to the lignin polymer, as well as the emergence of the polymerization machinery and regulatory system. The accumulated knowledge on the topic, as summarized here, provides us with an evolutionary view on how this complex metabolic system emerged and developed."
evolution,"The temporal shape evolution of CdSe quantum confined nanorods (quantum rods) in nonaqueous solvents with organometallic precursors was studied quantitatively and systematically. The experimental results revealed three distinguishable stages in the shape evolution. At high monomer concentrations, nanocrystals grow exclusively along the c-axis of the wurtzite structure, making this axis the long axis of the rods. At intermediate concentrations, nanocrystals grow simultaneously in three dimensions. At low monomer concentrations, the aspect ratio decreases in a process controlled by intraparticle diffusion on the surface of the nanocrystals. This intraparticle ripening stage is different from normal Ostwald ripening, which occurs at lower monomer concentrations and is by monomer migration from small to larger ones. Addition of hexylphosphonic acid or tetradecylphosphonic acid, strong cadmium ligands, is important mainly because it enables the high monomer concentrations needed for the growth of quantum rods...."
evolution,"1 One may wonder, ...] how complex organisms evolve at all. They seem to have so many genes, so many multiple or pleiotropic eeects of any one gene, so many possibilities for lethal mutations in early development, and all sorts of problems due to their long development. Abstract: The problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely disconnected research traditions: evolutionary biology and evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination and selection is not universally eeective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess ""evolvability"", i.e. the ability of random variations to sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to be distinguished from variation, which are the actually realized diierences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological versatility , developmental dissociability, morphological integration, and many more. For evolutionary biology the representation problem has important implications: how is it that extant species acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to change in evolution? What are the selective forces, if any, that shape the genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two main routes: epistatic mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is modularity. By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic eeects among characters serving diierent functions, with pleiotropic eeects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex. Such a design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation of diierent functions. Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of a modular design. While our current knowledge is insuucient to assess the plausibil-ity of these models, they form the beginning of a framework for understanding the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map."
evolution,"Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator–prey interaction [Abrams, P. & Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. & Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr & Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change – less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution."

They are usually characterized by non-convex functionals and continuous spaces suitable for strategies based on Differential Evolution (DE). In such a framework, this paper is aimed at presenting an overview of Differential Evolution-based approaches used in electromagnetics, pointing out novelties and customizations with respect to other fields of application. Starting from a general description of the evolutionary mechanism of Differential Evolution, Differential Evolution-based techniques for electromagnetic optimization are presented. Some hints on the convergence properties and the sensitivity to control parameters are also given.

evolution,"We present a detailed study of network evolution by analyzing four large online social networks with full temporal information about node and edge arrivals. For the first time at such a large scale, we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks. Using a methodology based on the maximum-likelihood principle, we investigate a wide variety of network formation strategies, and show that edge locality plays a critical role in evolution of networks. Our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non-local preferential attachment.
 Based on our observations, we develop a complete model of network evolution, where nodes arrive at a prespecified rate and select their lifetimes. Each node then independently initiates edges according to a ""gap"" process, selecting a destination for each edge according to a simple triangle-closing model free of any parameters. We show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to a power law out-degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases. Finally, we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale."
evolution,"Abstract.The differential evolution algorithm is a floating-point encoded evolutionary algorithm for global optimization over continuous spaces. The algorithm has so far used empirically chosen values for its search parameters that are kept fixed through an optimization process. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new version of the Differential Evolution algorithm with adaptive control parameters – the fuzzy adaptive differential evolution algorithm, which uses fuzzy logic controllers to adapt the search parameters for the mutation operation and crossover operation. The control inputs incorporate the relative objective function values and individuals of the successive generations. The emphasis of this paper is analysis of the dynamics and behavior of the algorithm. Experimental results, provided by the proposed algorithm for a set of standard test functions, outperformed those of the standard differential evolution algorithm for optimization problems with higher dimensionality."
evolution,"Circumstellar dust exists around several hundred main sequence stars. For the youngest stars, that dust could be a remnant of the protoplanetary disk. Mostly it is inferred to be continuously replenished through collisions between planetesimals in belts analogous to the Solar System’s asteroid and Kuiper belts, or in collisions between growing protoplanets. The evolution of a star’s debris disk is indicative of the evolution of its planetesimal belts and may be influenced by planet formation processes, which can continue throughout the first gigayear as the planetary system settles to a stable configuration and planets form at large radii. Evidence for that evolution comes from infrared photometry of large numbers of debris disks, providing snapshots of the dust present at different evolutionary phases, as well as from images of debris disk structure. This review describes the theoretical framework within which debris disk evolution takes place and shows how that framework has been constrained by observations."
evolution,"The ascendancy of dinosaurs on land near the close of the Triassic now appears to have been as accidental and opportunistic as their demise and replacement by therian mammals at the end of the Cretaceous. The dinosaurian radiation, launched by 1-meter-long bipeds, was slower in tempo and more restricted in adaptive scope than that of therian mammals. A notable exception was the evolution of birds from small-bodied predatory dinosaurs, which involved a dramatic decrease in body size. Recurring phylogenetic trends among dinosaurs include, to the contrary, increase in body size. There is no evidence for co-evolution between predators and prey or between herbivores and flowering plants. As the major land masses drifted apart, dinosaurian biogeography was molded more by regional extinction and intercontinental dispersal than by the breakup sequence of Pangaea."
evolution,"We review the current status of three well–established models (direct benefits, indirect benefits and sensory drive) and one newcomer (antagonistic chase–away) of the evolution of mate choice and the biases that are expressed during choice. We highlight the differences and commonalities in the underlying genetics and evolutionary dynamics of these models. We then argue that progress in understanding the evolution of mate choice is currently hampered by spurious distinctions among models and a misguided tendency to test the processes underlying each model as mutually exclusive alternatives. Finally, we suggest potentially fruitful directions for future theoretical and empirical research."

The word stress, like success, failure, or happiness, means different things to different people and, except for a few specialized scientists, no one has really tried to define it although it has become part of our daily vocabulary. Is it effort, fatigue, pain, fear, the need for concentration, the humiliation of censure, loss of blood, or even an unexpected success that requires complete reformulation of one's life? The answer is yes and no. That is what makes the definition of stress so difficult. Every one of these conditions can produce stress, and yet none of them, can be singled out as being ""it"" since the word applies equally to all others as well."
evolution,"Humans are unique in their range of environments and in the nature and diversity of their behavioral adaptations. While a variety of local genetic adaptations exist within our species, it seems certain that the same basic genetic endowment produces arctic foraging, tropical horticulture, and desert pastoralism, a constellation that represents a greater range of subsistence behavior than the rest of the Primate Order combined. The behavioral adaptations that explain the immense success of our species are cultural in the sense that they are transmitted among individuals by social learning and have accumulated over generations. Understanding how and when such culturally evolved adaptations arise requires understanding of both the evolution of the psychological mechanisms that underlie human social learning and the evolutionary (population) dynamics of cultural systems."

evolution,"We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter-dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few per cent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a time-scale of a few times 107 yr. With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift, and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number density of quasars from z∼2 to z=0 is a result of the combination of three effects: (i) a decrease in the merging rate; (ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and (iii) an increase in the time-scale for gas accretion. The predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped Lyα systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes, quasars and starburst galaxies is inextricably linked to the hierarchical build-up of galaxies."
evolution,"▪ Abstract The current status of modeling the evolution and nucleosynthesis of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is reviewed. The principles of AGB evolution have been investigated in recent years leading to improved and refined models, for example with regard to hot-bottom burning or the third dredge-up. The postprocessing s-process model yields quantitative results that reproduce many observations. However, these and most other processes in AGB stars are intimately related to the physics of stellar mixing. Mixing in AGB stars is currently not well-enough understood for accurate yield predictions. Several constraints and methods are available to improve the models. Some regimes of AGB evolution have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. These include the super-AGB stars and AGB stars at extremely low or ultra low metallicity."
evolution,"Halminton (1) was apparently the first to appreciate that the synthesis of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of natural selection had profound implications for social theory. In particular, insofar as almost all social behavior is either selfish or altruistic (or has such effects), genetical reasoning suggests that an individual's social behavior should be adjusted to his or her degree of relatedness, r, to all individuals affected by the behavior. We call this theory kinship theory. The social insects provide a critical test of Hamilton's kinship theory. When such theory is combined with the sex ratio theory of Fisher (9), a body of consistent predictions emerges regarding the haplodiploid Hymenoptera. The evolution of female workers helping their mother reproduce is more likely in the Hymenoptera than in diploid groups, provided that such workers lay some of the male-producing eggs or bias the ratio of investment toward reproductive females. Once eusocial colonies appear, certain biases by sex in these colonies are expected to evolve. In general, but especially in eusocial ants, the ratio of investment should be biased in favor of females, and in it is expected to equilibrate at 1 : 3 (male to female). We present evidence from 20 species that the ratio of investment in monogynous ants is, indeed, about 1 : 3, and we subject this discovery to a series of tests. As expected, the slave-making ants produce a ratio of investment of 1 : 1, polygynoys ants produce many more males than expected on the basis of relative dry weight alone, solitary bees and wasps produce a ratio of investment near 1 : 1 (and no greater than 1 : 2), and the social bumblebees produce ratios of investment between 1 : 1 and 1 : 3. In addition, sex ratios in monogynous ants and in trapnested wasps are, as predicted by Fisher, inversely related to the relative cost in these species of producing a male instead of a female. Taken together, these data provide quantitative evidence in support of kinship theory, sex ratio theory, the assumption that the offspring is capable of acting counter to its parents' best interests, and the supposition that haplodiploidy has played a unique role in the evolution of the social insects. Finally, we outline a theory for the evolution of worker-queen conflict, a theory which explains the queen's advantage in competition over male-producing workers and the workers' advantage regarding the ratio of investment. The theory uses the asymmetries of haplodiploidy to explain how the evolved outcome of parent-offspring conflict in the social Hymenoptera is expected to be a function of certain social and life history parameters."
evolution,"We propose a conceptual model that maps the causal pathways relating biological evolution to cultural change. It builds on conventional evolutionary theory by placing emphasis on the capacity of organisms to modify sources of natural selection in their environment (niche construction) and by broadening the evolutionary dynamic to incorporate ontogenetic and cultural processes. In this model, phenotypes have a much more active role in evolution than generally conceived. This sheds light on hominid evolution, on the evolution of culture, and on altruism and cooperation. Culture amplifies the capacity of human beings to modify sources of natural selection in their environments to the point where that capacity raises some new questions about the processes of human adaptation."
evolution,"For a long time the study of evolution has been based on morphology; the long neck of a giraffe, the human brain, a bird’s wing, and so on. Morphological change in evolution is explained by Darwin’s theory of natural selection, but this theory is largely qualitative rather than quantitative. Population genetics started more than half a century ago as an attempt to understand evolutionary change quantitatively. Because evolution must take place in all individuals of a species, the change of gene frequency in the population has been analyzed. However, so long as the facts of evolution are based on morphological traits, evolutionary change is very difficult to connect with gene frequency change except in relatively few circumstances. The remarkable progress of molecular biology has made it possible to apply population genetics theory to real data. We now know that genetic information is stored in linear sequences of DNA which are stably transmitted from generation to generation, and we can compare the linear sequences of DNA and amino acids among species. It is also possible to compare secondary and tertiary structures of proteins and nucleic acids from various sources. Because of such progress, some aspects of traditional neo-Darwinism are beginning to need revision. The first step in such a revision is the neutral mutation-random drift hypothesis put forward by Kimura (47) in 1968. In the next year, King & Jukes (53a) published a similar idea, though from a more biochemical point of view than that of Kimura. This theory states that most evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused by random genetic drift of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutations rather than by natural selection. Because this theory was contrary to the neo-Darwinian view at that time, it provoked much controversy. A complete review of the theory is found"
evolution,"The evolutionary significance of sex chromosomes has generally been associated with their effect on sex determination (see Mittwoch, 1967; Ohno 1967, 1979 for review). Here I will evaluate the idea that sex chromosomes also play an important role in the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits. As a premise I will assume that sexual dimorphism results from natural selection that favors different phenotypic characteristics in the two sexes. For example, in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) horn size and shape are sexually dimorphic. The massive recurved horns of males are presumably an adaptive compromise between the need to blunt head-to-head collisions between fighting males and to act as weapons against predators. The smaller dagger-like horns of females are favored in this' sex since their sole function is defense against predators (Geist, 1971). Many less obvious characteristics are also likely to differ in their selective value between the sexes. In an extensive review of sexual dimorphism in mammals, Glucksmann (1981) suggested that traits such as growth rate, thermoregulation, metabolic rate, biorhythms, sensory modality, and a wide variety of other traits differ between the sexes in their optimal value. Characteristics that are selectively favored in one sex but selected against in the other will be referred to as ""sexually-antagonistic"" traits. Consider the evolution of a sexually dimorphic trait from a monomorphic state. For example, Geist (1971) used paleontological evidence and taxonomy to argue that the sexually dimorphic horns of bighorn sheep evolved from a sexually monomorphic ancestor. Because an exact record of this evolutionary change is unavailable, I will arbitrarily assume for the purpose of illustration that the size of female horns remained unchanged while the size of male horns increased. The evolution of sexual dimorphism in horn size could have proceeded in at least two ways: 1) The increase in frequency of genes that enhanced horn size in males but not in females, and 2) The increase in frequency of genes that enhanced horn size in both sexes followed by the evolution of modifier genes that restricted the expression of increased horn size to males. The first way will be referred to as the ""pleiotropy-mechanism."" It requires genetic variability that simultaneously produces the sexually-antagonistic trait (increased horn size) and is sex-limited in its expression. The second way will be referred to as the ""modifermechanism."" It requires genetic variability for both the sexually-antagonistic trait (increased horn size) and sex-limited expression of this trait. A similar classification was previously proposed by Turner (1978) for the evolution of sexlimited traits in butterflies. Most mutations that have been studied carefully in the laboratory have not been found to be completely sex-limited in their expression. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that most of the genetic variability available for the evolution of sexual dimorphism would be initially expressed in both sexes. This assumption may be unreasonable when considering the enhancement of an established sexually dimorphic trait since developmental canalization (Waddington, 1962) may facilitate sex-limited gene expression. However, during the initial evolution of sexual dimorphism from a monomorphic state, a feasible sequence of events would be the ""modifier-mechanism"" described above. In the following model I will suggest how the sex chromosomes can facilitate"

evolution,"The evolution of the seed represents a remarkable life-history transition for photosynthetic organisms. Here, we review the recent literature and historical understanding of how and why seeds evolved. Answering the 'how' question involves a detailed understanding of the developmental morphology and anatomy of seeds, as well as the genetic programs that determine seed size. We complement this with a special emphasis on the evolution of dormancy, the characteristic of seeds that allows for long 'distance' time travel. Answering the 'why' question involves proposed hypotheses of how natural selection has operated to favor the seed life-history phenomenon. The recent flurry of research describing the comparative biology of seeds is discussed. The review will be divided into sections dealing with: (1) the development and anatomy of seeds; (2) the endosperm; (3) dormancy; (4) early seed-like structures and the transition to seeds; and (5) the evolution of seed size (mass). In many cases, a special distinction is made between angiosperm and gymnosperm seeds. Finally, we make some recommendations for future research in seed biology."
evolution,"The serial endosymbiosis theory is a favored model for explaining the origin of mitochondria, a defining event in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. As usually described, this theory posits that mitochondria are the direct descendants of a bacterial endosymbiont that became established at an early stage in a nucleus-containing (but amitochondriate) host cell. Gene sequence data strongly support a monophyletic origin of the mitochondrion from a eubacterial ancestor shared with a subgroup of the alpha-Proteobacteria. However, recent studies of unicellular eukaryotes (protists), some of them little known, have provided insights that challenge the traditional serial endosymbiosis-based view of how the eukaryotic cell and its mitochondrion came to be. These data indicate that the mitochondrion arose in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this organelle originated at essentially the same time as the nuclear component of the eukaryotic cell rather than in a separate, subsequent event."

evolution,"Abstract.— Hybrid sterility and inviability often result from the accumulation of substitutions that, while functional on their normal genetic backgrounds, cause a loss of fitness when brought together in hybrids. Previous theory has shown that such Dobzhansky‐Muller incompatibilities should accumulate at least as fast as the square of the number of substitutions separating two species, the so‐called snowball effect. Here we explicitly describe the stochastic accumulation of these incompatibilities as a function of time. The accumulation of these incompatibilities involves three levels of stochasticity: (1) the number of substitutions separating two allopatric lineages at a given time; (2) the number of incompatibilities resulting from these substitutions; and (3) the fitness effects of individual incompatibilities. Previous analyses ignored the stochasticity of molecular evolution (level 1) as well as that due to the variable effects of incompatibilities (level 3). Here we approximate the full stochastic process characterizing the accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities between pairs of loci. We derive the distribution of the number of incompatibilities as a function of divergence time between allopatric taxa as well as the distribution of waiting times to speciation by postzygotic isolation. We provide simple approximations for the mean and variance of these waiting times. These results let us estimate, albeit crudely, the probability, p, that two diverged sites from different species will contribute to hybrid sterility or inviability. Our analyses of data from Drosophila and Bombina suggest that p is generally very small, on the order of 10−6 or less."
evolution,"Comparative analysis of molecular sequence data is essential for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of species and inferring the nature and extent of selective forces shaping the evolution of genes and species. Here, we announce the release of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 5 (MEGA5), which is a user-friendly software for mining online databases, building sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, and using methods of evolutionary bioinformatics in basic biology, biomedicine, and evolution. The newest addition in MEGA5 is a collection of maximum likelihood (ML) analyses for inferring evolutionary trees, selecting best-fit substitution models (nucleotide or amino acid), inferring ancestral states and sequences (along with probabilities), and estimating evolutionary rates site-by-site. In computer simulation analyses, ML tree inference algorithms in MEGA5 compared favorably with other software packages in terms of computational efficiency and the accuracy of the estimates of phylogenetic trees, substitution parameters, and rate variation among sites. The MEGA user interface has now been enhanced to be activity driven to make it easier for the use of both beginners and experienced scientists.

evolution,"Serial passage experiments are a form of experimental evolution that is frequently used in applied sciences; for example, in vaccine development. During these experiments, molecular and phenotypic evolution can be monitored in real time, providing insights into the causes and consequences of parasite evolution. Within-host competition generally drives an increase in a parasite's virulence in a new host, whereas the parasite becomes avirulent to its former host, indicating a trade-off between parasite fitnesses on different hosts. Understanding why parasite virulence seldom escalates similarly in natural populations could help us to manage virulence and deal with emerging diseases."
evolution,"An evolutionary perspective offers novel insights into some major obstacles to achieving happiness. Impediments include large discrepancies between modern and ancestral environments, the existence of evolved mechanisms ""designed"" to produce subjective distress, and the fact that evolution by selection has produced competitive mechanisms that function to benefit one person at the expense of others. On the positive side, people also possess evolved mechanisms that produce deep sources of happiness: those for mating bonds, deep friendship, close kinship, and cooperative coalitions. Understanding these psychological mechanisms--the selective processes that designed them, their evolved functions, and the contexts governing their activation--offers the best hope for holding some evolved mechanisms in check and selectively activating others to produce an overall increment in human happiness."

evolution,"To make a case for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity in biological evolution, complexity needs to be both rigorously defined and measurable. A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that, because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural ""Maxwell Demon,"" within a fixed environment, genomic complexity is forced to increase."
evolution,"Behavioral evolution can be influenced by constraints, for example, of phylogeny and performance. In this paper I describe a pattern in the evolution of birdsongs that may reflect a constraint on vocal performance. Trilled vocalizations from 34 species of songbirds (Passeriformes: Emberizidae) were analyzed. Two acoustic variables, trill rate and frequency bandwidth, were measured for different trill types. In most species, maximal values of frequency bandwidth were found to decrease with increasing trill rates. Further, trills with low trill rates exhibited wide variance in frequency bandwidth, and trills with high trill rates exhibited only narrow frequency bandwidths. The bounded nature of this pattern suggests that performance constraints have limited the evolutionary diversification of trills. In particular, I explore the role of constraints associated with vocal tract modulations during song production and evolution. Identification of this constraint may enhance our ability to explain particular patterns of trill evolution."
evolution,"Human skin pigmentation shows a strong positive correlation with ultraviolet radiation intensity, suggesting that variation in skin color is, at least partially, due to adaptation via natural selection. We investigated the evolution of pigmentation variation by testing for the presence of positive directional selection in 6 pigmentation genes using an empirical F(ST) approach, through an examination of global diversity patterns of these genes in the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)-Diversity Panel, and by exploring signatures of selection in data from the International HapMap project. Additionally, we demonstrated a role for MATP in determining normal skin pigmentation variation using admixture mapping methods. Taken together (with the results of previous admixture mapping studies), these results point to the importance of several genes in shaping the pigmentation phenotype and a complex evolutionary history involving strong selection. Polymorphisms in 2 genes, ASIP and OCA2, may play a shared role in shaping light and dark pigmentation across the globe, whereas SLC24A5, MATP, and TYR have a predominant role in the evolution of light skin in Europeans but not in East Asians. These findings support a case for the recent convergent evolution of a lighter pigmentation phenotype in Europeans and East Asians."

evolution,"So far in this course we have dealt entirely either with the evolution of characters that are controlled by simple Mendelian inheritance at a single locus or with the evolution of molecular sequences. Even last week when we were dealing with population genomic data, data from hundreds or thousands of loci, we were treating the variation at each locus separately and combining results across loci. I have some old notes on gametic disequilibrium and how allele frequencies change at two loci simultaneously, but they’re in the “Old notes, no longer updated” section of the book version of these notes (https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Lecture_notes_ in_population_genetics/100687), and we didn’t discuss them. In every example we’ve considered so far we’ve imagined that we could understand something about evolution by examining the evolution of a single gene. That’s the domain of classical population genetics. For the next few weeks we’re going to be exploring a field that’s older than classical population genetics, although the approach we’ll be taking to it involves the use of population genetic machinery. If you know a little about the history of evolutionary biology, you may know that after the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900 there was a heated debate between the “biometricians” (e.g., Galton and Pearson) and the “Mendelians” (e.g., de Vries, Correns, Bateson, and Morgan). Biometricians asserted that the really important variation in evolution didn’t follow Mendelian rules. Height, weight, skin color, and similar traits seemed to"
evolution,"Background We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree."
evolution,"Open-Source Software (OSS) development is regarded as a successful model of encouraging ""natural product evolution"". To understand how this ""natural product evolution"" happens, we have conducted a case study of four typical OSS projects. Unlike most previous studies on software evolution that focus on the evolution of the system per se, our study takes a broader perspective: It examines not only the evolution of OSS systems, but also the evolution of the associated OSS communities, as well as the relationship between the two types of evolution.Through the case study, we have found that while collaborative development within a community is the essential characteristic of OSS, different collaboration models exist, and that the difference in collaboration model results in different evolution patterns of OSS systems and communities. To treat such differences systematically, we propose to classify OSS into three types: Exploration-Oriented, Utility-Oriented, and Service-Oriented. Such a classification can provide guidance on the creation and maintenance of sustainable OSS development and communities."
evolution,"I here estimate the energy cost of changes in gene expression for several thousand genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A doubling of gene expression, as it occurs in a gene duplication event, is significantly selected against for all genes for which expression data is available. It carries a median selective disadvantage of s > 10(-5), several times greater than the selection coefficient s = 1.47 x 10(-7) below which genetic drift dominates a mutant's fate. When considered separately, increases in messenger RNA expression or protein expression by more than a factor 2 also have significant energy costs for most genes. This means that the evolution of transcription and translation rates is not an evolutionarily neutral process. They are under active selection opposing them. My estimates are based on genome-scale information of gene expression in the yeast S. cerevisiae as well as information on the energy cost of biosynthesizing amino acids and nucleotides."
evolution,"This paper has two complementary purposes: first, to present a method to perform multiple regression on distance matrices, with permutation testing appropriate for path‐length matrices representing evolutionary trees, and then, to apply this method to study the joint evolution of brain, behavior and other characteristics in marsupials. To understand the computation method, consider that the dependent matrix is unfolded as a vector y; similarly, consider X to be a table containing the independent matrices, also unfolded as vectors. A multiple regression is computed to express y as a function of X. The parameters of this regression (R2 and partial regression coefficients) are tested by permutations, as follows. When the dependent matrix variable y represents a simple distance or similarity matrix, permutations are performed in the same manner as the Mantel permutational test. When it is an ultrametric matrix representing a dendrogram, we use the double‐permutation method (Lapointe and Legendre 1990, 1991). When it is a path‐length matrix representing an additive tree (cladogram), we use the triple‐permutation method (Lapointe and Legendre 1992). The independent matrix variables in X are kept fixed with respect to one another during the permutations. Selection of predictors can be accomplished by forward selection, backward elimination, or a stepwise procedure. A phylogenetic tree, derived from marsupial brain morphology data (28 species), is compared to trees depicting the evolution of diet, sociability, locomotion, and habitat in these animals, as well as their taxonomy and geographical relationships. A model is derived in which brain evolution can be predicted from taxonomy, diet, sociability and locomotion (R2 = 0.75). A new tree, derived from the “predicted” data, shows a lot of similarity to the brain evolution tree. The meaning of the taxonomy, diet, sociability, and locomotion predictors are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the evolution of brain and behavior in marsupials."
evolution,"PAML, currently in version 4, is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA and protein sequences using maximum likelihood (ML). The programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses. Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (d(N) and d(S)) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. This note discusses some of the major applications of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their use. The package is written in ANSI C, and runs under Windows, Mac OSX, and UNIX systems. It is available at -- (http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html)."

evolution,"With its theoretical basis firmly established in molecular evolutionary and population genetics, the comparative DNA and protein sequence analysis plays a central role in reconstructing the evolutionary histories of species and multigene families, estimating rates of molecular evolution, and inferring the nature and extent of selective forces shaping the evolution of genes and genomes. The scope of these investigations has now expanded greatly owing to the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques and novel statistical and computational methods. These methods require easy-to-use computer programs. One such effort has been to produce Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software, with its focus on facilitating the exploration and analysis of the DNA and protein sequence variation from an evolutionary perspective. Currently in its third major release, MEGA3 contains facilities for automatic and manual sequence alignment, web-based mining of databases, inference of the phylogenetic trees, estimation of evolutionary distances and testing evolutionary hypotheses. This paper provides an overview of the statistical methods, computational tools, and visual exploration modules for data input and the results obtainable in MEGA."
evolution,"Recent developments of statistical methods in molecular phylogenetics are reviewed. It is shown that the mathematical foundations of these methods are not well established, but computer simulations and empirical data indicate that currently used methods such as neighbor joining, minimum evolution, likelihood, and parsimony methods produce reasonably good phylogenetic trees when a sufficiently large number of nucleotides or amino acids are used. However, when the rate of evolution varies exlensively from branch to branch, many methods may fail to recover the true topology. Solid statistical tests for examining'the accuracy of trees obtained by neighborjoining, minimum evolution, and least-squares method are available, but the methods for likelihood and parsimony trees are yet to be refined. Parsimony, likelihood, and distance methods can all be used for inferring amino acid sequences of the proteins of ancestral organisms that have become extinct."

The relationships between particle swarm optimization and both artificial life and genetic algorithms are described."
evolution,"Observations of star formation rates (SFRs) in galaxies provide vital clues to the physical nature of the Hubble sequence and are key probes of the evolutionary histories of galaxies. The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field. One of the most recognizable features of galaxies along the Hubble sequence is the wide range in young stellar content and star formation activity. This variation in stellar content is part of the basis of the Hubble classification itself (Hubble 1926), and understanding its physical nature and origins is fundamental to understanding galaxy evolution in its broader context. This review deals with the global star formation properties of galaxies, the systematics of those properties along the Hubble sequence, and their implications for galactic evolution. I interpret “Hubble sequence” in this context very loosely, to encompass not only morphological type but other properties such as gas content, mass, bar structure, and dynamical environment, which can strongly influence the largescale star formation rate (SFR)."

evolution,"Since 65 million years ago (Ma), Earth's climate has undergone a significant and complex evolution, the finer details of which are now coming to light through investigations of deep-sea sediment cores. This evolution includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic processes on time scales of 105to 107 years, rhythmic or periodic cycles driven by orbital processes with 104- to 106-year cyclicity, and rare rapid aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 103 to 105 years. Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate."
evolution,"Abstract We analyzed the rate at which postzygotic incompatibilities accumulate in birds. Our purposes were to assess the role of intrinsic F1 hybrid infertility and inviability in the speciation process, and to compare rates of loss of fertility and viability between the sexes. Among our sample more than half the crosses between species in the same genus produce fertile hybrids. Complete loss of F1 hybrid fertility takes on the order of millions of years. Loss of F1 hybrid viability occurs over longer timescales than fertility: some viable hybrids have been produced between taxa that appear to have been separated for more than 55 my. There is strong support for Haldane's rule, with very few examples where the male has lower fitness than the female. However, in contrast to Drosophila, fertility of the homogametic sex in the F1 appears to be lost before viability of the heterogametic sex in the F1. We conclude that the time span of loss of intrinsic hybrid fertility and viability is often, but not always, longer than the time to speciation. Premating isolation is an important mechanism maintaining reproductive isolation in birds. In addition, other factors causing postzygotic reproductive isolation such as ecological causes of hybrid unfitness, reduced mating success of hybrids, and genetic incompatibilities in the F2s and backcrosses may often be involved in the speciation process."
evolution,"Throughout the past, human beings have been concerned with how to acquire tools that might increase their potentialities, not only regarding the physical or intellectual aspect but also the metaphysical one. At the physical aspect, the use of wheels, levers, or cams, among others, finally reached the point of elaborating hominids and automats that in their most sophisticated creations consisted of animated statues that generally reproduced daily movements. Heron of Alexandria constructed some artificial actors which represented the Trojan War, where the idea of automats reached a high level of development as it was established that: (a) the mechanisms would act depending on the internal structure; (b) the action comes from an accurate organisation of motor forces, both natural and artificial; (c) the mobile ones are the most improved, since they are able to move completely. Ultimately, they are only the expression of the unavoidable human wish to increase their possibilities in all the aspects of their lives. In this line, some of the most remarkable creations include "" The Dove "" by Archytas de Tarente, Archimedes' "" Syracuse Defensive Mechanisms "" (developed to face the Roman fleet), "" The Mechanical Lion "" by Leonardo Da Vinci, the clock creations of the Droz brothers at the Cathedrals of Prague and Munich, and "" The Transverse Flute Player "" by Vaucanson. "" The Madzel Chess Automaton "" by Hungary's Von Kempelen was able to play chess with the best players of its time and impressed Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Edgar Allan Poe built a logical test trying to prove that this automaton was not authentic, but failed as he considered that the machine was not able to change its strategy as the game went on (Elgozy, 1985; Poe, 1894). At the metaphysical aspect, the creations along time also have been numerous. The main concern in this case was "" ex nihilo, "" the idea of a motionless-based creation of beings similar to humans that might act as substitutes to humans during the performance of the most tedious, dangerous, or unpleasant tasks. The Hephaistos (God of the Forge) androids were the first known reference to creation of artificial intelligence."
evolution,"Quantitative genetic models are used to investigate the evolution of generalists and specialists in a coarse‐grained environment with two habitat types when there are costs attached to being a generalist. The outcomes for soft and hard selection models are qualitatively different. Under soft selection (e.g., for juvenile or male‐reproductive traits) the population evolves towards the single peak in the adaptive landscape. At equilibrium, the population mean phenotype is a compromise between the reaction that would be optimal in both habitats and the reaction with the lowest cost. Furthermore, the equilibrium is closer to the optimal phenotype in the most frequent habitat, or the habitat in which selection on the focal trait is stronger. A specialist genotype always has a lower fitness than a generalist, even when the costs are high."
evolution,"Ethnocentrism is a nearly universal syndrome of attitudes and behaviors, typically including in-group favoritism. Empirical evidence suggests that a predisposition to favor in-groups can be easily triggered by even arbitrary group distinctions and that preferential cooperation within groups occurs even when it is individually costly. The authors study the emergence and robustness of ethnocentric behaviors of in-group favoritism, using an agent-based evolutionary model. They show that such behaviors can become widespread under a broad range of conditions and can support very high levels of cooperation, even in one-move prisoner’s dilemma games. When cooperation is especially costly to individuals, the authors show how ethnocentrism itself can be necessary to sustain cooperation."

But co-designing is actually not new at all, having taken distinctly different paths in the US and in Europe.  The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the roles of the designer, the researcher and the person formerly known as the ‘user’. The implications of this shift for the education of designers and researchers are enormous. The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the landscape of design practice as well, creating new domains of collective creativity. It is hoped that this evolution will support a transformation toward more sustainable ways of living in the future."
evolution,"Moral thinking pervades our practical lives, but where did this way of thinking come from, and what purpose does it serve? Is it to be explained by environmental pressures on our ancestors a million years ago, or is it a cultural invention of more recent origin? In The Evolution of Morality, Richard Joyce takes up these controversial questions, finding that the evidence supports an innate basis to human morality. As a moral philosopher, Joyce is interested in whether any implications follow from this hypothesis. Might the fact that the human brain has been biologically prepared by natural selection to engage in moral judgment serve in some sense to vindicate this way of thinking -- staving off the threat of moral skepticism, or even undergirding some version of moral realism? Or if morality has an adaptive explanation in genetic terms -- if it is, as Joyce writes, ""just something that helped our ancestors make more babies"" -- might such an explanation actually undermine morality's central role in our lives? He carefully examines both the evolutionary ""vindication of morality"" and the evolutionary ""debunking of morality,"" considering the skeptical view more seriously than have others who have treated the subject. Interdisciplinary and combining the latest results from the empirical sciences with philosophical discussion, The Evolution of Morality is one of the few books in this area written from the perspective of moral philosophy. Concise and without technical jargon, the arguments are rigorous but accessible to readers from different academic backgrounds. Joyce discusses complex issues in plain language while advocating subtle and sometimes radical views. The Evolution of Morality lays the philosophical foundations for further research into the biological understanding of human morality."
evolution,"An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signicantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution."

evolution,"The chloroplast, as the seat of chlorophyll pigments in plants, occupies a unique position in the economy of the green cell. In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the reactions and properties of chloroplasts as a result of the work of Hill (11, 12) and Hill and Scarisbrick (13, 14) who demonstrated that the reaction characteristic of photosynthesis in green plants, the evolution of oxygen, occurs in appreciable quantities in isolated chloroplasts under the influence of light and in the presence of suitable oxidants (2, 7, 8, 26). In the course of an investigation of oxygen evolution by isolated chloroplasts it was deemed important to explore their enzymatic composition. Of special interest were considered enzymes capable of participating in oxidation-reduction reactions, and more particularly, those localized principally, if not entirely, in the chloroplasts. This paper presents evidence that a copper enzyme, polyphenoloxidase (otherwise known as tyrosinase or catecholase), is localized in the chloroplasts of spinach beet (chard), Beta vu?garis."

evolution,"Many evolution processes are characterized by the fact that at certain moments of time they experience a change of state abruptly. These processes are subject to short-term perturbations whose duration is negligible in comparison with the duration of the process. Consequently, it is natural to assume that these perturbations act instantaneously, that is, in the form of impulses. It is known, for example, that many biological phenomena involving thresholds, bursting rhythm models in medicine and biology, optimal control models in economics, pharmacokinetics and frequency modulated systems, do exhibit impulsive effects. Thus impulsive differential equations, that is, differential equations involving impulse effects, appear as a natural description of observed evolution phenomena of several real world problems."
evolution,"There is an impressive history associated with the evolution of the concept and definition of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In this article, the author traces the evolution of the CSR construct beginning in the 1950s, which marks the modern era of CSR. Definitions expanded during the 1960s and proliferated during the 1970s. In the 1980s, there were fewer new definitions, more empirical research, and alternative themes began to mature. These alternative themes included corporate social performance (CSP), stakeholder theory, and business ethics theory.

Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation. Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene. Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely. Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.

evolution,"Acceptance of the theory of evolution as the means of explaining observed similarities and differences among organisms invites the construction of trees of descent purporting to show evolutionary relationships. Whether such trees are based on fossil or living specimens, they may often be criticized for having a high subjective element. The purpose of this paper is to show how suitable evolutionary models can be constructed and applied objectively. In it we amplify and extend the methods we have given in previous communications (Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza, 1963a, b, 1964, 1965; Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, 1964, 1966; Cavalli-Sforza, Barrai and Edwards, 1964; Cavalli-Sforza, 1966). Considering the great variety of information provided by living organisms, it is clear that the type of data will affect both the method of treatment and the validity of the results: the higher the correlation of data and genotype, the greater is the validity likely to be. Information on nucleic acid and protein structure comes first in the scale of relevance, and that on phenotypic measurements last; discrete and continuous variation demand different treatments, and evolutionary models appropriate to both cases will therefore be required for estimation purposes. Differences which are the result of mutation are formally discrete, and evolution a t the molecular level thus needs discontinuous treatment; but even in this case the limit of observation may turn the data into the"
evolution,"J.B.S. Haldane (1892-1964), one of the founders of the science of population genetics, was also one of the greatest practitioners of the art of explaining science to the layperson. Haldane was a superb story-teller, as his essays and his children's books attest. In The Causes of Evolution he not only helped to marry the new science of genetics to the older one of evolutionary theory but also provided an accessible introduction to the genetical basis of evolution by natural selection. Egbert Leigh's new introduction to this classic work places it in the context of the ongoing study of evolution. Describing Haldane's refusal to be confined by a ""System"" as a ""light-hearted"" one, Leigh points out that we are now finding that ""Haldane's questions are the appropriate next stage in learning how adaptation can evolve. We are now ready to reap the benefit of the fact that Haldane was a free man in the sense that really matters."""

evolution,"Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M☉ star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

evolution,"Phylogenetic trees of individual genes of prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria) generally have different topologies, largely owing to extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT), suggesting that the Tree of Life (TOL) should be replaced by a “net of life” as the paradigm of prokaryote evolution. However, trees remain the natural representation of the histories of individual genes given the fundamentally bifurcating process of gene replication. Therefore, although no single tree can fully represent the evolution of prokaryote genomes, the complete picture of evolution will necessarily combine trees and nets. A quantitative measure of the signals of tree and net evolution is derived from an analysis of all quartets of species in all trees of the “Forest of Life” (FOL), which consists of approximately 7,000 phylogenetic trees for prokaryote genes including approximately 100 nearly universal trees (NUTs). Although diverse routes of net-like evolution collectively dominate the FOL, the pattern of tree-like evolution that reflects the consistent topologies of the NUTs is the most prominent coherent trend. We show that the contributions of tree-like and net-like evolutionary processes substantially differ across bacterial and archaeal lineages and between functional classes of genes. Evolutionary simulations indicate that the central tree-like signal cannot be realistically explained by a self-reinforcing pattern of biased HGT."

Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 deg2 of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include the measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star.

evolution,"Summary 
1The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution has historically been a contentious issue because of debate over whether plasticity shields genotypes from selection or generates novel opportunities for selection to act. Because plasticity encompasses diverse adaptive and non-adaptive responses to environmental variation, no single conceptual framework adequately predicts the diverse roles of plasticity in evolutionary change. 
2Different types of phenotypic plasticity can uniquely contribute to adaptive evolution when populations are faced with new or altered environments. Adaptive plasticity should promote establishment and persistence in a new environment, but depending on how close the plastic response is to the new favoured phenotypic optimum dictates whether directional selection will cause adaptive divergence between populations. Further, non-adaptive plasticity in response to stressful environments can result in a mean phenotypic response being further away from the favoured optimum or alternatively increase the variance around the mean due to the expression of cryptic genetic variation. The expression of cryptic genetic variation can facilitate adaptive evolution if by chance it results in a fitter phenotype. 
3We conclude that adaptive plasticity that places populations close enough to a new phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time-scales in new environments. However, this type of plasticity is likely to be the product of past selection on variation that may have been initially non-adaptive. 
4We end with suggestions on how future empirical studies can be designed to better test the importance of different kinds of plasticity to adaptive evolution."
evolution,"SUMMARY In recent years researchers have analyzed the expression patterns of the Hox genes in a multitude of arthropod species, with the hope of understanding the mechanisms at work in the evolution of the arthropod body plan. Now, with Hox expression data representing all four major groups of arthropods (chelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans, and insects), it seems appropriate to summarize the results and take stock of what has been learned. In this review we summarize the expression and functional data regarding the 10 arthropod Hox genes: labial, proboscipedia, Hox3/zen, Deformed, Sex combs reduced, fushi tarazu, Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, abdominal‐A, and Abdominal‐B. In addition, we discuss mechanisms of developmental evolutionary change thought to be important for the emergence of novel morphological features within the arthropods."

evolution,"The application of lean thinking has made a significant impact both in academic and industrial circles over the last decade. Fostered by a rapid spread into many other industry sectors beyond the automotive industry, there has been a significant development and “localisation” of the lean concept. Despite successful “lean” applications in a range of settings however, the lean approach has been criticised on many accounts, such as the lack of human integration or its limited applicability outside high‐volume repetitive manufacturing environments. The resulting lack of definition has led to confusion and fuzzy boundaries with other management concepts. Summarising the lean evolution, this paper comments on approaches that have sought to address some of the earlier gaps in lean thinking. Linking the evolution of lean thinking to the contingency and learning organisation schools of thought, the objective of this paper is to provide a framework for understanding the evolution of lean not only as a concept, but also its implementation within an organisation, and point out areas for future research."
evolution,"Songs are complex acoustic signals produced mainly during the mating season. Such signals are found in many taxa but are most typical of birds, frogs, and insects. Darwin (38) noted that in these groups males are the predominant singers, and for this reason he attributed the evolution of song to sexual selection, that is, selection due to competition for mates. Darwin could muster no direct evidence that song or other display influences mating suc­ cess; only recently has such evidence begun to accumulate. Our fIrst goal here is to review and evaluate evidence that song influences mating success, via either female choice or male contests. Although convinced that sexual selection shapes display behavior, Darwin could not explain the evolution of a relationship between display and mating success. Fisher (50) first gave such an explanation in his discussion of female choice and male threat display. Our second goal is to review ideas and evidence on the evolution of relationships between song and female choice, and between song and success in male contests. We focus on the question of why listeners have evolved to respond to song in the contexts of female choice and male contest."
evolution,"Changes in gene expression and regulation--due in particular to the evolution of cis-regulatory DNA sequences--may underlie many evolutionary changes in phenotypes, yet little is known about the distribution of such variation in populations. We present in this study the first survey of experimentally validated functional cis-regulatory polymorphism. These data are derived from more than 140 polymorphisms involved in the regulation of 107 genes in Homo sapiens, the eukaryote species with the most available data. We find that functional cis-regulatory variation is widespread in the human genome and that the consequent variation in gene expression is twofold or greater for 63% of the genes surveyed. Transcription factor-DNA interactions are highly polymorphic, and regulatory interactions have been gained and lost within human populations. On average, humans are heterozygous at more functional cis-regulatory sites (>16,000) than at amino acid positions (<13,000), in part because of an overrepresentation among the former in multiallelic tandem repeat variation, especially (AC)(n) dinucleotide microsatellites. The role of microsatellites in gene expression variation may provide a larger store of heritable phenotypic variation, and a more rapid mutational input of such variation, than has been realized. Finally, we outline the distinctive consequences of cis-regulatory variation for the genotype-phenotype relationship, including ubiquitous epistasis and genotype-by-environment interactions, as well as underappreciated modes of pleiotropy and overdominance. Ordinary small-scale mutations contribute to pervasive variation in transcription rates and consequently to patterns of human phenotypic variation."
evolution,"Three main streams of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), probabilistic optimization algorithms based on the model of natural evolution, are compared in this article: evolution strategies (ESs), evolutionary programming (EP), and genetic algorithms (GAs). The comparison is performed with respect to certain characteristic components of EAs: the representation scheme of object variables, mutation, recombination, and the selection operator. Furthermore, each algorithm is formulated in a high-level notation as an instance of the general, unifying basic algorithm, and the fundamental theoretical results on the algorithms are presented. Finally, after presenting experimental results for three test functions representing a unimodal and a multimodal case as well as a step function with discontinuities, similarities and differences of the algorithms are elaborated, and some hints to open research questions are sketched."
evolution,"The seemingly innocent observation that the activities of organisms bring about changes in environments is so obvious that it seems an unlikely focus for a new line of thinking about evolution. Yet niche construction - as this process of organism-driven environmental modification is known - has hidden complexities. By transforming biotic and abiotic sources of natural selection in external environments, niche construction generates feedback in evolution on a scale hitherto underestimated - and in a manner that transforms the evolutionary dynamic. It also plays a critical role in ecology, supporting ecosystem engineering and influencing the flow of energy and nutrients through ecosystems. Despite this, niche construction has been given short shrift in theoretical biology, in part because it cannot be fully understood within the framework of standard evolutionary theory. Wedding evolution and ecology, this book extends evolutionary theory by formally including niche construction and ecological inheritance as additional evolutionary processes. The authors support their historic move with empirical data, theoretical population genetics, and conceptual models. They also describe new research methods capable of testing the theory. They demonstrate how their theory can resolve long-standing problems in ecology, particularly by advancing the sorely needed synthesis of ecology and evolution, and how it offers an evolutionary basis for the human sciences. Already hailed as a pioneering work by some of the world's most influential biologists, this is a rare, potentially field-changing contribution to the biological sciences."
evolution,"This critical review shows the basis of photocatalytic water splitting and experimental points, and surveys heterogeneous photocatalyst materials for water splitting into H2 and O2, and H2 or O2 evolution from an aqueous solution containing a sacrificial reagent. Many oxides consisting of metal cations with d0 and d10 configurations, metal (oxy)sulfide and metal (oxy)nitride photocatalysts have been reported, especially during the latest decade. The fruitful photocatalyst library gives important information on factors affecting photocatalytic performances and design of new materials. Photocatalytic water splitting and H2 evolution using abundant compounds as electron donors are expected to contribute to construction of a clean and simple system for solar hydrogen production, and a solution of global energy and environmental issues in the future (361 references)."
evolution,"Charles Darwin proposed that evolution occurs primarily by natural selection, but this view has been controversial from the beginning. Two of the major opposing views have been mutationism and neutralism. Early molecular studies suggested that most amino acid substitutions in proteins are neutral or nearly neutral and the functional change of proteins occurs by a few key amino acid substitutions. This suggestion generated an intense controversy over selectionism and neutralism. This controversy is partially caused by Kimura's definition of neutrality, which was too strict (|2Ns|< or =1). If we define neutral mutations as the mutations that do not change the function of gene products appreciably, many controversies disappear because slightly deleterious and slightly advantageous mutations are engulfed by neutral mutations. The ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution to that of synonymous substitution is a useful quantity to study positive Darwinian selection operating at highly variable genetic loci, but it does not necessarily detect adaptively important codons. Previously, multigene families were thought to evolve following the model of concerted evolution, but new evidence indicates that most of them evolve by a birth-and-death process of duplicate genes. It is now clear that most phenotypic characters or genetic systems such as the adaptive immune system in vertebrates are controlled by the interaction of a number of multigene families, which are often evolutionarily related and are subject to birth-and-death evolution. Therefore, it is important to study the mechanisms of gene family interaction for understanding phenotypic evolution. Because gene duplication occurs more or less at random, phenotypic evolution contains some fortuitous elements, though the environmental factors also play an important role. The randomness of phenotypic evolution is qualitatively different from allele frequency changes by random genetic drift. However, there is some similarity between phenotypic and molecular evolution with respect to functional or environmental constraints and evolutionary rate. It appears that mutation (including gene duplication and other DNA changes) is the driving force of evolution at both the genic and the phenotypic levels."

evolution,"The Neutral Theory Models describing the dynamics of genetic variants with no effect on fitness—so-called neutral models—have been around almost as long as the field of population genetics (Fisher 1922; Wright 1931). Decades after the first models were introduced Motoo Kimura gave a complete description of the dynamics of neutral mutations in finite populations, using mathematical tools borrowed from particle physics (Kimura 1955). Although the elegance of this and other results from Kimura and colleagues were uncontested, their applicability to data seemed remote until experiments revealed enormous amounts of molecular genetic variation, both within and between species (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965; Harris 1966; Lewontin and Hubby 1966). The observed levels of variation appeared inconsistent with models that proposed selective effects for all or most mutations, and what has become known as the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution was born (Kimura 1968; King and Jukes 1969; Kimura and Ohta 1971). Despite contentious argument over the validity of the Neutral Theory (Kimura 1983; Gillespie 1991), it has become the predominant framework for research in population genetics and molecular evolution for almost 40 years. Increasingly complex models describing the expected patterns of variation within and between species allow researchers to ask about the evolutionary processes acting in nature, both at single loci and in increasingly large datasets encompassing all or most genes in a genome. The Neutral Theory provides a theoretical basis for understanding DNA variation with clear, testable hypotheses and an array of statistical tools that distinguish natural selection from random genetic drift (Kreitman 2000; Nielsen 2001; Hahn 2007). However, the recent paper by Begun and colleagues (Begun et al. 2007) should finally begin to change people’s view of this scientific paradigm. Although results inconsistent with the Neutral Theory have been mounting for some time (see below), the field has continued to use it as a foundation for understanding the molecular world. As the first true “population genomic” dataset, the results of Begun et al. force us to see that the central predictions of the Neutral Theory do not hold in natural populations. Far from just the half-caught glimpses of nonneutral evolution afforded by studies of limited numbers of loci, by sequencing the whole genomes of multiple lines of Drosophila simulans this work should cause a major shift in how we interpret DNA variation within populations and among species. As the conclusions of this article are appropriately cautious with respect to the implications of the work, I will use this essay to provide a wider view of the importance of these results and a synthesis with previous results. To do this I will address the two major tenets of the Neutral Theory, and how increasing amounts of data are showing that these claims and their attendant predictions do not hold for the vast majority of genes and species. I also argue that the implications of our continued use of neutral models are dire—at"
evolution,"The possibility that the evolution of mating preferences and secondary sex traits can be based on heritable differences in viability is examined with a three‐locus model. Earlier genetic models suggested that viability‐based processes alone cannot explain the evolution of mate choice and sex ornaments that reduce survival; a Fisherian mating advantage seemed necessary. The present model is based on a monogamous mating system that precludes such a mating advantage. A key assumption is that ornament development depends on the phenotypic condition and overall genotype of the possessor; there is evidence that secondary sex traits often mirror nutritional status and health, sometimes through hormonal mediation. Ornament and preference can then hitchhike slowly to high frequency with alleles that confer a slight survival advantage, provided that such alleles become available often enough. The evolution of mating preferences and secondary sex traits that reflect overall genotypic constitution therefore can be based solely on viability differences, no Fisherian mating advantage being required. In practice, these and several other mechanisms of sexual selection may occur together."
evolution,"For an arbitrary quantum evolution, it is shown that the integral of the uncertainty of energy with respect to time is independent of the particular Hamiltonian used to transport the quantum system along a given curve in the projective Hilbert space. It is the distance along this curve measured by the Fubini-Study metric. This gives a new time-energy uncertainty principle. New geometric meanings to time as measured by a clock and the transition probability during a quantum measurement are also obtained."
evolution,"A codon-based model for the evolution of protein-coding DNA sequences is presented for use in phylogenetic estimation. A Markov process is used to describe substitutions between codons. Transition/transversion rate bias and codon usage bias are allowed in the model, and selective restraints at the protein level are accommodated using physicochemical distances between the amino acids coded for by the codons. Analyses of two data sets suggest that the new codon-based model can provide a better fit to data than can nucleotide-based models and can produce more reliable estimates of certain biologically important measures such as the transition/transversion rate ratio and the synonymous/nonsynonymous substitution rate ratio."

evolution,"Proteolytic enzymes have many physiological functions, ranging from generalized protein digestion to more specific regulated processes such as the activation of zymogens, blood coagulation and the lysis of fibrin clots, the release of hormones and pharmacologically active peptides from precursor proteins, and the transport of secretory proteins across membranes. They are present in all forms of living organisms. Comparisons of amino acid sequences, three-dimensional structures, and enzymatic reaction mechanisms of proteases indicate that there are distinct families of these proteins. Changes in molecular structure and function have accompanied the evolution of proteolytic enzymes and their inhibitors, each having relatively simple roles in primitive organisms and more diverse and more complex functions in higher organisms."

evolution,"Organismal performance abilities occupy a central position in phenotypic evolution; they are determined by suites of interacting lower‐level traits (e.g., morphology and physiology) and they are a primary focus of natural selection. The mechanisms by which higher levels of organismal performance are achieved during evolution are therefore fundamentally important for understanding correlated evolution in general and coadaptation in particular. Here we address correlated evolution of morphological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics that influence interspecific variation in sprint speed in a clade of lacertid lizards. Phylogenetic analyses using independent contrasts indicate that the evolution of high maximum sprinting abilities (measured on a photocell‐timed racetrack) has occurred via the evolution of (1) longer hind limbs relative to body size, and (2) a higher physiologically optimum temperature for sprinting. For ectotherms, which experience variable body temperatures while active, sprinting abilities in nature depend on both maximum capacities and relative performance levels (i.e., percent of maximum) that can be attained. With respect to temperature effects, relative performance levels are determined by the interaction between thermal physiology and thermoregulatory behavior. Among the 13 species or subspecies of lizards in the present study, differences in the optimal temperature for sprinting (body temperature at which lizards run fastest) closely matched interspecific variation in median preferred body temperature (measured in a laboratory photothermal gradient), indicating correlated evolution of thermal physiology and thermal preferences. Variability of the preferred body temperatures maintained by each species is, across species, negatively correlated with the thermal‐performance breadth (range of body temperatures over which lizards can run relatively fast). This pattern leads to interspecific differences in the levels of relative sprint speed that lizards are predicted to attain while active at their preferred temperatures. The highest levels of predicted relative performance are achieved by species that combine a narrow, precise distribution of preferred temperatures with the ability to sprint at near‐maximum speeds over a wide range of body temperatures. The observed among‐species differences in predicted relative speed were positively correlated with the interspecific variation in maximum sprinting capacities. Thus, species that attain the highest maximum speeds are (1) also able to run at near‐maximum levels over a wide range of temperatures and (2) also maintain body temperatures within a narrow zone near the optimal temperature for sprinting. The observed pattern of correlated evolution therefore has involved traits at distinct levels of biological organization, that is, morphology, physiology, and behavior; and trade‐offs are not evident. We hypothesize that this particular trait combination has evolved in response to coadaptational selection pressures. We also discuss our results in the context of possible evolutionary responses to global climatic change."

evolution,"The high error rate inherent in all RNA synthesis provides RNA virus genomes with extremely high mutation rates. Thus nearly all large RNA virus clonal populations are quasispecies collections of differing, related genomes (14, 49). These rapidly mutating populations can remain remarkably stable under certain conditions of replication. Under other conditions, virus-population equilibria become disturbed, and extremely rapid evolution can result. This extreme variability and rapid evolution can cause severe problems with previously unknown virus diseases (such as AIDS). It also presents daunting challenges for the design of effective vaccines for the control of diseases caused by rapidly evolving RNA virus populations."
evolution,"The nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) to synonymous (silent) substitution rate ratio (omega = d(N)/d(S)) provides a measure of natural selection at the protein level, with omega = 1, >1, and <1, indicating neutral evolution, purifying selection, and positive selection, respectively. Previous studies that used this measure to detect positive selection have often taken an approach of pairwise comparison, estimating substitution rates by averaging over all sites in the protein. As most amino acids in a functional protein are under structural and functional constraints and adaptive evolution probably affects only a few sites at a few time points, this approach of averaging rates over sites and over time has little power. Previously, we developed codon-based substitution models that allow the omega ratio to vary either among lineages or among sites. In this paper we extend previous models to allow the omega ratio to vary both among sites and among lineages and implement the new models in the likelihood framework. These models may be useful for identifying positive selection along prespecified lineages that affects only a few sites in the protein. We apply those branch-site models as well as previous branch- and site-specific models to three data sets: the lysozyme genes from primates, the tumor suppressor BRCA1 genes from primates, and the phytochrome (PHY) gene family in angiosperms. Positive selection is detected in the lysozyme and BRCA genes by both the new and the old models. However, only the new models detected positive selection acting on lineages after gene duplication in the PHY gene family. Additional tests on several data sets suggest that the new models may be useful in detecting positive selection after gene duplication in gene family evolution."
evolution,"Abstract “Dollo's law” states that, following loss, a complex trait cannot reevolve in an identical manner. Although the law has previously fallen into disrepute, it has only recently been challenged with statistical phylogenetic methods. We employ simulation studies of an irreversible binary character to show that rejections of Dollo's law based on likelihood-ratio tests of transition rate constraints or on reconstructions of ancestral states are frequently incorrect. We identify two major causes of errors: incorrect assignment of root state frequencies, and neglect of the effect of the character state on rates of speciation and extinction. Our findings do not necessarily overturn the conclusions of phylogenetic studies claiming reversals, but we demonstrate devastating flaws in the methods that are the foundation of all such studies. Furthermore, we show that false rejections of Dollo's law can be reduced by the use of appropriate existing models and model selection procedures. More powerful tests of irreversibility require data beyond phylogenies and character states of extant taxa, and we highlight empirical work that incorporates additional information."
evolution,"‘Approximate message passing’ algorithms proved to be extremely effective in reconstructing sparse signals from a small number of incoherent linear measurements. Extensive numerical experiments further showed that their dynamics is accurately tracked by a simple one-dimensional iteration termed state evolution. In this paper we provide the first rigorous foundation to state evolution. We prove that indeed it holds asymptotically in the large system limit for sensing matrices with iid gaussian entries. While our focus is on message passing algorithms for compressed sensing, the analysis extends beyond this setting, to a general class of algorithms on dense graphs. In this context, state evolution plays the role that density evolution has for sparse graphs."
evolution,"The substance of this article was delivered as the Presidential Address to the Society for the Study of Evolution, December 30, 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts. Attention is drawn to evolutionary studies in the tropics which appear to be advancing the subject significantly. Then, detailed attention is given to the possible evolutionary bases of the most striking biological characteristic of the tropics: the extraordinary floristic and faunistic diversity of tropical ecosystems. Because most contributions to the discussion of this topic have come from zoologists, the emphasis here is placed on botanical aspects. It is concluded that each of several potential explanations for the diversity may be valid and that a great need for the future is synthesis rather than arbitration between theories. THERE ARE MANY reasons why, as we come to the end of the 1960's, we should pay attention to what is happening in the study of evolution in the tropics. After many years of neglect, the tropics are getting more study by ecologists-and where the ecologists find their stimulation and their information there is also material for evolutionists, provided that we are still interested, as they are, in adaptation. Despite recent claims by molecular biologists (e.g., King and Jukes 1969, Wilson and Sarich 1969) for nonselective biochemical evolution, I believe that adaptation, maintained by natural selection, is still the cornerstone of the evolutionary edifice-and the tropics provide superb opportunities for studying multifarious examples of adaptation in action. Quite recently there have been important advances, with evolutionary significance, in several areas of tropical biology, and I should like to draw attention to some of them. For example, one of the most exciting developments in plant physiology in the last few years has been the demonstration that there are at least two biochemical pathways along which photosynthesis by flowering plants may proceed. The conventional or Calvin pathway (Calvin and Bassham 1962) involves phosphorylated chemical compounds with three carbon atoms while the more recently discovered pathway (Hatch and Slack 1966) involves four-carbon, dicarboxylic acids as early products of photosynthesis. Plants using the four-carbon pathway can fix carbon dioxide at rates up to twice that of those using the conventional mechanism, at least partly because they waste nothing in photorespiration. Correspondingly, their carbon dioxide compensation points (the level of CO2 in the atmosphere at which respiration just balances photosynthesis) are extremely low. Furthermore, they have peculiarities in the bundle sheaths of the leaves (Laetsch 1968) by which they may be recognized, as well as leaf structures which reduce gaseous exchange. Accumulation of carbon dioxide is facilitated under certain dark circumstances and, because C4 photosynthesis is not inhibited by accumulating oxygen during illumination (Olle Bjorkman, pers. comm.), their photosynthetic rates continue to increase as light intensities up to the maximum experienced in daylight are reached. Photosynthesis also continues even when dissolved carbon dioxide concentrations in the cells are reduced to low levels"
evolution,"Wing‐dimorphic insects are excellent subjects for a study of the evolution of dispersal since the nondispersing brachypterous morph is easily recognized. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework within which the evolution of wing dimorphism can be understood. A review of the literature indicates that the presence or absence of wings may be controlled by a single locus, two‐allele genetic system or a polygenic system. Both types of inheritance can be subsumed within a general threshold model."

evolution,"I tested biomechanical predictions that morphological proportions (snout–vent length, forelimb length, hindlimb length, tail length, and mass) and maximal sprinting and jumping ability have evolved concordantly among 15 species of Anolis lizards from Jamaica and Puerto Rico. Based on a phylogenetic hypothesis for these species, the ancestor reconstruction and contrast approaches were used to test hypotheses that variables coevolved. Evolutionary change in all morphological and performance variables scales positively with evolution of body size (represented by snout–vent length); size evolution accounts for greater than 50% of the variance in sprinting and jumping evolution. With the effect of the evolution of body size removed, increases in hindlimb length are associated with increases in sprinting and jumping capability. When further variables are removed, evolution in forelimb and tail length exhibits a negative relationship with evolution of both performance measures. The success of the biomechanical predictions indicates that the assumption that evolution in other variables (e.g., muscle mass and composition) did not affect performance evolution is probably correct; evolution of the morphological variables accounts for approximately 80% of the evolutionary change in performance ability. In this case, however, such assumptions are clade‐specific; extrapolation to taxa outside the clade is thus unwarranted. The results have implications concerning ecomorphological evolution. The observed relationship between forelimb and tail length and ecology probably is a spurious result of the correlation between these variables and hindlimb length. Further, because the evolution of jumping and sprinting ability are closely linked, the ability to adapt to certain microhabitats may be limited."
evolution,High in the Canadian Rockies is a small limestone quarry formed 530 million years ago called the Burgess Shale. It hold the remains of an ancient sea where dozens of strange creatures lived-a forgotten corner of evolution preserved in awesome detail. In this book Stephen Jay Gould explores what the Burgess Shale tells us about evolution and the nature of history.
evolution,"Abstract The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal α = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25% of traits) and/or ACDC (40%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses."
evolution,"We extend methods of quantitative genetics to studies of the evolution of reaction norms defined over continuous environments. Our models consider both spatial variation (hard and soft selection) and temporal variation (within a generation and between generations). These different forms of environmental variation can produce different evolutionary trajectories even when they favor the same optimal reaction norm. When genetic constraints limit the types of evolutionary changes available to a reaction norm, different forms of environmental variation can also produce different evolutionary equilibria. The methods and models presented here provide a framework in which empiricists may determine whether a reaction norm is optimal and, if it is not, to evaluate hypotheses for why it is not."
evolution,"Abstract In the past decade, the academic community has increased considerably its activity concerning the teaching and learning of evolution. Despite such beneficial activity, the state of public understanding of evolution is considered woefully lacking by most researchers and educators. This lack of understanding affects evolution/science literacy, research, and academia in general. Not only does the general public lack an understanding of evolution but so does a considerable proportion of college graduates. However, it is not just evolutionary concepts that students do not retain. In general, college students retain little of what they supposedly have learned. Worse yet, it is not just students who have avoided science and math who fail to retain fundamental science concepts. Students who have had extensive secondary-level and college courses in science have similar deficits. We examine these issues and explore what distinguishes effective pedagogy from ineffective pedagogy in higher education in general and evolution education in particular. The fundamental problem of students' prior conceptions is considered and why prior conceptions often underpin students' misunderstanding of the evolutionary concepts being taught. These conceptions can often be discovered and addressed. We also attend to concerns about coverage of course content and the influence of religious beliefs, and provide helpful strategies to improve college-level teaching of evolution."

evolution,"The joint evolution of female mating preferences and secondary sexual characters of males is modeled for polygamous species in which males provide only genetic material to the next generation and females have many potential mates to choose among. Despite stabilizing natural selection on males, various types of mating preferences may create a runaway process in which the outcome of phenotypic evolution depends critically on the genetic variation parameters and initial conditions of a population. Even in the absence of genetic instability, rapid evolution can result from an interaction of natural and sexual selection with random genetic drift along lines of equilibria. The models elucidate genetic mechanisms that can initiate or contribute to rapid speciation by sexual isolation and divergence of secondary sexual characters."
evolution,"Abstract A long-standing question in evolutionary and developmental biology concerns the relative contribution of cis-regulatory and protein changes to developmental evolution. Central to this argument is which mutations generate evolutionarily relevant phenotypic variation? A review of the growing body of evolutionary and developmental literature supports the notion that many developmentally relevant differences occur in the cis-regulatory regions of protein-coding genes, generally to the exclusion of changes in the protein-coding region of genes. However, accumulating experimental evidence demonstrates that many of the arguments against a role for proteins in the evolution of gene regulation, and the developmental evolution in general, are no longer supported and there is an increasing number of cases in which transcription factor protein changes have been demonstrated in evolution. Here, we review the evidence that cis-regulatory evolution is an important driver of phenotypic evolution and provide examples of protein-mediated developmental evolution. Finally, we present an argument that the evolution of proteins may play a more substantial, but thus far underestimated, role in developmental evolution."

evolution,"Despite recent, compelling challenge, the evolution of Homo erectus is still commonly attributed to big game hunting and/or scavenging and family provisioning by men. Here we use a version of the ""grandmother"" hypothesis to develop an alternative scenario, that climate-driven adjustments in female foraging and food sharing practices, possibly involving tubers, favored significant changes in ancestral life history, morphology, and ecology leading to the appearance, spread and persistence of H. erectus. Available paleoclimatic, environmental, fossil and archaeological data are consistent with this proposition; avenues for further critical research are readily identified. This argument has important implications for widely-held ideas about the recent evolution of long human lifespans, the prevalence of male philopatry among ancestral hominids, and the catalytic role of big game hunting and scavenging in early human evolution."
evolution,"In many insect species, males infected with microbes related to Wolbachia pipientis are “incompatible” with uninfected females. Crosses between infected males and uninfected females produce significantly fewer adult progeny than the other three possible crosses. The incompatibility‐inducing microbes are usually maternally transmitted. Thus, incompatibility tends to confer a reproductive advantage on infected females in polymorphic populations, allowing these infections to spread. This paper analyzes selection on parasite and host genes that affect such incompatibility systems. Selection among parasite variants does not act directly on the level of incompatibility with uninfected females. In fact, selection favors rare parasite variants that increase the production of infected progeny by infected mothers, even if these variants reduce incompatibility with uninfected females. However, productivity‐reducing parasites that cause partial incompatibility with hosts harboring alternative variants can be favored once they become sufficiently abundant locally. Thus, they may spread spatially by a process analogous to the spread of underdominant chromosome rearrangements. The dynamics of modifier alleles in the host are more difficult to predict, because such alleles will occur in both infected and uninfected individuals. Nevertheless, the relative fecundity of infected females compared to uninfected females, the efficiency of maternal transmission and the mutual compatibility of infected individuals all tend to increase under within‐population selection on both host and parasite genes. In addition, selection on host genes favors increased compatibility between infected males and uninfected females. Although vertical transmission tends to harmonize host and parasite evolution, competition among parasite variants will tend to maintain incompatibility."

evolution,"Because of functional constraints, substitution rates vary among the positions of a protein but are usually assumed to be constant at a given site during evolution. The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generally fits a Gamma distribution. Models of sequence evolution were accordingly designed and led to improved phylogenetic reconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy (for ""different speed"" in Greek). Yet, heterotachy was found among homologous sequences of distantly related organisms, often with different functions. In such cases, the functional constraints are likely different, which would explain the different distribution of variable sites. To evaluate the importance of heterotachy, we focused on amino acid sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b, for which the function is likely the same in all vertebrates. Using 2,038 sequences, we demonstrate that 95% of the variable positions are heterotachous, i.e., underwent dramatic variations of substitution rate among vertebrate lineages. Heterotachy even occurs at small evolutionary scale, and in these cases it is very unlikely to be related to functional changes. Since a large number of sequences are required to efficiently detect heterotachy, the extent of this phenomenon could not be estimated for all proteins yet. It could be as large as for cytochrome b, since this protein is not a peculiar case. The observations made here open several new avenues of research, such as the understanding of the evolution of functional constraints or the improvement of phylogenetic reconstruction methods."
evolution,"Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue in the identification of functional sequence features. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We have analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 14.3 Mb of primate noncoding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.61, P </= 2 10(-16)) with the rate of crossovers (notably in females). This demonstrates that recombination drives the evolution of base composition in human (probably via the process of biased gene conversion). The present substitution patterns are very different from what they had been in the past, resulting in a major modification of the isochore structure of our genome. This non-equilibrium situation suggests that changes of recombination rates occur relatively frequently during evolution, possibly as a consequence of karyotype rearrangements. These results have important implications for understanding the spatial and temporal variations of substitution processes in a broad range of sexual organisms, and for detecting the hallmarks of natural selection in DNA sequences."

evolution,"Abstract The claim that human culture evolves through the differential adoption of cultural variants, in a manner analogous to the evolution of biological species, has been greeted with much resistance and confusion. Here we demonstrate that as compelling a case can now be made that cultural evolution has key Darwinian properties, as Darwin himself presented for biological evolution in The Origin of Species. Culture is shown to exhibit variation, competition, inheritance, and the accumulation of successive cultural modifications over time. Adaptation, convergence, and the loss or change of function can also be identified in culture. Just as Darwin knew nothing of genes or particulate inheritance, a case for Darwinian cultural evolution can be made irrespective of whether unitary cultural replicators exist or whether cultural transmission mechanisms are well understood."
evolution,"Current understanding of the diversification of birds is hindered by their incomplete fossil record and uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships and phylogenetic rates of molecular evolution. Here we performed the first comprehensive analysis of mitogenomic data of 48 vertebrates, including 35 birds, to derive a Bayesian timescale for avian evolution and to estimate rates of DNA evolution. Our approach used multiple fossil time constraints scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree and accounts for uncertainties in time constraints, branch lengths, and heterogeneity of rates of DNA evolution. We estimated that the major vertebrate lineages originated in the Permian; the 95% credible intervals of our estimated ages of the origin of archosaurs (258 MYA), the amniote-amphibian split (356 MYA), and the archosaur-lizard divergence (278 MYA) bracket estimates from the fossil record. The origin of modern orders of birds was estimated to have occurred throughout the Cretaceous beginning about 139 MYA, arguing against a cataclysmic extinction of lineages at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. We identified fossils that are useful as time constraints within vertebrates. Our timescale reveals that rates of molecular evolution vary across genes and among taxa through time, thereby refuting the widely used mitogenomic or cytochrome b molecular clock in birds. Moreover, the 5-Myr divergence time assumed between 2 genera of geese (Branta and Anser) to originally calibrate the standard mitochondrial clock rate of 0.01 substitutions per site per lineage per Myr (s/s/l/Myr) in birds was shown to be underestimated by about 9.5 Myr. Phylogenetic rates in birds vary between 0.0009 and 0.012 s/s/l/Myr, indicating that many phylogenetic splits among avian taxa also have been underestimated and need to be revised. We found no support for the hypothesis that the molecular clock in birds ""ticks"" according to a constant rate of substitution per unit of mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit of time, as recently suggested. Our analysis advances knowledge of rates of DNA evolution across birds and other vertebrates and will, therefore, aid comparative biology studies that seek to infer the origin and timing of major adaptive shifts in vertebrates."
evolution,"Comparative studies tend to differ from optimality and functionality studies in how they treat adaptation. While the comparative approach focuses on the origin and change of traits, optimality studies assume that adaptations are maintained at an optimum by stabilizing selection. This paper presents a model of adaptive evolution on a macroevolutionary time scale that includes the maintenance of traits at adaptive optima by stabilizing selection as the dominant evolutionary force. Interspecific variation is treated as variation in the position of adaptive optima. The model illustrates how phylogenetic constraints not only lead to correlations between phylogenetically related species, but also to imperfect adaptations. From this model, a statistical comparative method is derived that can be used to estimate the effect of a selective factor on adaptive optima in a way that would be consistent with an optimality study of adaptation to this factor. The method is illustrated with an analysis of dental evolution in fossil horses. The use of comparative methods to study evolutionary trends is also discussed."
evolution,"Evolutionary theorists not only point to the survival value of the present structure and function of an organism, they try to reconstruct earlier stages which should also have had survival value. An example of current interest is the flight of birds. Feathers may have evolved first as thermal insulation, but what about wings? Were they adaptations of forelimbs which first helped animals run faster or that helped tree animals leap from branch to branch or from branch to ground? (Even when a feature first evolved because of consequences quite different from those which explain its current survival value, a plausible early history is still needed.) Among the features to be explained in this way is behavior. The current survival value of reflexes and the released patterns of behavior studied by ethologists may be clear, but can we construct plausible sequences through which they could have evolved, with survival value at every stage? The first behavior was presumably simple movement-like that of the amoeba reaching out into new territory and hence increasing its chances of finding materials necessary for its survival. A plausible second step was sensing, as the result of which movement could take the organism away from harmful stimuli and closer to useful materials. The assignment of different organs to sensing and moving should have led to the evolution of connecting structures, and eventually to tropisms and reflexes. The released behavior patterns studied by ethologists also presumably evolved through increasingly complex stages. It is unlikely that many current instances occurred first in their present state as variations which were then selected by survival. In my paper ""The Shaping of Phylogenic Behavior"" (Skinner, 1975),"
evolution,"The idea that vertical transmission of parasites selects for lower virulence is widely accepted. However, little theoretical work has considered the evolution of virulence for parasites with mixed horizontal plus vertical transmission. Many human, animal, and plant parasites are transmitted both vertically and horizontally, and some horizontal transmission is generally necessary to maintain parasites at all. We present a population‐dynamical model for the evolution of virulence when both vertical and horizontal transmission are present. In the simplest such model, up to two infectious strains can coexist within one host population. Virulent, vertically transmitted pathogens can persist in a population when they provide protection against more virulent, horizontally transmitted strains. When virulence is maintained by a correlation with horizontal transmission rates, increased levels of vertical transmission always lower the evolutionarily stable (ESS) level of virulence. Contrary to existing theory, however, increases in opportunities for horizontal transmission also lower the ESS level of virulence. We explain these findings in light of earlier work and confirm them in simulations including imperfect vertical transmission. We describe further simulations, in which both vertical and horizontal transmission rates are allowed to evolve. The outcome of these simulations depends on whether high levels of vertical transmission are possible with low virulence. Finally, we argue against the notion of a virulence‐avirulence continuum between horizontal and vertical transmission, and discuss our results in relation to empirical studies of transmission and virulence."
evolution,"Biological evolution is a fact--but the many conflicting theories of evolution remain controversial even today. In 1966, simple Darwinism, which holds that evolution functions primarily at the level of the individual organism, was threatened by opposing concepts such as group selection, a popular idea stating that evolution acts to select entire species rather than individuals. George Williams's famous argument in favor of the Darwinists struck a powerful blow to those in opposing camps. His ""Adaptation and Natural Selection, "" now a classic of science literature, is a thorough and convincing essay in defense of Darwinism; its suggestions for developing effective principles for dealing with the evolution debate and its relevance to many fields outside biology ensure the timelessness of this critical work."
evolution,"Females of all species belonging to the family Drosophilidae have two kinds of sperm‐storage organs: paired spherical spermathecae and a single elongate tubular seminal receptacle. We examined 113 species belonging to the genus Drosophila and closely allied genera and describe variation in female sperm‐storage organ use and morphology. The macroevolutionary pattern of organ dysfunction and morphological divergence suggests that ancestrally both kinds of organs stored sperm. Loss of use of the spermathecae has evolved at least 13 times; evolutionary regain of spermathecal function has rarely if ever occurred. Loss of use of the seminal receptacle has likely occurred only once; in this case, all descendant species possess unusually elaborate spermathecae. Data further indicate that the seminal receptacle is the primary sperm‐storage organ in Drosophila. This organ exhibits a pattern of strong correlated evolution with the length of sperm. The evolution of multiple kinds of female sperm‐storage organs and the rapidly divergent and correlated evolution of sperm and female reproductive tract morphology are discussed."
evolution,"Abstract Beetles in the weevil subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae are unusual in that they burrow as adults inside trees for feeding and oviposition. Some of these beetles are known as ambrosia beetles for their obligate mutualisms with asexual fungi—known as ambrosia fungi—that are derived from plant pathogens in the ascomycete group known as the ophiostomatoid fungi. Other beetles in these subfamilies are known as bark beetles and are associated with free-living, pathogenic ophiostomatoid fungi that facilitate beetle attack of phloem of trees with resin defenses. Using DNA sequences from six genes, including both copies of the nuclear gene encoding enolase, we performed a molecular phylogenetic study of bark and ambrosia beetles across these two subfamilies to establish the rate and direction of changes in life histories and their consequences for diversification. The ambrosia beetle habits have evolved repeatedly and are unreversed. The subfamily Platypodinae is derived from within the Scolytinae, near the tribe Scolytini. Comparison of the molecular branch lengths of ambrosia beetles and ambrosia fungi reveals a strong correlation, which a fungal molecular clock suggests spans 60 to 21 million years. Bark beetles have shifted from ancestral association with conifers to angiosperms and back again several times. Each shift to angiosperms is associated with elevated diversity, whereas the reverse shifts to conifers are associated with lowered diversity. The unusual habit of adult burrowing likely facilitated the diversification of these beetle-fungus associations, enabling them to use the biomass-rich resource that trees represent and set the stage for at least one origin of eusociality.

evolution,"Abstract Animal color pattern phenotypes evolve rapidly. What influences their evolution? Because color patterns are used in communication, selection for signal efficacy, relative to the intended receiver's visual system, may explain and predict the direction of evolution. We investigated this in bowerbirds, whose color patterns consist of plumage, bower structure, and ornaments and whose visual displays are presented under predictable visual conditions. We used data on avian vision, environmental conditions, color pattern properties, and an estimate of the bowerbird phylogeny to test hypotheses about evolutionary effects of visual processing. Different components of the color pattern evolve differently. Plumage sexual dimorphism increased and then decreased, while overall (plumage plus bower) visual contrast increased. The use of bowers allows relative crypsis of the bird but increased efficacy of the signal as a whole. Ornaments do not elaborate existing plumage features but instead are innovations (new color schemes) that increase signal efficacy. Isolation between species could be facilitated by plumage but not ornaments, because we observed character displacement only in plumage. Bowerbird color pattern evolution is at least partially predictable from the function of the visual system and from knowledge of different functions of different components of the color patterns. This provides clues to how more constrained visual signaling systems may evolve."
evolution,"Today's information technology society increasingly relies on software at all levels. Nevertheless, software quality generally continues to fall short of expectations, and software systems continue to suffer from symptoms of aging as they are adapted to changing requirements and environments. The only way to overcome or avoid the negative effects of software aging is by placing change and evolution in the center of the software development process. In this article we describe what we believe to be some of the most important research challenges in software evolution. The goal of this document is to provide novel research directions in the software evolution domain."
evolution,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) spreads genetic diversity by moving genes across species boundaries. By rapidly introducing newly evolved genes into existing genomes, HGT circumvents the slow step of ab initio gene creation and accelerates genome innovation. However, HGT can only affect organisms that readily exchange genes (exchange communities). In order to define exchange communities and understand the internal and external environmental factors that regulate HGT, we analyzed approximately 20,000 genes contained in eight free-living prokaryotic genomes. These analyses indicate that HGT occurs among organisms that share similar factors. The most significant are genome size, genome G/C composition, carbon utilization, and oxygen tolerance."
evolution,"Abstract Natural selection has almost certainly shaped many evolutionary trajectories documented in fossil lineages, but it has proven difficult to demonstrate this claim by analyzing sequences of evolutionary changes. In a recently published and particularly promising test case, an evolutionary time series of populations displaying armor reduction in a fossil stickleback lineage could not be consistently distinguished from a null model of neutral drift, despite excellent temporal resolution and an abundance of indirect evidence implicating natural selection. Here, we revisit this case study, applying analyses that differ from standard approaches in that: (1) we do not treat genetic drift as a null model, and instead assess neutral and adaptive explanations on equal footing using the Akaike Information Criterion; and (2) rather than constant directional selection, the adaptive scenario we consider is that of a population ascending a peak on the adaptive landscape, modeled as an Orstein–Uhlenbeck process. For all three skeletal features measured in the stickleback lineage, the adaptive model decisively outperforms neutral evolution, supporting a role for natural selection in the evolution of these traits. These results demonstrate that, at least under favorable circumstances, it is possible to infer in fossil lineages the relationship between evolutionary change and features of the adaptive landscape."
evolution,"Interrelationships of the tapeworms (Platyhelminthes: Cestoda) were examined by use of small (SSU) and large (LSU) subunit ribosomal DNA sequences and morphological characters. Fifty new complete SSU sequences were added to 21 sequences previously determined, and 71 new LSU (D1-D3) sequences were determined for the complementary set of taxa representing each of the major lineages of cestodes as currently understood. New sequences were determined for three amphilinidean taxa, but were removed from both alignments due to their excessively high degree of divergence from other cestode sequences. A morphological character matrix coded for supraspecific taxa was constructed by the modification of matrices from recently published studies. Maximum-parsimony (MP) analyses were performed on the LSU, SSU, LSU+SSU, and morphological data partitions, and minimum-evolution (ME) analyses utilizing a general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution including estimates of among-site rate heterogeneity were performed on the molecular data partitions. Resulting topologies were rooted at the node separating the Gyrocotylidea from the Eucestoda. The LSU data were found to be more informative than the SSU data and were more consistent with inferences from morphology, although nodal support was generally weak for most basal nodes. One class of transitions was found to be saturated for comparisons between the most distantly related taxa (gyrocotylideans vs cyclophyllideans and tetrabothriideans). Differences in the topologies resulting from MP and ME analyses were not statistically significant. Nonstrobilate orders formed the basal lineages of trees resulting from analysis of LSU data and morphology. Difossate orders were basal to tetrafossate orders, the latter of which formed a strongly supported clade. A clade including the orders Cyclophyllidea, Nippotaeniidea, and Tetrabothriidea was supported by all data partitions and methods of analysis. Paraphyly of the orders Pseudophyllidea, Tetraphyllidea, and Trypanorhyncha was consistent among the molecular data partitions. Inferences are made regarding a monozoic (nonsegmented) origin of the Eucestoda as represented by the Caryophyllidea and for the evolution of the strobilate and acetabulate/tetrafossate conditions having evolved in a stepwise pattern."
evolution,"Convergent evolution of similar phenotypic features in similar environmental contexts has long been taken as evidence of adaptation. Nonetheless, recent conceptual and empirical developments in many fields have led to a proliferation of ideas about the relationship between convergence and adaptation. Despite criticism from some systematically minded biologists, I reaffirm that convergence in taxa occupying similar selective environments often is the result of natural selection. However, convergent evolution of a trait in a particular environment can occur for reasons other than selection on that trait in that environment, and species can respond to similar selective pressures by evolving nonconvergent adaptations. For these reasons, studies of convergence should be coupled with other methods—such as direct measurements of selection or investigations of the functional correlates of trait evolution—to test hypotheses of adaptation. The independent acquisition of similar phenotypes by the same genetic or developmental pathway has been suggested as evidence of constraints on adaptation, a view widely repeated as genomic studies have documented phenotypic convergence resulting from change in the same genes, sometimes even by the same mutation. Contrary to some claims, convergence by changes in the same genes is not necessarily evidence of constraint, but rather suggests hypotheses that can test the relative roles of constraint and selection in directing phenotypic evolution."
evolution,"In an asexual population two favorable mutants can be incorporated into the population only if one occurs in a descendant of the individual in which the other occurred. In a sexual population both mutants can be incorporated through recombination. A mathematical formulation is given of the relative rates of incorporation of the new mutations with and without recombination. Recombination is of the greatest advantage when the double mutant is more advantageous than either single mutant, when the mutant effects are small, when mutations occur with high frequency, and when the population is large. On the other hand, for the incorporation of individually deleterious but collectively beneficial mutations, recombination can be disadvantageous. Close linkage has effects similar to those of asexual reproduction. Experimental data on DDT resistance in Drosophila and chloramphenicol resistance in bacteria are cited showing greater development of coadaptation in an asexual system. The evolution of diploidy from haploidy confers an immediate reduction in the mutation load by concealment of deleterious recessives, but this advantage is lost once a new equilibrium is reached. Thus the development of diploidy may be because of an immediate advantage rather than because of any permanent benefit. On the other hand, there are other possible advantages of diploidy, such as heterosis and protection from somatic mutations."
evolution,"***30th Anniversary Edition*** Cover note: Each copy of the anniversary edition of The Blind Watchmaker features a unique biomorph. No two covers are exactly alike. Acclaimed as the most influential work on evolution written in the last hundred years, The Blind Watchmaker offers an inspiring and accessible introduction to one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time. A brilliant and controversial book which demonstrates that evolution by natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind yet essentially non-random process discovered by Darwin - is the only answer to the biggest question of all: why do we exist?"
evolution,"Abstract Mechanisms of speciation are not well understood, despite decades of study. Recent work has focused on how natural and sexual selection cause sexual isolation. Here, we investigate the roles of divergent natural and sexual selection in the evolution of sexual isolation between sympatric species of threespine sticklebacks. We test the importance of morphological and behavioral traits in conferring sexual isolation and examine to what extent these traits have diverged in parallel between multiple, independently evolved species pairs. We use the patterns of evolution in ecological and mating traits to infer the likely nature of selection on sexual isolation. Strong parallel evolution implicates ecologically based divergent natural and/or sexual selection, whereas arbitrary directionality implicates nonecological sexual selection or drift. In multiple pairs we find that sexual isolation arises in the same way: assortative mating on body size and asymmetric isolation due to male nuptial color. Body size and color have diverged in a strongly parallel manner, similar to ecological traits. The data implicate ecologically based divergent natural and sexual selection as engines of speciation in this group."
evolution,"The notion that complexity increases in evolution is widely accepted, but the best‐known evidence is highly impressionistic. Here I propose a scheme for understanding complexity that provides a conceptual basis for objective measurement. The scheme also shows complexity to be a broad term covering four independent types. For each type, I describe some of the measures that have been devised and review the evidence for trends in the maximum and mean. In metazoans as a whole, there is good evidence only for an early‐Phanerozoic trend, and only in one type of complexity. For each of the other types, some trends have been documented, but only in a small number of metazoan subgroups."
evolution,"Natural evolution is a population-based optimization process. Simulating this process on a computer results in stochastic optimization techniques that can often outperform classical methods of optimization when applied to difficult real-world problems. There are currently three main avenues of research in simulated evolution: genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and evolutionary programming. Each method emphasizes a different facet of natural evolution. Genetic algorithms stress chromosomal operators. Evolution strategies emphasize behavioral changes at the level of the individual. Evolutionary programming stresses behavioral change at the level of the species. The development of each of these procedures over the past 35 years is described. Some recent efforts in these areas are reviewed."
evolution,"In this book, Goldschmidt inquires into the types of hereditary differences that produce new species. Goldschmidt used a wide range of research to formulate his own picture of evolution. Contrary to near-unanimity among scientists, he insisted that the neo-Darwinian theory of micromutations applied only within species and was no longer tenable as a general theory of evolution. Instead, Goldschmidt claimed, macroevolution resulted from larger jumps in genotype - across ""bridgeless gaps"" - related either to systemic mutations or to mutations affecting early development."
evolution,"A common observation in phylogenetic comparisons of the amino acid sequences of a particular protein is that the rate of evolution of the protein is nearly constant over extended periods of time. This constancy was first noticed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling (1965) and prompted them to call the amino acid substitution process a ""molecular evolutionary clock."" Since 1965 a great deal of additional data has supported the basic idea of the molecular clock although detailed studies have shown the clock to be a rather erratic one. The detailed studies have been of two different sorts: broadly based statistical studies of a number of proteins over relatively few species (e.g., Langley and Fitch, 1974), or very detailed looks at a particular protein over a large number of species (e.g., Baba et al., 1981). In general, these studies support the crucial observation made by Ohta and Kimura (1971) that the variance in the evolutionary rate is higher than would be expected if the substitution process were a Poisson process. A major goal of theoretical population genetics must be to account for this elevated variance. There are formidable statistical problems associated with the estimation of the variance in the rate of substitutions of amino acids. The problem is compounted by the fact that the variance is only interesting when compared to the mean as in the ratio K = Var(N,)/E(N1), where N, is the number of substitutions in a period of time, t. Obtaining accurate estimates of ratios is difficult in the best of statistical settings. For protein evolution data where the number of substitutions on each leg must themselves be inferred by a procedure such as Fitch and Margoliash's (1967) maximum parsimony procedure, the sampling variance of the final estimate must be relatively high (and itself almost impossible to estimate). Nonetheless, a number of studies have all pointed to a value of K of around 2 to 3. Ohta and Kimura (1971) were the first to estimate K and did so using the available data on hemoglobins and cytochrome c. They reported a value in the range 1.5 to 2.5. The studies by Langley and Fitch (1974) improved on this in the sense of using more data although their procedure was not expressly designed to estimate K. They concluded K was around 2.5. Later, Gillespie and Langley (1979) re-examined the statistical procedure used in the earlier studies and through a very crude argument also claimed that K was around 2.5. In studies that examine only a single protein over a large number of species the aim has been not so much to estimate K as to look more directly for periods of relatively fast or slow evolution in the protein. These studies, such as those by Goodman et al. (1982) generally present fairly convincing evidence of variations in the rates of evolution although Kimura (1981) has called into question the ability of these studies to uncover variation in the rates of evolution. These observations are critical for an understanding of the forces responsible for amino acid substitutions. One of the most appealing theories for the evolution of proteins is the neutral allele theory first proposed by Kimura (1968a, 1968b) and King and Jukes (1969). This theory predicts that the rate of substitutions will be constant although it does not imply that K will equal one as has been commonly assumed. Rather it was shown by Gillespie and Langley (1979) that K will always be greater than one under the neutral allele theory and will actually increase with"
evolution,"First, we shall introduce the materials with which we are dealing, and this requires some understanding of formal names and botanical classification. The taxonomy of cultivated plants has long been in a state of confusion. The same array of variation is treated in radically different ways by different taxonomists (see Jirasek, 1966; Jeffrey, 1968). Classifications are cluttered with Latin names that have little or no biological meaning, and some individual taxa are given ranks ranging from variety to genus depending on who is doing the classifying. Inept classifications have probably caused more difficulty in understanding the origin and evolution of cultivated plants than any other factor. We shall use the gene pool classification suggested by Harlan and de Wet (1971) in order to treat the several cereals on a uniform basis. In this system the total array of variation within maximum genetic reach is partitioned into primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools. The primary gene pool includes all those races that can be crossed with the crop, yielding reasonably fertile hybrids in which the chromosomes pair well and in whose offspring genetic segregation is reasonably normal. The primary gene pool corresponds to the widely accepted concept of the biological species. The secondary gene pool includes all those species that can be crossed with the crop but with restricted gene flow. Genes can be transferred from the secondary to the primary gene pool, but one must struggle with those barriers that separate biological species such as sterility, poor chromosome pairing, lethal or weak hybrids, or poorly adapted hybrid derivatives and so on. The tertiary gene pool includes all those species that can be crossed with the crop, but the hybrids lead essentially nowhere. The hybrids are lethal, completely sterile, or anomalous. If any gene transfer is possible at all, it must be through radical manipulation of some sort such as embryo culture, tissue culture, use of complex hybrid bridges and so on (see Harlan and de Wet, 1971). Polyploid series in cultivated plants pose some special problems. As a general rule, we have suggested (Harlan and de Wet, 1971) that each level be treated as a separate gene pool. The barriers between ploidy levels are not necessarily strong, however, and morphological differences are sometimes minimal and difficult to describe. Each series is different and appropriate treatments must be worked out crop by crop. Separate gene pools for ploidy levels in potato or sugarcane may not be appropriate at all. In the cereals considered here, the only problem of separation by ploidy level occurs in oats where A vena strigosa and A. barbata races are difficult to distinguish morphologically. Our gene pool classification is not intended to be a formal taxonomic system but rather a simple device to bring a genetic focus to bear on the taxonomies already available. The conventional epithets can be used without undue confusion pro-"
evolution,"Two-component signal transduction (TCST) systems are the principal means for coordinating responses to environmental changes in bacteria as well as some plants, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. These systems typically consist of a receptor histidine kinase, which reacts to an extracellular signal by phosphorylating a cytoplasmic response regulator, causing a change in cellular behavior. Although several model systems, including sporulation and chemotaxis, have been extensively studied, the evolutionary relationships between specific TCST systems are not well understood, and the ancestry of the signal transduction components is unclear. Phylogenetic trees of TCST components from 14 complete and 6 partial genomes, containing 183 histidine kinases and 220 response regulators, were constructed using distance methods. The trees showed extensive congruence in the positions of 11 recognizable phylogenetic clusters. Eukaryotic sequences were found almost exclusively in one cluster, which also showed the greatest extent of domain variability in its component proteins, and archaeal sequences mainly formed species-specific clusters. Three clusters in different parts of the kinase tree contained proteins with serine-phosphorylating activity. All kinases were found to be monophyletic with respect to other members of their superfamily, such as type II topoisomerases and Hsp90. Structural analysis further revealed significant similarity to the ATP-binding domain of eukaryotic protein kinases. TCST systems are of bacterial origin and radiated into archaea and eukaryotes by lateral gene transfer. Their components show extensive coevolution, suggesting that recombination has not been a major factor in their differentiation. Although histidine kinase activity is prevalent, serine kinases have evolved multiple times independently within this family, accompanied by a loss of the cognate response regulator(s). The structural and functional similarity between TCST kinases and eukaryotic protein kinases raises the possibility of a distant evolutionary relationship."
evolution,"Abstract The evolution of exploitative specificity can be influenced by environmental variability in space and time and the intensity of trade-offs. Coevolution, the process of reciprocal adaptation in two or more species, can produce variability in host exploitation and as such potentially drive patterns in host and parasite specificity. We employed the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its DNA phage Φ2 to investigate the role of coevolution in the evolution of phage infectivity range and its relation with phage growth rate. At the phage population level, coevolution led to the evolution of broader infectivity range, but without an associated decrease in phage growth rate relative to the ancestor, whereas phage evolution in the absence of bacterial evolution led to an increased growth rate but no increase in infectivity range. In contrast, both selection regimes led to phage adaptation (in terms of growth rates) to their respective bacterial hosts. At the level of individual phage genotypes, coevolution resulted in within-population diversification in generalist and specialist infectivity range types. This pattern was consistent with a multilocus gene-for-gene interaction, further confirmed by an observed cost of broad infectivity range for individual phage. Moreover, coevolution led to the emergence of bacterial genotype by phage genotype interactions in the reduction of bacterial growth rate by phage. Our study demonstrates that the strong reciprocal selective pressures underlying the process of coevolution lead to the emergence and coexistence of different strategies within populations and to specialization between selective environments."
evolution,"Abstract Evolvability is a key characteristic of any evolving system, and the concept of evolvability serves as a unifying theme in a wide range of disciplines related to evolutionary theory. The field of quantitative genetics provides a framework for the exploration of evolvability with the promise to produce insights of global importance. With respect to the quantitative genetics of biological systems, the parameters most relevant to evolvability are the G-matrix, which describes the standing additive genetic variances and covariances for a suite of traits, and the M-matrix, which describes the effects of new mutations on genetic variances and covariances. A population's immediate response to selection is governed by the G-matrix. However, evolvability is also concerned with the ability of mutational processes to produce adaptive variants, and consequently the M-matrix is a crucial quantitative genetic parameter. Here, we explore the evolution of evolvability by using analytical theory and simulation-based models to examine the evolution of the mutational correlation, rμ, the key parameter determining the nature of genetic constraints imposed by M. The model uses a diploid, sexually reproducing population of finite size experiencing stabilizing selection on a two-trait phenotype. We assume that the mutational correlation is a third quantitative trait determined by multiple additive loci. An individual's value of the mutational correlation trait determines the correlation between pleiotropic effects of new alleles when they arise in that individual. Our results show that the mutational correlation, despite the fact that it is not involved directly in the specification of an individual's fitness, does evolve in response to selection on the bivariate phenotype. The mutational variance exhibits a weak tendency to evolve to produce alignment of the M-matrix with the adaptive landscape, but is prone to erratic fluctuations as a consequence of genetic drift. The interpretation of this result is that the evolvability of the population is capable of a response to selection, and whether this response results in an increase or decrease in evolvability depends on the way in which the bivariate phenotypic optimum is expected to move. Interestingly, both analytical and simulation results show that the mutational correlation experiences disruptive selection, with local fitness maxima at –1 and +1. Genetic drift counteracts the tendency for the mutational correlation to persist at these extreme values, however. Our results also show that an evolving M-matrix tends to increase stability of the G-matrix under most circumstances. Previous studies of G-matrix stability, which assume nonevolving M-matrices, consequently may overestimate the level of instability of G relative to what might be expected in natural systems. Overall, our results indicate that evolvability can evolve in natural systems in a way that tends to result in alignment of the G-matrix, the M-matrix, and the adaptive landscape, and that such evolution tends to stabilize the G-matrix over evolutionary time."
evolution,"Because the time parameter in the Schrodinger equation is not observable, energy apparently obeys a superselection rule in the same sense that charge does. That is, observables must all commute with the Hamiltonian and hence be stationary. This means that it is consistent with all observations to assume that any closed system such as the Universe is in a stationary state. We show how the observed dynamic evolution of a system can be described entirely in terms of stationary observables as a dependence upon internal clock readings."
evolution,"Developmental constraints refer to biases that limit phenotypic changes during evolution. To examine the contribution of developmental constraints in the evolution of vertebrate morphology, we analyzed the distribution pattern of mammalian vertebral formulae. Data on mammalian vertebral formulae were collected from the Descriptive Catalogue of the Osteological Series Contained in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England by Richard Owen (1853) and were plotted onto the most reliable mammalian phylogenetic tree based on recent molecular studies. In addition to the number of cervical vertebrae that is almost fixed to 7, we found that the number of thoracolumbar vertebrae tends to be 19 in many groups of mammals. Since fidelity of the number of thoracolumbar vertebrae was also completely maintained in Monotremata and Marsupialia, we presumed that thoracolumbar vertebral number as well as cervical vertebral number might have been fixed in the primitive mammalian lineage. On the basis of primitive vertebral formulae, we could clarify the polarity of evolution and identify several deviations from the primitive states during the mammalian evolution. The changes in the vertebral formulae in eutherian mammals seem to be lineage-specific, such that most species in Carnivora have 20 instead of 19 thoracolumbar vertebrae. Because such lineage-specific vertebral formulae contrast with the estimated distribution pattern on the assumption of evolution only through the selective pressure, we concluded that developmental constraints played an important role in the evolution of mammalian vertebral formulae."

evolution,"Mating system theory is undergoing considerable revision and elaboration (for example: Fisher, 1958; Brown, 1964; Williams, 1966, 1975; Orians, 1969; Cody, 1971; Trivers, 1972; Alexander, 1975; Emlen and Oring, 1977; Alexander and Borgia, 1978). These theories are based upon Darwin's (1871) concept of how natural selection acts within and between the sexes: intrasexual selection, sexual competition between members of the same sex for mates, and intersexual selection, in which one sex is the selective agent for the other. Unfortunately, adequate data to test these theories are lacking for most organisms (but see Bateman, 1948; Savage, 1961; LeBoeuf, 1974; Chagnon, 1974; Jenni, 1974). In this paper, I present necessary data on how mating success varies within and between the sexes to test existing theories of sexual selection for one species, the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, and I extend current theoretical considerations to include how age should influence alternative male mating strategies. Anurans are excellent animals to test theoretical predictions of sexual selection: since males fertilize eggs externally, there is no doubt about male parentage and, thus, relative male mating success. Such high confidence of paternity is lacking for most species with internal fertilization. Additional attributes of bullfrogs which make a study technically possible include (a) a tendency for chorusing males to form relatively dense aggregations thus facili-"
evolution,"Abstract Multihost parasites can infect different types of hosts or even different host species. Epidemiological models have shown the importance of the diversity of potential hosts for understanding the dynamics of infectious disease (e.g., the importance of reservoirs), but the consequences of this diversity for virulence and transmission evolution remain largely overlooked. Here, I present a general theoretical framework for the study of life-history evolution of multihost parasites. This analysis highlights the importance of epidemiology (the relative quality and quantity of different types of infected hosts) and between-trait constraints (both within and between different hosts) to parasite evolution. I illustrate these effects in different transmission scenarios under the simplifying assumption that parasites can infect only two types of hosts. These simple but contrasted evolutionary scenarios yield new insights into virulence evolution and the evolution of transmission routes among different hosts. Because many of the pathogens that have large public-health and agricultural impacts have complex life cycles, an understanding of their evolutionary dynamics could hold substantial benefits for management."
evolution,"Vertebrates are commonly divided into two groups, the ""cold-blooded"" or poikilothermic, and the ""warm-blooded"" or homoiothermic. Unfortunately both the vernacular and technical terms carrv erroneous connotations and moreover imply a dichotomy that does not exist. It is properly assumed that the body temperature of the poikilotherm varies directly with that of the environment. Even though ecologists have long recognized the fact (see Chapman and coauthors, 1926, for example), it is not so generally understood by others that the environment includes not only the air and the substratum, but solar radiation as well, and that animals avail themselves of the great variations in temperature to be found in time and space to avoid extremes and to exercise a measure of control over the thermal level of the body. When confined in the laboratory cage a reptile cannot control its temperature, which may indeed approximate ""that of the surrounding atmosphere"" as stated in many texts. When active under natural conditions it often maintains the body at a thermal level that is higher than that of man and many other mammals. With their elaborate mechanisms to produce heat internally, the birds and mammals are appropriately characterized as endothermic, unlike the reptiles that derive"
evolution,"This research develops an evolutionary growth theory that captures the interplay between the evolution of mankind and economic growth since the emergence of the human species. This unified theory encompasses the observed evolution of population, technology and income per capita in the long transition from an epoch of Malthusian stagnation to sustained economic growth. The theory suggests that prolonged economic stagnation prior to the transition to sustained growth stimulated natural selection that shaped the evolution of the human species, whereas the evolution of the human species was the origin of the take-off from an epoch of stagnation to sustained growth."
gmos,"Misinformation is a serious problem in scientific debates ranging from climate change to vaccines to nuclear power. In this study we quantitatively assess the phenomenon of misinformation - defined as information which is at variance with widely-accepted scientific consensus - on genetically modified crops and food (""GMOs"") in the mainstream and online news media over a two-year period. We found an overall falsehood rate of 9% with a potential readership of 256 million. None of the misinformation was positive in sentiment; most was negative. About a fifth of Africa's media coverage on GMOs contained misinformation, a worrying finding given the potential for genetic engineering to deliver improved nutrition and food security in the continent. We conclude that misinformation about GMOs in the mainstream media is still a significant problem, and outranks the proportion of misinformation in other comparable debates such as COVID-19 and vaccines."

The aim of this two-phase study was to determine how attitudes towards GMOs relate to food choices and how labels indicating the presence or absence of GMOs differentially impact choices among college students—the age group which values transparent food labeling more than any other. Participants (n = 434) made yes/no choices for each of 64 foods. In both phases of the study, participants were randomly assigned to seeing GMO Free labels, contains GMOs labels, or no GMO labels. Across the two phases, 85% of participants reported believing that GMOs were at least somewhat dangerous to health (42% believed GMOs to be dangerous), yet in both studies, although eye-tracking data verified that participants attended to the GMO labels, these labels did not significantly affect food choices. Although college consumers may believe GMOs to be dangerous, their food choices do not reflect this belief."
gmos,"ABSTRACT Since 1996 till 2018, the global area cultivated with GM crops has increased 113-fold, making biotech crops one of the fastest adopted crop technology in the past decades. In the European Union, only two countries still cultivate one available transgenic crop event on minor hectarage. Moreover, the number of notifications for confined field trials has dramatically dropped in the last decade. All these are happening while the EU legislation on GM crops has come under severe criticism. The percentage of EU citizens concerned about the presence of GMOs in the environment has decreased from 30% (in 2002) to 19% (in 2011), while the level of concern about the use of GM ingredients in food or drinks has decreased from 63% (in 2005) to 27% (in 2019). The steadily increasing acceptance of the EU citizens of GMOs in the environment and food, as it was recorded by Eurobarometers, should additionally ease the way and support a positive change of the legal framework that regulates the GM crops’ testing and commercial cultivation in the EU."
gmos,"The food industry is constantly challenged to find new ideas to satisfy the increasingly specific consumer demand. However, innovative food products do not always become part of consumption habits or create a market. One of the major sources of resistance to novelty lies in the attitude of the consumer, who in many cases may be suspicious or hostile as a result of specific ideologies, overly attached to tradition, or affected by neophobia. This paper analyzes the construct of food neophobia (the “unwillingness to try new foods”) in its phenomenology and its actual power to explain hostility to innovation in the agri-food sector. The limits of the concept, which is not always sufficient to shed light on the many reasons that could underlie the rejection of certain foods, will also be discussed. In addition, we review the recent literature on Europeans’ attitude toward novel foods and innovation including Genetically modified organisms (GMOs), cultivated meat and insects as food. This literature reveals a number of paradoxes in consumers’ behavior, and in the many complex conditions underpinning the success of innovation in food production.

The Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project was funded by the European Commission (http://www.gmos.eu) and started in November 2010 with the overall goal to develop a coordinated global observing system to monitor Hg on a global scale, including a large network of ground-based monitoring stations, ad hoc periodic oceanographic cruises and measurement flights in the lower and upper troposphere as well as in the lower stratosphere. To date, more than 40 ground-based monitoring sites constitute the global network covering many regions where little to no observational data were available before GMOS. This work presents atmospheric Hg concentrations recorded worldwide in the framework of the GMOS project (2010-2015), analyzing Hg measurement results in terms of temporal trends, seasonality and comparability within the network. Major findings highlighted in this paper include a clear gradient of Hg concentrations between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, confirming that the gradient observed is mostly driven by local and regional sources, which can be anthropogenic, natural or a combination of both."
gmos,"Population growth, climate change, and increasing human impact on land and aquatic systems all pose significant challenges for current agricultural practices. Genetic engineering is a tool to speed up breeding for new varieties, which can help farmers and agricultural systems adapt to rapidly changing physical growing conditions, technology, and global markets. We review the current scientific literature and present the potential of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) from the perspectives of various stakeholders. GMOs increase yields, lower costs, and reduce the land and environmental footprint of agriculture. The benefits of this technology are shared among innovators, farmers, and consumers. Developing countries and poor farmers gain substantially from GMOs. Agricultural biotechnology is diverse, with many applications having different potential impacts. Its regulation needs to balance benefits and risks for each application. Excessive precaution prevents significant benefits. Increasing access to the technology and avoidance of excessive regulation will allow it to reach its potential."
gmos,"The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) embodies a specific vision of agricultural systems that is highly controversial. The article focuses on how conflicts over GMOs contribute towards food democracy. Food democracy is defined as the possibility for all social groups to participate in, negotiate and struggle over how societies organize agricultural production, thereby ensuring that food systems fulfil the needs of people and sustain (re)productive nature into the future. EU agricultural policy envisages the coexistence of agricultural and food systems with and without GMOs. This policy, which on the surface appears to be a means of avoiding conflict, has in fact exacerbated conflict, while creating obstacles to the development of food democracy. By contrast, empirical analysis of movements against GMOs in Germany and Poland shows how they create pathways towards participation in the food system and the creation of alternative agricultural futures, thereby contributing to a democratization of food systems and thus of society–nature relations. Today, as products of new breeding techniques such as genome editing are being released, these movements are gaining new relevance."
gmos,"Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have caused considerable controversy in China in recent years. Uncertainty about the technology, ineffective channels for releasing official information and a lack of sufficient public trust in the government and scientists have led to rampant rumours about genetic modification technology, making it hard for the public to acquire scientific knowledge about it and a rational attitude towards it. In this paper, by using as an example the rumour that genetically modified (GM) soybeans cause cancer, we discuss the content and diffusion of rumours related to genetic modification technology in the new media environment. Based on an analysis of content on the social media platform Weibo one week after the rumour began, we discovered that the ensuing cyber discussions reflected reality, that netizens expressed anxiety and panic while stressing social injustice and reflecting conflict between social classes, and that they exhibited little trust in scientists and the government. On the mechanism of diffusion of rumours on Weibo, we observed that ‘evidence’ that directly or indirectly purported to show that GM soybeans cause cancer was added to the rumours and that the rumours were ‘assimilated’ into people's perception through the stigmatization of GMOs and through conspiracy theories."
gmos,"The use of nanotechnology (devices/materials composed of parts less than 10 nanometres) in the development of new products is rapidly expanding. Industrialists and decision-makers consider nanotechnology to be the next industrial revolution, but fear they risk the same resistance to nanotechnology that their counterparts experienced with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Although risk perception studies have shown that perceived risk of GMOs is quite high compared to that related to nanotechnology, no study to date has explored a potential direct social representation link between the two. The present study aims to fill that gap by comparing the social representations of nanotechnology and GMOs among a population of non-experts. This study was conducted with 282 students in human and social sciences and natural sciences. Using a free association task with the inductive words ‘nanotechnology’ and ‘GMO (genetically modified organism)’, we identified the existing social representations of the two based on a structural approach. While the representation of GMOs is objectified in the field of agriculture, objectification for nanotechnology seems to still be lacking, although its possible objectification likely lies in computing and robotics. Our calculation of the rate of similarity of associative words with nanotechnology and GMOs indicated no present, direct link between their social representations. We discuss the possible evolution of the social representation of nanotechnology over time."
gmos,"This paper frames genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as invasive species. This offers a way of considering the reception, diffusion and management of GMOs in the foodscape. “An invasive non-native species is any non-native animal or plant that has the ability to spread causing damage to the environment, the economy, our health and the way we live” (NNSS, 2017). Without any social licence, pesticide companies have thrust GMOs into the foodscape. The release of GMOs has generally been unwelcome, there has been no ‘pull’ factor from consumers and there has been vocal resistance from many. The apologists for GMOs have argued the self-contradictory conceit that GMOs are ‘same but different’. Under this logically untenable stance, GMOs are to be excluded from specific regulation because they are the ‘same’ as existing organisms, while simultaneously they are ‘different’ and so open to patenting. GMOs are patented and this demonstrates that, prima facie, these are novel organisms which are non-native to the foodscape. GMO apologists have campaigned intensively, and successfully in USA, to ensure that consumers are kept in the dark and that GMOs remain unlabelled - as a consequence GMOs are ubiquitous in US consumer foods. In contrast, in Australia GMOs are required to be labelled if present in consumer products and, in consequence, Australian food manufacturers do not use them. The release of a GMO calls for biosecurity measures. After trial plots of Monsanto GM canola in Tasmania in the 1990s, the sites continue to be biosecurity monitored for GMO escape, and volunteer canola plants continue to appear two decades later. In Western Australia the escape of GMO canola into a neighbouring organic farm resulted in the loss of organic certification and the monetary loss of the organic premium for produce. GMO produce sells for a 10% discount because of market forces and the consumer aversion to GMOs. Where non-GM product is accidentally contaminated with some GM grain, the whole batch is discounted and is sold as GMO. There is a lack of evidence that GMOs can be contained and many jurisdictions have banned the introduction of GMOs. GMOs have the potential and the propensity to contaminate non-GMO crops and thereby devalue them. The evidence is that GMOs are invasive species, they are unwelcome by consumers, peaceful coexistence with non-GM varieties is a fiction, and GMOs are appropriately managed as a biosecurity issue."
gmos,"The debate over genetically modified organisms: health and safety concerns, environmental impact, and scientific opinions. Since they were introduced to the market in the late 1990s, GMOs (genetically modified organisms, including genetically modified crops), have been subject to a barrage of criticism. Agriculture has welcomed this new technology, but public opposition has been loud and scientific opinion mixed. In GMOs Decoded, Sheldon Krimsky examines the controversies over GMOs-health and safety concerns, environmental issues, the implications for world hunger, and the scientific consensus (or lack of one). He explores the viewpoints of a range of GMO skeptics, from public advocacy groups and nongovernmental organizations to scientists with differing views on risk and environmental impact. Krimsky explains the differences between traditional plant breeding and ""molecular breeding"" through genetic engineering (GE); describes early GMO products, including the infamous Flavr Savr tomato; and discusses herbicide-, disease-, and insect-resistant GE plants. He considers the different American and European approaches to risk assessment, dueling scientific interpretations of plant genetics, and the controversy over labeling GMO products. He analyzes a key 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences on GMO health effects and considers the controversy over biofortified rice (Golden Rice)-which some saw as a humanitarian project and others as an exercise in public relations. Do GMO crops hold promise or peril? By offering an accessible review of the risks and benefits of GMO crops, and a guide to the controversies over them, Krimsky helps readers judge for themselves."

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate knowledge and attitudes toward genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and nanotechnology among the Canadian youth demographic. The primary objective of this pilot study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes toward GMOs and nanotechnology among first year university students. The secondary objective was to compare knowledge and attitudes toward GMOs and nanotechnology among students studying nutrition as to students who do not study nutrition.


Design/methodology/approach
A questionnaire was developed by researchers and student volunteers. This questionnaire was distributed to first year university classes at Western University. The multiple-choice questions were analyzed using SAS, and open-ended questions were analyzed using theme analysis.


Findings
GMO knowledge was strong for both populations, however questions related to the percentage of GM foods grown in Canada indicated nutrition students had a stronger GMO knowledge (p = 0.031). Open-ended questions revealed overall attitudes toward GMOs were either unsure or negative between both populations. Nutrition students had a more positive attitude toward nanotechnology, and a slightly stronger knowledge regarding applications of nanotechnology (p = 0.006). Theme analysis indicated that participants enrolled in nutritional studies were less apprehensive toward GMOs. No differences were indicated in open-ended questions related to nanotechnology between both groups, which may be due to the lack of awareness related to the novelty of the technology.


Research limitations/implications
Without a validated questionnaire, this reduces the reliability of the results from the questionnaire. The questionnaire was carefully designed by combining previous studies questionnaires, as well as producing questions from related literature, which increases the reliability and accuracy of the questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaires underwent several rounds of pre-piloting as well as multiple revisions with current health-care professions to increase the reliability and accuracy of the questionnaire.


Practical implications
This study will assist in understanding the current knowledge of GMOs and nanotechnology among first year university students. This will then allow us to understand if knowledge has a factor in altering students’ attitudes toward these technologies. If students do not have a strong knowledge toward these technologies, then this may lead to the potential implementation of education regarding GMOs and nanotechnology. As these technologies are emerging and being used in everyday food items, individuals should be aware of the implications, as well as the benefits of these technologies.


Originality/value
This is the first study regarding this topic in Canada. Results from this study provide baseline data that may be used to conduct future research.

gmos,"We present the complete optical transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b from 440 to 940 nm at R ∼ 400–1500 obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrometers (GMOS); this is the first result from a comparative exoplanetology survey program of close-in gas giants conducted with GMOS. WASP-4b has an equilibrium temperature of 1700 K and is favorable to study in transmission due to its large scale height (370 km). We derive the transmission spectrum of WASP-4b using four transits observed with the MOS technique. We demonstrate repeatable results across multiple epochs with GMOS, and derive a combined transmission spectrum at a precision about twice above photon noise, which is roughly equal to one atmospheric scale height. The transmission spectrum is well fitted with a uniform opacity as a function of wavelength. The uniform opacity and absence of a Rayleigh slope from molecular hydrogen suggest that the atmosphere is dominated by clouds with condensate grain sizes of ∼1 μm. This result is consistent with previous observations of hot Jupiters since clouds have been seen in planets with similar equilibrium temperatures to WASP-4b. We describe a custom pipeline that we have written to reduce GMOS time-series data of exoplanet transits, and present a thorough analysis of the dominant noise sources in GMOS, which primarily consist of wavelength- and time-dependent displacements of the spectra on the detector, mainly due to a lack of atmospheric dispersion correction."
gmos,"Abstract. The atmospheric deposition of mercury (Hg) occurs via several mechanisms, including dry and wet scavenging by precipitation events. In an effort to understand the atmospheric cycling and seasonal depositional characteristics of Hg, wet deposition samples were collected for approximately 5 years at 17 selected GMOS monitoring sites located in the Northern and Southern hemispheres in the framework of the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project. Total mercury (THg) exhibited annual and seasonal patterns in Hg wet deposition samples. Interannual differences in total wet deposition are mostly linked with precipitation volume, with the greatest deposition flux occurring in the wettest years. This data set provides a new insight into baseline concentrations of THg concentrations in precipitation worldwide, particularly in regions such as the Southern Hemisphere and tropical areas where wet deposition as well as atmospheric Hg species were not investigated before, opening the way for future and additional simultaneous measurements across the GMOS network as well as new findings in future modeling studies."
gmos,"Both cisgenesis and transgenesis are plant breeding techniques that can be used to introduce new genes into plant genomes. However, transgenesis uses gene(s) from a non-plant organism or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the recipient plant while cisgenesis involves the introduction of gene(s) from a crossable—sexually compatible—plant. Traditional breeding techniques could possibly achieve the same results as those from cisgenesis, but would require a much larger timeframe. Cisgenesis allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar more quickly and with little to no genetic drag. The current regulation in the European Union (EU) on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) treats cisgenic plants the same as transgenic plants and both are mandatorily labeled as GMOs. This study estimates European consumers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, cisgenic, with environmental benefits (which cisgenesis could provide), or any combination of these three attributes. Data were collected from 3,002 participants through an online survey administered in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to model consumers’ WTP in each country. Model estimates highlight significant differences in WTP across countries. In all five countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid purchasing rice labeled as GM. In all countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly higher WTP to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM compared to rice labeled as cisgenic, suggesting that inserting genes from the plant’s own gene pool is more acceptable to consumers. Additionally, French consumers are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. These findings suggest that not all GMOs are the same in consumers’ eyes and thus, from a consumer preference perspective, the differences between transgenic and cisgenic products are recommended to be reflected in GMO labeling and trade policies."
gmos,"GMOS-S has been recently upgraded with Hamamatsu deep depletion CCDs, replacing the original EEV detector array. The new CCDs have superior quantum efficiency (QE) at wavelengths longer than 680nm, with significant sensitivity extending beyond 1 micron. Furthermore, the fringing level in GMOS-S data is now much lower due to the much thicker CCDs, additionally improving delivered sensitivity above that afforded by quantum efficiency alone. Soon after the Hamamatsu CCDs were installed in June 2014, some issues were noticed that impacted the ability to execute some science programs. In October 2015 the ARC controller electronics were upgraded and a cable was replaced, and since November 2015 GMOS-S has again been taking science data with the Hamamatsu detectors with no sign of the previous limitations. We present the results of the GMOS-S on-sky commissioning of the Hamamatsu detector array, and provide an update on the status of the GMOS-N portion of the project."
gmos,"Controversy surrounds the production and consumption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Proponents argue that GMO food sources represent the only viable solution to food shortages in an ever-growing global population. Science reports no harm from GMO use and consumption so far. Opponents fear the potentially negative impact that GMO development and use could have on the environment and consumers, and are concerned about the lack of data on the long-term effects of GMO use. We discuss the development of GMO food sources, the history of legislation and policy for the labeling requirements of GMO food products, and the health, environmental, and legal rationale for and against GMO food labeling. The Food and Drug Administration regulates food with GMOs within a coordinated framework of federal agencies. Despite mounting scientific evidence that GMO foods are substantially equivalent to traditionally bred food sources, debate remains over the appropriateness of GMO food labeling. In fact, food manufacturers have mounted a First Amendment challenge against Vermont's passage of a law that requires GMO labeling. Mandatory GMO labeling is not supported by science. Compulsory GMO labels may not only hinder the development of agricultural biotechnology, but may also exacerbate the misconception that GMOs endanger people's health."
gmos,"We present a high-precision mass model of the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.6+ 2223, based on a strong gravitational lensing analysis of Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data and spectroscopic follow-up with Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Our model includes 12 new multiply imaged galaxies, bringing the total to 22, composed of 65 individual lensed images. Unlike the first two HFF clusters, Abell 2744 and MACS J0416.1-2403, MACS J1149 does not reveal as many multiple images in the HFF data. Using the lenstool software package and the new sets of multiple images, we model the cluster with several cluster-scale dark matter haloes and additional galaxy-scale haloes for the cluster members. Consistent with previous analyses, we find the system to be complex, composed of five cluster-scale haloes. Their spatial distribution and lower mass, however, makes MACS J1149 a less powerful lens. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms of 0.91 arcsec. We measure the total projected mass inside a 200-kpc aperture as (1.840 +/- 0.006) x 10(14) M-aS (TM), thus reaching again 1 per cent precision, following our previous HFF analyses of MACS J0416.1-2403 and Abell 2744. In light of the discovery of the first resolved quadruply lensed supernova, SN Refsdal, in one of the multiply imaged galaxies identified in MACS J1149, we use our revised mass model to investigate the time delays and predict the rise of the next image between 2015 November and 2016 January."
gmos,"We present the results of SPT-GMOS, a spectroscopic survey with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South. The targets of SPT-GMOS are galaxy clusters identified in the SPT-SZ survey, a millimeter-wave survey of 2500 deg2 of the southern sky using the South Pole Telescope (SPT). Multi-object spectroscopic observations of 62 SPT-selected galaxy clusters were performed between 2011 January and 2015 December, yielding spectra with radial velocity measurements for 2595 sources. We identify 2243 of these sources as galaxies, and 352 as stars. Of the galaxies, we identify 1579 as members of SPT-SZ galaxy clusters. The primary goal of these observations was to obtain spectra of cluster member galaxies to estimate cluster redshifts and velocity dispersions. We describe the full spectroscopic data set and resulting data products, including galaxy redshifts, cluster redshifts, and velocity dispersions, and measurements of several well-known spectral indices for each galaxy: the equivalent width, W, of [O ii] λλ3727, 3729 and H-δ, and the 4000 Å break strength, D4000. We use the spectral indices to classify galaxies by spectral type (i.e., passive, post-starburst, star-forming), and we match the spectra against photometric catalogs to characterize spectroscopically observed cluster members as a function of brightness (relative to m⋆). Finally, we report several new measurements of redshifts for ten bright, strongly lensed background galaxies in the cores of eight galaxy clusters. Combining the SPT-GMOS data set with previous spectroscopic follow-up of SPT-SZ galaxy clusters results in spectroscopic measurements for >100 clusters, or ∼20% of the full SPT-SZ sample."
gmos,"We have obtained spectra of 163 quasars at zem > 4.4 with the Gemini Multi Object Spectrometers, the largest publicly available sample of high-quality, low-resolution spectra at these redshifts. From this data set, we generated stacked quasar spectra in three redshift intervals at z ∼ 5 to model the average rest-frame Lyman continuum flux and to assess the mean free path λ 912 of the intergalactic medium to H I-ionizing radiation. At mean redshifts zq =(4.56, 4.86, 5.16), we measure λ 912 = (22.2 ± 2.3,15.1 ± 1.8,10.3 ± 1.6) h −1 proper Mpc with uncertainties dominated by sample variance. Combining our results with measurements from lower redshifts, the data are well modelled by a power law λ 912 = A[(1 + z) /5] η with A = (37 ± 2) h −1 Mpc and η =− 5.4 ± 0.4 at 2.3 <z< 5.5. This rapid evolution requires a physical mechanism – beyond cosmological expansion – which reduces the effective Lyman limit opacity. We speculate that the majority of H I Lyman limit opacity manifests in gas outside galactic dark matter haloes, tracing large-scale structures (e.g. filaments) whose average density and neutral fraction decreases with cosmic time. Our measurements of the mean free path shortly after H I reionization serve as a valuable boundary condition for numerical models thereof. Our measured λ 912 ≈ 10 Mpc at z =5.2 confirms that the intergalactic"
gmos,"ABSTRACT This study investigates the role of the discursive process in the act of scientific knowledge building. Specifically, it links scientific knowledge building to risk perception of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). To this end, this study designed and implemented a three-stage argumentation programme giving pre-service teachers (PSTs) the opportunity to consider, discuss and construct shared decisions about GMOs. The study involved 101 third-year PSTs from two different classes, randomly divided into control and experimental groups. The study utilised both quantitative and qualitative methods. During the quantitative phase, researchers administered a pre- and post-intervention scale to measure both groups’ risk perception of GMOs. During the qualitative phase, data were collected from the experimental group alone through individual and group reports and an open-ended questionnaire. T-test results showed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups’ risk perception of GMOs. Qualitative analysis also revealed differences, for example, in PSTs’ weighing of the pros and cons of scientific research demonstrating positive results of GMOs. In addition, PSTs’ acceptance of GMOs increased. Consequently, this study suggests that developing familiarity with scientific enterprise may play an effective role in adopting a scientific perspective as well as a more balanced risk perception of GMOs."

Yet genetically modified bacteria could one day be put to work further afield, as probiotics in our guts to fight gastrointestinal disease or as microscopic janitors to clean up oil spills. But researchers need reliable strategies to keep the synthetic organisms on a tight leash and destroy them when their job is done to prevent them, or their synthetic genes, from escaping uncontrolled into the environment. This year, the field of GMO biocontainment achieved several important advances. In January, teams led by Harvard Medical School’s George M. Church and Yale University’s Farren J.

Within just a few years, as effective laboratory safety rules were established, it became clear that DNA recombinant organisms posed no greater risk than any other biotechnology, including particularly agricultural biotechnology. This evident lack of special risk is what has led biologists and geneticists to make explicit and reiterated requests to political decision‐makers that regulations governing genetically modified organisms should rationally assess the characteristics of the individual product of such genetic manipulation, rather than be based on unfounded fears related to the process of creating recombinant organisms.

> … we have tools and standards to assess the safety of such plant products—whether food or non‐food—and unsatisfactory or dangerous outcomes simply end up in the waste bin…

Are the various techniques for splicing DNA sequences in the genome of existing plant cultivars inherently dangerous, whether the intention is to introduce desirable traits or delete undesirable ones? The answer from almost all individual biologists and scientific societies has been “no”: there is nothing inherently dangerous in these techniques. Of course, the use of any process to improve products can lead to bad results, but bad results are no more likely to result from gene splicing than from any other biotechnology. Moreover, we have tools and standards to assess the safety of such plant products—whether food or non‐food—and unsatisfactory or dangerous outcomes simply end up in the waste bin, and scientists learn from their failures. During the past twenty years, numerous genetically modified cultivars have been discarded before reaching the market owing to unsatisfactory results; the same happened throughout the history of the breeding and domestication of plants and animals. On the other hand, various “events”—so‐called genetically enhanced crops—have been deemed “safe” after careful testing and have …"
gmos,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The debate around the use and study of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is so complex that frequently people miss that the outcome of some political/social/economic decisions are taken in such a way that the legal/agricultural/medical coherence is lost. The purpose of this text is to underline the contradictions in the European approach to GMOs, when for the past 20 years the European Union (EU) has been using and importing GMOs but rejecting its study or cultivation. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The approach follows the distance among public declarations against GMOs from most of the political representatives, followed by decision on our health, nutrition and economic development going exactly in the opposite direction. The arrival of the new genome-edited plants cannot solve all requirements, as in many cases an entire new function should be added and, at present, this will be again a GMO irrespective to the technique used to add a new gene. The delay in taking these decisions are now posing a hazard on the cultural and economic development of the EU. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The laws (directives) on GMOs in the EU are far too restrictive and suffer from an over-regulation that prevent any attempt to come to a science-based approach on genetically modified (GM) plants. The basis for the definition and the restrictions is on the technology and not on the final product. However, on the other hand, the GMOs are the only product where the safety analysis is on the final product (which is not the case for organics productions). The paradox is that all restrictions are concentrated on GM plants to be cultivated in Europe, as if the main hazard would be on the environmental impact of local cultivation. Meanwhile, the EU has no concern if the same environmental damage happens abroad and EU is the final user of the technology as 68 different GMOs are imported and used even for human consumption in Europe. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
Fighting against the EU over-regulation would appear to be a position supporting multinational seed companies (none of them based in the EU), described as polluters. The proposed approach is the opposite, asking for a more restrictive regulation to show to the consumers that: most local EU high quality food products are derived from GM-fed animals; GM cotton is potentially far more risky than any GM food; and reducing GM plants cultivated in Europe increases the pesticide sold by chemical companies (mostly based in the EU)."

gmos,"The paper further contributes to the debate on the use of hybrid and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Nepal by bringing in the concept of seed sovereignty for sustainable agriculture and food security. Moreover, it argues that this debate needs to be looked at from the food system as a whole and at the corporate sector's interest to control the whole food system. The way the concept of 'food sovereignty' was developed to counter the control of the corporate sector on local agricultural production, the concept of 'seed sovereignty' can equally be deployed to save the local genotype, maintain agro-biodiversity and agro-ecology and produce healthy food in an ecologically and climate change-adaptive ways. As the seed is basic to the whole food system, the corporate agricultural sector is precisely hitting at the seed sovereignty of farmers so that they become dependent on them, eventually leading to their monopolistic control over the food system. Therefore, the paper argues that the major concern should be focused on farmers' seed sovereignty as the first step towards sustainable agriculture."
gmos,"Abstract Here, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for 11 common transgenic target DNA in GMOs. Six sets of LAMP primer candidates for each target were designed and their specificity, sensitivity, and reproductivity were evaluated. With the optimized LAMP primers, this LAMP assay was simply run within 45–60 min to detect all these targets in GMOs tested. The sensitivity, specificity, and reproductivity of the LAMP assay were further analyzed in comparison with those of Real-Time PCR. In consistent with real-time PCR, detection of 0.5% GMOs in equivalent background DNA was possible using this LAMP assay for all targets. In comparison with real-time PCR, the LAMP assay showed the same results with simple instruments. Hence, the LAMP assay developed can provide a rapid and simple approach for routine screening as well as specific events detection of many GMOs."
gmos,"Since 2012 the anti-GMO (genetically modified organism) movement has gained significant grassroots momentum in its efforts to require mandatory GMO food labels through state-level ballot and legislative efforts. Major food and agriculture corporations are opposed to mandatory GMO labels and have successfully defeated most of these initiatives. Nevertheless, these battles have garnered significant media attention and re-energized the debate over GMO crops and foods. In this paper, we argue that one of the most significant outcomes of this fight is efforts by food retailers and value-based food companies to implement voluntary non-GMO labels and brands. We draw on the governance and political consumerism literature to explore (counter) movement efforts for mandatory labels and how these efforts are being institutionalized through private voluntary governance institutions. Our assessment is based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with key informants from consumer and environmental organizations, agriculture and biotech companies, and government regulatory agencies, as well as a content analysis of food industry websites. A growing number of food retailers recognize the reputational and economic value that new niche markets for non-GMO foods can offer, while the anti-GMO movement views these efforts as a step in the direction of mandatory GMO labels. We conclude that voluntary labels may act to settle the labeling debate by mollifying agri-food industry concerns about mandatory labeling and meeting the desire of political consumers for greater choice and transparency but without addressing the broader social and environmental sustainability concerns that drives the anti-GMO movement in the first place."

This essay identifies and describes five prominent analytical approaches to explain public controversies over GMOs: the political economy of food and agriculture, social studies on science, democracy theory, research on corporations and hegemony, and social movement and peasant studies. This overview concludes by arguing that these different strains, although each privileging one analytical dimension and one level of analysis, converge in (i) the definition of the relevant explanatory factors, (ii) in the identification of the various levels of analysis – global, transnational, national and local – involved in the issue and (iii) in the prognostic that social disputes over GMOs are likely to remain a topic of public and scholar interest in the near future."
gmos,"Genetically engineered agricultural crops are widely grown for animal feed (yellow corn, soybean meal) and for industrial purposes (such as cotton for fabric, or yellow corn for ethanol), but almost nobody grows GMO food staple crops. The only GMO food staple crop planted anywhere is white maize, and only in one country--the Republic of South Africa. It has been two decades now since GMO crops were first planted commercially, yet it is still not legal anywhere to plant GMO wheat or GMO rice. When it comes to GMO food crops, anti-GMO campaigners have thus won a remarkable yet dubious victory. They have not prevented rich countries from using GMO animal feed or GMO cotton, yet farmers and consumers in poor countries need increased productivity for food crops, not animal feed or industrial crops. Today's de facto global ban on GMO food crops therefore looks suspiciously like an outcome designed by the rich and for the rich, with little regard for the interests of the poor."
gmos,"GMO moratoria are in place in Australia, in some states and not in others. Is co-existence possible between organic farming and GMO farming? And if so, under what circumstances? Australia has more certified organic land than any other country, with a reported 12.0 million hectares of certified organic land compared to the world total of 37.5 million hectares. In a recent court case, an organic farmer lost his organic certification because of GMO contamination. A total of 325 hectares of his 478 hectare farm were contaminated with GM canola blown from a neighbouring property, and this resulted in the decertification of most of the farm. The organic farmer sued his neighbour, a GMO farmer, on the basis of nuisance or negligence, he sought damages for loss of income, and he sought an injunction to rein in his neighbour‟s future GMO farming practices. The case ran before the Supreme Court of Western Australia over three weeks and it generated more than 1000 pages of transcript. The case was dismissed in its entirety, in a 150 page judgment, and is now subject to an appeal. This paper examines the judgment, in the light of the trial transcript of this landmark case, with the view to determining the implications for the future of organic farming and GMO farming, and in particular to ascertain what lessons can be learned from this litigation."
gmos,"This paper seeks to place the divergent approaches of the European Union and United States toward the introduction and marketing of genetically modified (GM) foods and seeds in a broader context. It argues that an important key to understanding why Europe and the United States have chosen to regulate identical technologies in such a dissimilar fashion has to do with recent changes in politics of risk regulation in Europe. From the 1960s through the mid 1980s, the regulation of health, safety and environmental risks was generally stricter in the United States than in Europe. Since the mid 1980s, the obverse has often been the case: a wide array of European consumer and environmental regulations, including those governing GMOs, are now more restrictive than in the United States. In a number of important respects, European regulatory politics and policies over the last fifteen years resemble those of the United States between the late 1960s and the mid 1980s. They are often politicized, highly contentious and characterized by a suspicion of science and a mistrust of both government and industry.

gmos,"Nowadays most animal feed products imported into Europe have a GMO (genetically modified organism) label. This means that they contain European Union (EU)-authorized GMOs. For enforcement of these labeling requirements, it is necessary, with the rising number of EU-authorized GMOs, to perform an increasing number of analyses. In addition to this, it is necessary to test products for the potential presence of EU-unauthorized GMOs. Analysis for EU-authorized and -unauthorized GMOs in animal feed has thus become laborious and expensive. Initial screening steps may reduce the number of GMO identification methods that need to be applied, but with the increasing diversity also screening with GMO elements has become more complex. For the present study, the application of an informative detailed 24-element screening and subsequent identification strategy was applied in 50 animal feed samples. Almost all feed samples were labeled as containing GMO-derived materials. The main goal of the study was therefore to investigate if a detailed screening strategy would reduce the number of subsequent identification analyses. An additional goal was to test the samples in this way for the potential presence of EU-unauthorized GMOs. Finally, to test the robustness of the approach, eight of the samples were tested in a concise interlaboratory study. No significant differences were found between the results of the two laboratories."
gmos,"Most of the farmers are aware of about hybrid seeds; however almost all farmers and even technicians are not quite known about GMOs and associated effects. It is unspoken that use of hybrids has no adverse effect on the environment, human/animal health and our ecosystem if managed properly. Since, Nepal is in a very infant stage in hybrid research and development; however the demand is increasing over time. National legislative mechanism, human resources and physical facilities are not well established in testing and regulation of GMOs. So it is necessary to encourage policy-makers to strengthen their commitment and provide strong policy and financial support to promote hybrid research and development in Nepal through public private partnership for import substitution. Strong regulatory mechanism should be developed and adopted to reduce the inflow of hybrids and regulation of GMOs from abroad. National legislative, administrative and technical competency on research and testing of seed, plants, food, feed and animals with GMOs should be strengthened and regularized along with public participation for making decision whether to allow or restrict the import of the GMOs. Public participation is necessary in the decision making process of production, import, handling and use of GMOs and hybrids. As GMOs are very new and unknown about its implication on human health and the biological diversity, people at all levels should be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of GMOs. As a part of the public awareness program, it is required to disseminate available information on GMOs and products thereof through appropriate media, languages and publications and concerned stakeholders including growers, consumers, and business entrepreneurs.

Officials and staff of the Philippine Department of Agriculture that conduct rice tests for the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) had gathered for a peaceful dialogue. They were taken by surprise when protesters invaded the compound, overwhelmed police and village security, and trampled the rice. Billed as an uprising of farmers, the destruction was actually carried out by protesters trucked in overnight in a dozen jeepneys."
gmos,"This article reviews the approval process of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Japan. The purpose of this review is to explain the Japanese safety approval procedures for food, feed, and imported GMOs and place it in an international context through a comparison with the United States and the European Union (EU). While the regulatory regime in the United States and EU is often discussed, little is understood about the Japanese regulations. However, Japan plays an important role in terms of biotechnological development as well as international trade through agricultural and food imports. Therefore, this article tries to fill the gap in the existing literature. Within Japanese regulations, GMOs are first tested following the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. In a second and final step, compliance with the national laws as well as food and feed safety is assessed. We also summarize the processes used in identity preservation and labeling of approved GMOs. The last section of the article reveals the pragmatic nature of Japanese GMO regulations as compared to the EU and the United States."
gmos,"The centralised authorisation of GMOs in the European Union (EU) has received considerable academic attention in recent years, partly due to the fact thatMember States have not been able to agree on authorisation decisions in the comitology committee. As a consequence, these authorisations are given by the European Commission. These decisions are invariably in favour of authorisation despite the fact that Member States had been divided on this issue. Apart from the on-going discussions on a possible reform of the GMO authorisation (allowing for national restrictions or prohibitions), the new comitology rules brought about by the Lisbon Treaty are of equal importance as they might affect the authorisation of GMOs. In this article we discuss some of the changes to comitology and present empirical material on the first authorisation decisions after the entering into force of the new comitology rules. By drawing on delegation theory we will argue that, for the time being, the level of politicisation ofGMOauthorisation is unlikely to change."
gmos,"Consistent, high-quality measurements of atmospheric mercury (Hg) are necessary in order to better understand Hg emissions, transport, and deposition on a global scale. Although the number of atmospheric Hg monitoring stations has increased in recent years, the available measurement database is limited and there are many regions of the world where measurements have not been extensively performed. Long-term atmospheric Hg monitoring and additional ground-based monitoring sites are needed in order to generate datasets that will offer new insight and information about the global scale trends of atmospheric Hg emissions and deposition. In the framework of the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project, a coordinated global observational network for atmospheric Hg is being established. The overall research strategy of GMOS is to develop a state-of-the-art observation system able to provide information on the concentration of Hg species in ambient air and precipitation on the global scale. This network is being developed by integrating previously established ground-based atmospheric Hg monitoring stations with newly established GMOS sites that are located both at high altitude and sea level locations, as well as in climatically diverse regions. Through the collection of consistent, high-quality atmospheric Hg measurement data, we seek to create a comprehensive assessment of atmospheric Hg concentrations and their dependence on meteorology, long-range atmospheric transport and atmospheric emissions."
gmos,"Regulating risks in the face of scientific uncertainty poses a particular challenge to policy-makers. Such problems are amplified when decisions are taken in a multi-level framework of supranational governance. The genetically modified organism (GMO) regulation in the European Union constitutes an especially salient issue of risk governance in a multi-lateral arena, as the topic is politically highly visible and decision-making is slow and contested. Furthermore, as authority is dispersed among multiple actors, European risk governance is in need of adequate mechanisms ensuring that decision-makers justify and account for their behavior. While legitimacy aspects of GMO governance have widely been examined, accountability relations within the field of GMO risk governance have hitherto only weakly been explored. Hence, this paper analyzes the question of who can be held accountable under the complex system of supranational risk governance. This paper claims that mere adherence by actors to the regulatory procedures during the decision-making process does not necessarily imply that overall accountability can be secured, resulting in ‘organized irresponsibility’. Although certain piecemeal accountability may exist, establishing overall accountability is complicated, precisely as a result of the complex system of interwoven rules."
gmos,"People have been altering the genomes of plants and animals for many years using traditional breeding techniques. Artificial selection for specific, desired traits has resulted in a variety of different organisms, ranging from sweet corn to hairless cats. But this artificial selection, in which organisms that exhibit specific traits are chosen to breed subsequent generations, has been limited to naturally occurring variations. In recent decades, however, advances in the field of genetic engineering have allowed for precise control over the genetic changes introduced into an organism. Today, we can incorporate new genes from one species into a completely unrelated species through genetic engineering, optimizing agricultural performance or facilitating the production of valuable pharmaceutical substances. Crop plants, farm animals, and soil bacteria are some of the more prominent examples of organisms that have been subject to genetic engineering."
gmos,"The fate of dietary DNA in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of animals has gained renewed interest after the commercial introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMO). Among the concerns regarding GM food, are the possible consequences of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of recombinant dietary DNA to bacteria or animal cells. The exposure of the GIT to dietary DNA is related to the extent of food processing, food composition, and to the level of intake. Animal feeding studies have demonstrated that a minor amount of fragmented dietary DNA may resist the digestive process. Mammals have been shown to take up dietary DNA from the GIT, but stable integration and expression of internalized DNA has not been demonstrated. Despite the ability of several bacterial species to acquire external DNA by natural transformation, in vivo transfer of dietary DNA to bacteria in the intestine has not been detected in the few experimental studies conducted so far. However, major methodological limitations and knowledge gaps of the mechanistic aspects of HGT calls for methodological improvements and further studies to understand the fate of various types of dietary DNA in the GIT."
gmos,"Biotechnology in the recent years has emerged as a powerful medium for socio-economic development. A wide array of biotechnological techniques is being developed. Genetically modified crops and genetically modified animals are one of such example in which biotechnology has played a key role. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are the organisms whose genetic material (DNA) has been modified through unnatural means. This technology is referred to as “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or the “genetic engineering”. This technology has been used to transfer selected genes from one organism to another organism. This technique has been used around many countries of the world for creating GM crops. However, such developments have resulted in the opening of multiple moral, legal and health issues as discussed in the review. While using such organisms, these issues need to be considered. Whereas considering the advantages, the disadvantages and the downsides are to be realized. Many countries have experienced different challenges while using the genetically modified organism. Currently, USA is considered to be the biggest producer and user of GMOs, whereas the European Union has had few reservations on their use. One common example of GMOs is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton. The only GM crop commercialized in Pakistan is Bt Cotton. There have been few controversies associated with the use of GMOs in Pakistan which are discussed. This review predominantly considers the effect of GMOs on the agricultural production of the world in general and that of Pakistan in particular, presenting balanced views on its benefits and its certain ill effects. This review also covers the conventions and protocols relating to GMOs and its current status in Pakistan, and also highlights an alternate to GMOs in the form of synthetic biology which helps in the synthesis of new genes without the donor organism."

gmos,"j INTRODUCTION Public concerns about new technologies like genetically modi ed organisms (GMOs) have occasioned recognition of a crisis of public con dence in science in late-modern society (UK House of Lords, 2000; CEC, 2000). The long-held belief on the part of promoters of such technologies that the public’s unwillingness to comply with scienti c prescriptions is due to public ignorance and media irresponsibility, has been falsi ed by copious evidence and experience (which is not to say that these conditions do not exist). Nevertheless, the key insight continues to be systematically overlooked—namely, that sceptical public reactions are not reactions to (supposedly misperceived) risks as such, or to media representations of these, but rather are public judgements of dominant scienti c and policy institutions and their behaviours, including their representations of the public (Wynne, 1980, 1989). This alternative understanding of the basic forces and responsibilities underlying public responses recognizes that they have intellectual substance, which of course is always fallible and arguable, yet their intellectual substance does not correspond with institutional expert categories, since it goes much deeper than simply ‘disagreeing with’ or ‘rejecting’ expert views. Conventional approaches, on the other hand, reproduce long-standing, deeply cultural presumptions of a categorical divide between factual, objective and real knowledge on the one hand, and cognitively empty emotion or values on the other; and that whilst science looks after the former, lay publics are only capable of taking sentimental, emotional and intellectually vacuous positions."
gmos,"Risk assessment is a procedure normally carried out prior to decision-making on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. Most countries dealing with the release of GMOs have appropriate guidelines. The objectives of this paper are to critically examine the risk assessment provisions of the Malaysian Biosafety Act (2007), and to compare it with several risk assessment provisions in the Cartagena Protocol, as well as regulations in developed countries. There are inadequacies in the risk assessment provisions of the Malaysian Biosafety Act (2007 Act), compared to those of the Cartagena Protocol, as well as those found in European Commission Directives. Although the central objective of the 2007 Act was similar to the Cartagena Protocol, the Act was found to be very basic with only a brief provision on risk assessment and there is no specific coverage on the socio-economic and ethical aspects as well as the precautionary approach. It is hoped that these inadequacies will be improved upon, in order to bring the Malaysian Biosafety Act closer to the level seen in the biosafety laws of more developed countries and to ensure adequate level of protection for the Malaysian people against any adverse effects of GMOs and products."
gmos,"This paper presents deep high quality photometry of globular cluster (GC) systems belonging to five early-type galaxies covering a range of mass and en vironment. Photometric data were obtained with the Gemini North and Gemini South telescopes in the filter passbands g ′ , r ′ , and i ′ . The combination of these filters with good seeing condition s allows an excellent separation between GC candidates and unresolved field o bjects. In fact, our previously published spectroscopic data indicates a contamination level of only �10 percent in our sample of GC candidates. Bimodal GC colour distributions are found in all five galaxies. Most of the GC systems appear bimodal even in the (g ′ -r ′ ) vs (r ′ -i ′ ) plane. A population of resolved/marginally resolved GC and Ultra Compact Dwarf candidates was found in all the galaxies. A search for the so-called “blue tilt” in the colou r-magnitude diagrams reveals that NGC 4649 clearly shows that phenomenon although no conclusive evidence was found for the other galaxies in the sample. This “blue tilt” translate s into a mass-metallicity relation given by Z / M 0.28±0.03 . This dependence was found using a new empirical (g ′ -i ′ ) vs [Z/H] relation which relies on an homogeneous sample of GC colours and metallicities. This paper also explores the radial trends in both colour and surface density for the blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) GC subpopulations. As usual, the red GCs show a steeper radial distribution than the blue ones. Evidence of galactocentric colour gradients is found in some of the GC systems, being more significant for the two S0 galaxies in the sample. Red GC subpopulations show similar colours and gradients to the galaxy halo stars in their inner region. A GC mean colour-galaxy luminosity relation, consistent with [Z/H]/ LB 0.26±0.08 , is present for the red GCs. An estimate of the total GC populations and specific freq uency SN values is presented for NGC 3115, NGC 3923 and NGC 4649."
gmos,"We summarize the major points of international debate on health risk studies for the main commercialized edible GMOs. These GMOs are soy, maize and oilseed rape designed to contain new pesticide residues since they have been modified to be herbicide-tolerant (mostly to Roundup) or to produce mutated Bt toxins. The debated alimentary chronic risks may come from unpredictable insertional mutagenesis effects, metabolic effects, or from the new pesticide residues. The most detailed regulatory tests on the GMOs are three-month long feeding trials of laboratory rats, which are biochemically assessed. The tests are not compulsory, and are not independently conducted. The test data and the corresponding results are kept in secret by the companies. Our previous analyses of regulatory raw data at these levels, taking the representative examples of three GM maize NK 603, MON 810, and MON 863 led us to conclude that hepatorenal toxicities were possible, and that longer testing was necessary. Our study was criticized by the company developing the GMOs in question and the regulatory bodies, mainly on the divergent biological interpretations of statistically significant biochemical and physiological effects. We present the scientific reasons for the crucially different biological interpretations and also highlight the shortcomings in the experimental protocols designed by the company. The debate implies an enormous responsibility towards public health and is essential due to nonexistent traceability or epidemiological studies in the GMO-producing countries."
gmos,"In the midst of the European Union (EU) genetically modified organisms (GMOs) regime, coexistence of GM and non-GM crops alongside each other remains technically within the competence of the Member States. Post EU authorization of a GM crop, Member States may legally take appropriate measures to limit or prevent the presence of GMOs within non-GM crops. In July 2010, as part of a Cultivation Package, the Commission created a new Coexistence Recommendation that supports a flexible approach to more stringent coexistence measures by the States, while attempting to maintain control over the legitimate objectives justifying the measures. This article analyzes the impact of the 2010 Recommendation upon coexistence in the context of the existing practices and the previous 2003 Recommendation, taking into account its status as a soft law document and the 'domino effect'. It is argued that the 2010 Recommendation may have greater practical and legal ramifications for coexistence than might first be thought. In attempting to create guidelines that allow a more flexible and inclusive approach towards national measures, the 2010 Recommendation may act as a catalyst to eventually exclude GM cultivation within Member States."
gmos,"Abstract The European Union has emerged as the global precautionary superpower, particularly in the field of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The EU has moved away from the initial World Trade Organization (WTO) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) consensus and shifted toward strict safety assessment and mandatory labelling. In addition, the pathway to this change has been beset with incoherence and a series of crises. What explains this move toward tight regulation despite enduring economic interests to do otherwise? This paper uses the framework of competitive governance to analyse this outcome. The high degree of politicization of the GMO issue has made it a key battleground for competition for leadership, particularly between the Commission and the Council of Ministers. The result has been a protracted battle over agenda setting and issue framing and a cycle of competitive regulatory reinforcement. The Council has used its leverage in comitology to shape the legislative agenda and push the outcome toward its political preferences. The paper unpacks both the steps and incoherence in GMO governance since 1995 and the relationships between key actors involved."
gmos,"In May 2003, the United States, Canada and Argentina launched a World Trade Organization (WTO) case against the European Union concerning its authorization regime for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The complainants challenged three types of measures: (i) an alleged general moratorium on the approval of GMOs; (ii) delays in the processing of product-specific applications; (iii) national safeguard measures adopted by certain Member States banning the marketing of certain genetically modified products. In November 2006, the WTO condemned the European regime. Using the most recent advances in gravity equation, we estimate the reduction in exports of potentially affected products from the complainants to the European Union. Export losses are calculated by product, complainant country and measure at stake. Our results tend to confirm the foundations of the dispute: the European moratorium and product-specific measures have a negative effect on trade, as do safeguard measures adopted by Germany, Italy and Greece."
gmos,"Chronic health effects are increasing in the world such as cancers, hormonal, reproductive, nervous, or immune diseases, even in young people. During regulatory toxicological subchronic tests to prevent these on mammalian health, prior commercialization of chemicals, including pesticides and drugs, or GMOs, some statistically significant findings may be revealed. This discussion is about the need to investigate the relevant criteria to consider those as biologically significant. The sex differences and the non linear dose or time related effects should be considered in contrast to the claims of a Monsanto-supported expert panel about a GMO, the MON 863 Bt maize, but also for pesticides or drugs, in particular to reveal hormone-dependent diseases and first signs of toxicities."
gmos,"We present results from a spectroscopic program targeting 26 strong-lensing cluster cores that were visually identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2). The 26 galaxy cluster lenses span a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 0.65, and our spectroscopy reveals 69 unique background sources with redshifts as high as z = 5.200. We also identify redshifts for 262 cluster member galaxies and measure the velocity dispersions and dynamical masses for 18 clusters where we have redshifts for N ⩾ 10 cluster member galaxies. We account for the expected biases in dynamical masses of strong-lensing-selected clusters as predicted by results from numerical simulations and discuss possible sources of bias in our observations. The median dynamical mass of the 18 clusters with N ⩾ 10 spectroscopic cluster members is MVir = 7.84 × 1014 M☉ h−10.7, which is somewhat higher than predictions for strong-lensing-selected clusters in simulations. The disagreement is not significant considering the large uncertainty in our dynamical data, systematic uncertainties in the velocity dispersion calibration, and limitations of the theoretical modeling. Nevertheless our study represents an important first step toward characterizing large samples of clusters that are identified in a systematic way as systems exhibiting dramatic strong-lensing features."
gmos,"We report on deep imaging of a remote M31 globular cluster, MGC1, obtained with Gemini/GMOS. Our colour-magnitude diagram for this object extends ∼5 mag below the tip of the red-giant branch and exhibits features consistent with an ancient metal-poor stellar population, including a long, well-populated horizontal branch. The red-giant branch locus suggests MGC1 has a metal abundance [M/H] ≈ ―2.3. We measure the distance to MGC1 and find that it lies ∼160 kpc in front of M31 with a distance modulus μ = 23.95 ± 0.06. Combined with its large projected separation of R p = 117 kpc from M31, this implies a deprojected radius of R gc = 200 ± 20 kpc, rendering it the most isolated known globular cluster in the Local Group by some considerable margin. We construct a radial brightness profile for MGC and show that it is both centrally compact and rather luminous, with M V = -9.2. Remarkably, the cluster profile shows no evidence for a tidal limit and we are able to trace it to a radius of at least 450 pc, and possibly as far as ∼900 pc. The profile exhibits a power-law fall-off with exponent γ = ―2.5, breaking to γ = ―3.5 in its outermost parts. This core-halo structure is broadly consistent with expectations derived from numerical models, and suggests that MGC1 has spent many gigayears in isolation."
gmos,"We have carried out a narrow-band survey of the Local Group galaxy, M33, in the HeII λ4686 emission line, to identify HeII nebulae in this galaxy. With spectroscopic follow-up observations, we confirm three of seven candidate objects, including identification of two new HeII nebulae, BCLMP651, HBW673. We also obtain spectra of associated ionizing stars for all the HII regions, identifying two new WN stars. We demonstrate that the ionizing source for the known HeII nebula, MA 1, is consistent with being the earlytype WN star MC8 (M33-WR14), by carrying out a combined stellar and nebular analysis of MC8 and MA 1. We were unable to identify the helium ionizing sources for HBW 673 and BCLMP 651, which do not appear to be Wolf-Rayet stars. According to the [OIII]λ5007/Hβ vs. [NII]λ6584/Hα diagnostic diagram, excitation mechanisms apart from hot stellar continuum are needed to account for the nebular emission in HBW 673, which appears to have no stellar source at all."
gmos,"The objective of this study was to investigate knowledge about, opinions on and attitudes toward and finally readiness to accept genetically modified organisms (GMO) among Slovenian teachers. On average, they have higher levels of knowledge in classical genetics, and poor levels of knowledge about modern issues in biotechnology, and their attitudes toward GMOs are not extreme. They make decisions based on the acceptability of a particular GMO and not on GMOs in general, following two patterns: genetic modifications (GM) microorganisms and plants are more acceptable than animals, and GMOs are more acceptable if they can not be used directly for consumption and produce something recognized as useful. The relationship among knowledge of, attitudes towards and readiness to accept GMO showed that there is no correlation between knowledge and attitudes, only a weak correlation between knowledge and acceptance, and a solid correlation between attitudes and readiness to accept GMO. The practical implication of our findings is that acceptance of GMOs will not be changed by providing new technical or scientific information to teachers but by changing attitudes. The appropriate strategies and actions for improving university courses in biotechnology and the implication for classroom science activities and future research are discussed."
gmos,"This opinion proposes: 1) updated statistical guidelines and possible approaches for the analysis of compositional, agronomic and phenotypic data from field trials carried out for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived foods/feeds; 2) minimum requirements that should be met in the experimental design of field trials, such as the inclusion of commercial varieties, in order to ensure sufficient statistical power and reliable estimation of natural variability. A graphical representation is proposed to allow the comparison of the GMO, its conventional counterpart and the commercial varieties with respect to many variables, taking into account natural variability. It is recommended to quantify natural variability from data on non-GM commercial varieties treated in the same way and in the same experiments as the GM and the conventional counterpart test materials. Only when such estimates are unavailable may they be estimated from databases or literature. Estimated natural variability should be used to specify equivalence limits to test the difference between the GMO and the commercial varieties. Adjustments to these equivalence limits allow a simple graphical representation so that a single pair of confidence limits may be used to display statistically significant differences and to visually assess equivalence. The possible types of outcome of this graphical representation are described and a proposal is made when further evaluation should be performed. In addition to providing specific recommendations for the interpretation of compositional analysis, this opinion highlights some statistical issues of a more challenging nature, such as the simultaneous assessment of many characteristics (i.e. multivariate analysis), which will require further research. The principles proposed in this opinion may be used, in certain cases, for the evaluation of GMOs other than plants."
gmos,"This article contributes to the current debate on the meaning and regulation of biotechnology by focusing on the role that the concepts of nature and sound science play in framing struggles against agricultural biotechnology in India. It contends that the political work of these concepts consists of limiting democratic deliberation by neatly separating facts from values and scientific certainty from politics. In particular, it aims to show that both the invocation of nature and reliance on sound science are counterproductive for the more interesting challenges opponents are already articulating outside the boundaries drawn by the nature/society, science/politics and facts/ values distinctions. Indeed, the political significance of the collective experimentations going on in India (as elsewhere) is that they signal a shift from a risk mentality, centred on ‘hard facts’ supposed to settle the debate, to novel approaches to uncertainty that recognize the increasing controversies surrounding GMOs. These approaches, it is argued, provide a more interesting space for thinking about the uncertainty surrounding biotechnological crops and the relations we (might) share with them."

gmos,"A continuous viable research used to develop living modified organisms/genetically modified organisms (LMOs/GMOs) by biotechnologists around the world is a sine qua non for providing subsistence to the ever growing populations in developing and least developed countries because they will continually experience rise in population till 2050. Moreover, it is necessary that all LMOs/GMOs are safe for human consumption and compatible with the environment; thus, they should save lives instead of taking lives by being spurious. This requires restraint on self-interests, economic and personal interests on the part of the developers of LMOs/GMOs, especially biotechnologists, companies engaged with biotechnology researches and governments. As a matter of fact, all LMOs/GMOs must pass through an intensive risk assessment provided in certain international legal instruments before they are allowed to be marketed for human consumption or introduced into the environment. So far international trade in LMOs/GMOs is concerned, it is the duty of the exporting as well as importing countries to perform universally acclaimed lab and field testing in order to ensure their safety to human health and to be environmentally friendly so that sustainability imperatives are adhered to. This study discusses ways and means to achieve these imperatives in the light of relevant international laws, and it offers certain amicable suggestions for ensuring pubic interests. Key words: LMOs, GMOs, traditional knowledge, geographical indication, environment, international trade."
gmos,"The cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops has seen a rapid growth since 1996, especially in North and South America. In the European Union (EU) the cultivation of GM crops is still rather limited. In contrast, the use of GM crops in the EU is rapidly increasing. Over the last years there have been increasing difficulties with the EU import of (GM) food and feedstuffs from major exporting countries. This is caused by the asynchronous EU approval of GM crops, coupled with the operation of a zero tolerance threshold for the presence of GMOs not yet approved in the EU. This policy of the EU has already led to difficulties with the import of raw materials from exporting countries where more GMOs have already been approved or are under development. This report argues that it is likely that in the near future problems will become more urgent. This could negatively affect the EU supply of raw materials and economic position of the European agricultural and food sector."
gmos,"This study reports on a survey of Millennials in the USA regarding GMO foods. Potential benefits of GMO food crops include improving agricultural productivity, such as insect-resistant and drought-resistant crops, and alleviating world hunger, particularly in developing countries. Scientific research fully supports the health and safety of GMO foods. However, opponents to GMO foods still exist, some motivated by economic self-interest and others by fear of science and technology. The debate over GMO foods is widely considered the single-biggest issue facing modern agriculture, characterised as a clash between pro-science and anti-science forces, the outcome having ramifications extending far beyond agriculture and GMOs. To effectively market GMO foods to Millennials and others, agricultural producers, distributors, and food retailers will need to educate consumers about the overwhelming scientific support for the health benefits and safety of GMO foods."
gmos,"Prominent scientists and policymakers assert with confidence that there is no scientific controversy over the health effects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)—that genetically modified crops currently in commercial use and those yet to be commercialized are inherently safe for human consumption and do not have to be tested. Those who disagree are cast as “GMO deniers.” This article examines scientific reviews and papers on GMOs, compares the findings of professional societies, and discusses the treatment of scientists who have reported adverse effects in animal feeding experiments. This article concludes by exploring the role that politics and corporate interests have had in distorting an honest inquiry into the health effects of GMO crops."
gmos,"Summary Conservative distrust of scientists regarding climate change and evolution has been widely expressed in public pronouncements and surveys, contributing to impressions that conservatives are less likely to trust scientists in general. But what about other topics, where some liberals have expressed misgivings too? Nuclear power safety, vaccinations, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are three often-mentioned examples. For this report, five similarly worded survey questions were designed to test the hypothesis that, depending on the issue, liberals are just as likely to reject science as conservatives. The five questions were included along with many unrelated items in telephone surveys of over 1,000 New Hampshire residents."
gmos,"Cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their use in food and feed is constantly expanding; thus, the question of informing consumers about their presence in food has proven of significant interest. The development of sensitive, rapid, robust, and reliable methods for the detection of GMOs is crucial for proper food labeling. In response, we have experimentally characterized the helicase-dependent isothermal amplification (HDA) and sequence-specific detection of a transgene from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S Promoter (CaMV35S), inserted into most transgenic plants. HDA is one of the simplest approaches for DNA amplification, emulating the bacterial replication machinery, and resembling PCR but under isothermal conditions. However, it usually suffers from a lack of selectivity, which is due to the accumulation of spurious amplification products. To improve the selectivity of HDA, which makes the detection of amplification products more reliable, we have developed an electrochemical platform targeting the central sequence of HDA copies of the transgene. A binary monolayer architecture is built onto a thin gold film where, upon the formation of perfect nucleic acid duplexes with the amplification products, these are enzyme-labeled and electrochemically transduced. The resulting combined system increases genosensor detectability up to 10(6)-fold, allowing Yes/No detection of GMOs with a limit of detection of ∼30 copies of the CaMV35S genomic DNA. A set of general utility rules in the design of genosensors for detection of HDA amplicons, which may assist in the development of point-of-care tests, is also included. The method provides a versatile tool for detecting nucleic acids with extremely low abundance not only for food safety control but also in the diagnostics and environmental control areas."
gmos,"As long as the genetically modified crops are gaining attention globally, their proper approval and commercialization need accurate and reliable diagnostic methods for the transgenic content. These diagnostic techniques are mainly divided into two major groups, i.e., identification of transgenic (1) DNA and (2) proteins from GMOs and their products. Conventional methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were routinely employed for DNA and protein based quantification respectively. Although, these Techniques (PCR and ELISA) are considered as significantly convenient and productive, but there is need for more advance technologies that allow for high throughput detection and the quantification of GM event as the production of more complex GMO is increasing day by day. Therefore, recent approaches like microarray, capillary gel electrophoresis, digital PCR and next generation sequencing are more promising due to their accuracy and precise detection of transgenic contents. The present article is a brief comparative study of all such detection techniques on the basis of their advent, feasibility, accuracy, and cost effectiveness. However, these emerging technologies have a lot to do with detection of a specific event, contamination of different events and determination of fusion as well as stacked gene protein are the critical issues to be addressed in future."
gmos,"Quickness, simplicity, and effectiveness are the three major criteria for establishing a good molecular diagnosis method in many fields. Herein we report a novel detection system for genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which can be utilized to perform both on-field quick screening and routine laboratory diagnosis. In this system, a newly designed inexpensive DNA extraction device was used in combination with a modified visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (vLAMP) assay. The main parts of the DNA extraction device included a silica gel membrane filtration column and a modified syringe. The DNA extraction device could be easily operated without using other laboratory instruments, making it applicable to an on-field GMO test. High-quality genomic DNA (gDNA) suitable for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal amplification could be quickly isolated from plant tissues using this device within 15 min. In the modified vLAMP assay, a microcrystalline wax encapsulated detection bead containing SYBR green fluorescent dye was introduced to avoid dye inhibition and cross-contaminations from post-LAMP operation. The system was successfully applied and validated in screening and identification of GM rice, soybean, and maize samples collected from both field testing and the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) proficiency test program, which demonstrated that it was well-adapted to both on-field testing and/or routine laboratory analysis of GMOs."

gmos,"As the worldwide commercialization of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) increases and consumers concern the safety of GMOs, many countries and regions are issuing labeling regulations on GMOs and their products. Analytical methods and their standardization for GM ingredients in foods and feed are essential for the implementation of labeling regulations. To date, the GMO testing methods are mainly based on the inserted DNA sequences and newly produced proteins in GMOs. This paper presents an overview of GMO testing methods as well as their standardization."
gmos,"A rapid, reliable, and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) system was developed for screening of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The optimized LAMP assays using designed primers target commonly employed promoters, i.e., Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (P-35S) and Figwort Mosaic Virus promoter (P-FMV), and marker genes, i.e., aminoglycoside 3'-adenyltransferase (aadA), neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII), and β-glucuronidase (uidA). The specificity and performance of the end-point and real-time LAMP assays were confirmed using eight genetically modified (GM) cotton events on four detection systems, employing two chemistries. LAMP assays on the isothermal real-time system were found to be most sensitive, detecting up to four target copies, within 35 min. The LAMP assays herein presented using alternate detection systems can be effectively utilized for rapid and cost-effective screening of the GM status of a sample, irrespective of the crop species or GM trait. These assays coupled with a fast and simple DNA extraction method may further facilitate on-site GMO screening."
gmos,"As genetically modified (GM) technology develops and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) become more available, GMOs face increasing regulations and pressure to adhere to strict labeling guidelines. A singleplex detection method cannot perform the high-throughput analysis necessary for optimal GMO detection. Combining the advantages of multiplex detection and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), a single universal primer-multiplex-ddPCR (SUP-M-ddPCR) strategy was proposed for accurate broad-spectrum screening and quantification. The SUP increases efficiency of the primers in PCR and plays an important role in establishing a high-throughput, multiplex detection method. Emerging ddPCR technology has been used for accurate quantification of nucleic acid molecules without a standard curve. Using maize as a reference point, four heterologous sequences ( 35S, NOS, NPTII, and PAT) were selected to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of this strategy. Surprisingly, these four genes cover more than 93% of the transgenic maize lines and serve as preliminary screening sequences. All screening probes were labeled with FAM fluorescence, which allows the signals from the samples with GMO content and those without to be easily differentiated. This fiveplex screening method is a new development in GMO screening. Utilizing an optimal amplification assay, the specificity, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were validated. The LOD and LOQ of this GMO screening method were 0.1% and 0.01%, respectively, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) < 25%. This method could serve as an important tool for the detection of GM maize from different processed, commercially available products. Further, this screening method could be applied to other fields that require reliable and sensitive detection of DNA targets."
gmos,"This article discusses a previously unrecognized avenue for bioterrorism and biocrime. It is suggested that new gene editing technologies may have the potential to create plants that are genetically modified in harmful ways, either in terms of their effect on the plant itself or in terms of harming those who would consume foods produced by that plant. While several risk scenarios involving GMOs—such as antibiotic resistant pathogens, synthetic biology, or mixing of non-GMO seeds with GMO seeds—have previously have been recognized, the new vulnerability is rooted in a different paradigm—that of clandestinely manipulating GMOs to create damage. The ability to actively inflict diseases on plants would pose serious health hazards to both humans and animals, have detrimental consequences to the economy, and directly threaten the food supply. As this is the first study of this kind, the full scope and impact of suck attacks—especially those involving the intended misuse of technologies such as gene-drives—merits further investigation. Herein, the plausibility of some of the new risks will be analyzed by, (1) Highlighting ownership and origination issues (esp. of event-specific GM-plants) as unrecognized risk factors; (2) Investigating the unique role of GMOs, why—and how—certified GMOs could become a new venue for such attacks; (3) Analyzing possible dual-use potentials of modern technologies and research oriented toward the advancement of GMOs, plant breeding and crop improvement. The identification and analysis of harmful genetic manipulations to utilize (covertly modified) plants (GMOs and non-GMOs) as an attack vector show that these concerns need to be taken seriously, raising the prospect not only of direct harm, but of the more likely effects in generating public concern, reputational harm of agricultural biotechnology companies, law-suits, and increased import bans of certain plants or their derived products."
gmos,"Socio-economic considerations are included in the regulatory frameworks on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) of many countries. This is a reflection of an increasing interest in and recognition of the necessity to consider a broader range of issues when conducting a GMO risk assessment. At the same time, there are discussions about how socio-economic considerations can be identified and how their assessment can be carried out. To provide an understanding of the advances achieved so far, we describe the state of the art of existing biosafety institutional frameworks, legislation and policies with provisions on socio-economic considerations. We analyse the scope of the socio-economic considerations that have been included, the methodological options taken and the role of participatory processes and stakeholders involvement in the GMO-related decision-making. Since many of the countries that have legislation for assessing socio-economic considerations lack implementation experience, we provide an analysis of how implementation has evolved in Norway with the intention to illustrate that the inclusion of socio-economic considerations might be based on a learning process. Norway was the first country to include broader issues in its GMO assessment process, and is at present one of the countries with the most experience on implementation of these issues. Finally, we emphasise that there is a great need for training on how to perform assessments of socio-economic considerations, as well as reflection on possible ways for inclusion of participatory processes."
gmos,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
Following a negative attitude of consumers toward genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the spaces left by the labeling legislation on GMOs of different countries, some retailers and processors introduced their own non-GMO standards, with the intention of avoiding the presence of GMOs in their products. This paper aims to understand how the implementation of these new retailer-driven standards affects governance structures along the supply chain and the determinants of such change focusing on transaction cost approach (TCA) vs resource-based view (RBV). 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The non-GMO introduction is investigated as a case study in the poultry industry of France and Italy. The case relies on data primarily collected from interviews with the main actors at five stages of the supply chain from the retailer up to animal feed and crop production. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Findings indicate that the introduction of non-GMO products had different impacts on the transactions along the supply chain, generally leading to more integrated relationships. Theoretical relevance depends on the observed transaction and the type of governance structure considered. Interestingly, only RBV explains the shift toward hierarchical governance when this is observed. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This paper contributes to the empirical literature highlighting the upstream effects caused by the adoption of new standards. On the theoretical side, building on Conner and Prahalad’s (1996) seminal work and leveraging on the concepts of opportunism, “potential” superior knowledge and strategic importance of an activity, this research suggests a comparative framework for identifying governance structures and their determinants under TCA and RBV."
gmos,"Worldwide, qualitative methods based on PCR are most commonly used as screening tools for genetically modified material in food and feed. However, the increasing number and diversity of genetically modified organisms (GMO) require effective methods for simultaneously detecting several genetic elements marking the presence of transgenic events. Herein we describe the development and validation of a pentaplex, as well as complementary triplex and duplex real-time PCR assays, for the detection of the most common screening elements found in commercialized GMOs: P-35S, T-nos, ctp2-cp4-epsps, bar, and pat. The use of these screening assays allows the coverage of many GMO events globally approved for commercialization. Each multiplex real-time PCR assay shows high specificity and sensitivity with an absolute limit of detection below 20 copies for the targeted sequences. We demonstrate by intra- and interlaboratory tests that the assays are robust as well as cost- and time-effective for GMO screening if applied in routine GMO analysis."
gmos,"A new advancement in massive DNA-based screening in limited-resource settings is demonstrated through the incorporation of easy-to-fabricate microfluidic chambers on digital versatile discs (DVDs) to perform isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) in a microarray format. Standard un-modified DVD discs and commercial drives are used for the low-cost detection method. DNA primers were printed in a microarray format on the polycarbonate surfaces of DVDs with integrated control spots to guarantee the absence of false-negatives and false-positives. The solid-phase amplification assay, including the washing protocols and development reaction, was performed by the dispensation of solutions through the inlet and by controlling the flow-movement by DVD drive centrifugation. The final disc with reaction products was inserted into a DVD player and microarray images were captured and automatically processed. This simple approach was applied for the screening of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food samples. The limit of detection was 7 μg g−1, which is well below the EU regulation limit for GMOs in food products. Therefore, the only required materials for food safety monitoring were standard store-bought DVDs, plastic chambers, tips, pipettes, an oven, and a standard DVD drive. The proposed strategy allows an integrated microarray system with low manipulation, reduced sample volume, and portability, which are beneficial for low-resource settings."
gmos,"This review describes the Swedish approach to directed mutagenesis in plants and puts it in a comparative European perspective. Directed mutagenesis is accomplished by a number of genome editing techniques; however, the legal status of these techniques and their resulting products is uncertain in the European Union (EU) as there is no political consensus on whether or not these should be regulated as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). A number of cases have developed over the past few years, putting the GMO regulatory framework to the test. These include oilseed rape developed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, Arabidopsis developed by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9, and the case on mutagenesis for which the French Court requested a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the EU. In this review, the involvement of the Swedish Government and governmental authorities in these cases is described and compared with that of other EU member states and/or EU entity statements and reports. Various approaches to the definition of recombinant nucleic acids are also discussed, as this is crucial for the EU GMO definition thus affecting the legal status of products developed by directed mutagenesis."
gmos,"Abstract The adoption of Directive 2015/412 marks a turning point in policy-making in the European Union since for the first time the legal competence for a regulatory area has been passed from the EU to the member states. The member states can now request their territory to be excluded from authorisation for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for commercial cultivation. In the first step of the analysis, the article shows that higher levels of public support for GMOs decrease the likelihood of member states filing an opt-out request, while controlling for other potential explanatory factors. In the second step, it concentrates on the controversy between the federal and the state level in Germany regarding the transposition of the new directive. It is found that the directive offers some degree of strategic opportunity for pro-GMO political parties to pursue a regulatory approach that would otherwise be impeded by negative public opinion."
gmos,"The public discourse on the acceptability of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is not only controversial, but also infused with highly emotional and moralizing rhetoric. Although the assessment of risks and benefits of GMOs must be a scientific exercise, many debates on this issue seem to remain impervious to scientific evidence. In many cases, the moral psychology attributes of the general public create incentives for both GMO opponents and proponents to pursue misleading public campaigns, which impede the comprehensive assessment of the full spectrum of the risks and benefits of GMOs. The ordonomic approach to economic ethics introduced in this research note is helpful for disentangling the socio-economic and moral components of the GMO debate by re- and deconstructing moral claims."
gmos,"Compared to previous releases of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which were primarily plants, gene drives represent a paradigm shift in the handling of GMOs: Current regulation of the release of GMOs assumes that for specific periods of time a certain amount of GMOs will be released in a particular region. However, now a type of genetic technology arises whose innermost principle lies in exceeding these limits—the transformation or even eradication of wild populations. The invasive character of gene drives demands a thorough analysis of their functionalities, reliability and potential impact. But such investigations are hindered by the fact that an experimental field test would hardly be reversible. Therefore, an appropriate prospective assessment is of utmost importance for an estimation of the risk potential associated with the application of gene drives. This work is meant to support the inevitable characterization of gene drives by a comparative approach of prospective technology assessment with a focus on potential sources of risk. Therein, the hazard and exposure potential as well as uncertainties with regard to the performance of synthetic gene drives are addressed. Moreover, a quantitative analysis of their invasiveness should enable a differentiated evaluation of their power to transform wild populations."
gmos,"In light of the ongoing discussion in the EU whether new plant varieties generated by genome editing are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or not, we propose a novel approach for regulating plant breeding in general. Our proposal involves a flexible and scalable system that is capable of adapting to the rapid evolution of new technologies such as genome editing. It proposes an operational method that accounts for traditional and novel technologies, and a dynamically scalable risk assessment, which focuses on the phenotype of a novel breed instead of the method used to generate it. This approach would also resolve various dichotomies in the current debate, namely declaring new genome editing methods as highly efficient, while ignoring the impact of yet unknown risks, and proposing exemptions from regulation on the basis of the type of DNA created, whereas an older technology with fully characterized risks would still carry a heavy regulatory burden. Our proposal also takes into account that any new risk paradigm must be understood and accepted by the public, suggesting a greater role for farmers in ensuring the safe use of new breeding technologies.

### Definitions

There are various guidelines and regulations worldwide used to assess the risks of genetically modified crops (see Further Reading Box 1 for USA and Canada), but the EU's regulatory framework arguably has the biggest impact given the size of the market and given its influence on other jurisdictions around the world. In 1990, the EU adopted its first regulatory framework, replaced in 2001 by Directive 2001/18/EC “on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms” (GMO). According to Article 2, a GMO “means an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination”. However, “the …"
gmos,"The development of genetically modified crops has had a great impact on the agriculture and food industries. However, the development of any genetically modified organism (GMO) requires the application of analytical procedures to confirm the equivalence of the GMO compared to its isogenic non-transgenic counterpart. Moreover, the use of GMOs in foods and agriculture faces numerous criticisms from consumers and ecological organizations that have led some countries to regulate their production, growth, and commercialization. These regulations have brought about the need of new and more powerful analytical methods to face the complexity of this topic. In this regard, MS-based technologies are increasingly used for GMOs analysis to provide very useful information on GMO composition (e.g., metabolites, proteins). This review focuses on the MS-based analytical methodologies used to characterize genetically modified crops (also called transgenic crops). First, an overview on genetically modified crops development is provided, together with the main difficulties of their analysis. Next, the different MS-based analytical approaches applied to characterize GM crops are critically discussed, and include ""-omics"" approaches and target-based approaches. These methodologies allow the study of intended and unintended effects that result from the genetic transformation. This information is considered to be essential to corroborate (or not) the equivalence of the GM crop with its isogenic non-transgenic counterpart."
gmos,"In vivo viral gene therapy and somatic cell therapy products (whether autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic) that have been subjected to an ex vivo gene transfer procedure will normally be classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Europe, not just the gene transfer vectors used in their construction. These products are, therefore, expected to fulfill certain environmental requirements with regard to the biosafety aspects of their clinical use (which may be subject to review by government departments responsible for environmental affairs). In the European Union (EU), clinical trials using GMOs generally require three levels of review (in addition to local review processes), which are often performed by separate national agencies. In this study, the principles under which certain EU member states control use of the GMOs in clinical trials under the definitions of either ""contained use"" or ""deliberate release"" will be discussed and evaluated from a scientific and a regulatory perspective, with comparisons with non-EU expectations as described by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Japanese living modified organisms (LMOs) regulations. For the latter, an understanding of the criteria under which LMOs exemptions apply, notably with respect to the nature of the viral construct used, the manufacturing process, and demonstration that there is no detectable residual replication-competent virus in the final gene-modified cells, is of paramount importance. Building on the existing European, U.S., and Japanese experience with GMOs/LMOs within the context of experimental gene and cell therapies, a through reflection on, and harmonization of, the current global GMO framework is needed to avoid unnecessary delays in clinical development and to ensure a smooth and a rapid access by patients to innovative life-saving therapies."
gmos,"The overall goal of the on-going Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project is to develop a coordinated global monitoring network for mercury, including ground-based, high altitude and sea level stations. In order to ensure data reliability and comparability, a significant effort has been made to implement a centralized system, which is designed to quality assure and quality control atmospheric mercury datasets. This system, GMOS-Data Quality Management (G-DQM), uses a web-based approach with real-time adaptive monitoring procedures aimed at preventing the production of poor-quality data. G-DQM is plugged on a cyberinfrastructure and deployed as a service. Atmospheric mercury datasets, produced during the first-three years of the GMOS project, are used as the input to demonstrate the application of the G-DQM and how it identifies a number of key issues concerning data quality. The major issues influencing data quality are presented and discussed for the GMOS stations under study. Atmospheric mercury data collected at the Longobucco (Italy) station is used as a detailed case study."
gmos,"The Gemini Multiobject Spectrograph (GMOS) installed on the Gemini‐North telescope has a facility for integral field spectroscopy over the wavelength range 0.4–1.0 μm. GMOS is converted to this mode by the remote insertion of an integral field unit (IFU) into the beam in place of the masks used for the multiobject mode. With the IFU deployed, integral field spectroscopy is available over a fully filled contiguous field of 5′′ × 7′′ with a sampling of 0.″2. A separate field of half the area, but otherwise identical, is also provided to improve background subtraction. The IFU contains 1500 lenslet‐coupled fibers and is the first facility of any type for integral field spectroscopy employed on an 8–10 m telescope. We describe the design, construction, and testing of the GMOS IFU and present measurements of the throughput both in the laboratory and at the telescope. We compare these with a theoretical prediction made before construction started. All are in good agreement with each other, with the on‐telescope throughput exceeding 60% (averaged over wavelength). A second paper will verify the scientific performance by comparison with existing one‐ and two‐dimensional data sets."
gmos,"This paper presents results of a collaborative trial study (IUPAC project No. 650/93/97) involving 29 laboratories in 13 countries applying a method for detecting genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food. The method is based on using the polymerase chain reaction to determine the 35S promotor and the NOS terminator for detection of GMOs. reference materials were produced that were derived from genetically modified soy beans and maize. Correct identification of samples containing 2% GMOs is achievable for both soy beans and maize. For samples containing 0.5% genetically modified soy beans, analysis of the 35S promotor resulted also in a 100% correct classification. However, 3 false-negative results (out of 105 samples analyzed) were reported for analysis of the NOS terminator, which is due to the lower sensitivity of this method. Because of the bigger genomic DNA of maize, the probability of encountering false-negative results for samples containing 0.5% GMOs is greater for maize than for soy beans. For blank samples (0% GMO), only 2 false-positive results for soy beans and one for maize were reported. These results appeared as very weak signals and were most probably due to contamination of laboratory equipment."
gmos,"The introduction of novel proteins into foods carries a risk of eliciting allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the introduced protein and a risk of sensitizing susceptible individuals. No single predictive test exists to perform a hazard assessment in relation to allergenic properties of newly expressed proteins in gene-modified organisms (GMOs). Instead, performance of a weighted risk analysis based on the decision tree approach has been suggested. The individual steps of this analysis comprise sequence homology to known allergens, specific or targeted serum screens for immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactions to known allergens, digestability studies of the proteins in simulated gastric and/or intestinal fluids, and animal studies. These steps are discussed and five examples of risk evaluation of GMOs or novel foods are presented. These include ice-structuring protein derived from fish, microbial transglutaminase, GMO-soybeans, amylase and the Nangai nut."

gmos,"Research in public policy and political economy has provided many insights in the evolution of public resistance against genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the last two decades. But how does the partisan composition of a government, its programmatic orientation and the allocation of cabinet offices affect policy making in this specific area? We argue that the regulation of GMOs is determined by the ideological orientation of governments and the presence of parties with a specific ideological background in the cabinet. In addition, we hypothesize that the parties' control over relevant cabinet posts matter for GMO regulation. We test our hypotheses by using an innovative dataset that contains information on biotechnology regulation outputs of European governments in the time period from 1996 until 2013, the partisan composition and policy-area specific positions of governments, and the party affiliation of key cabinet actors. The results show that the presence of a Christian democratic party in a cabinet increases the chances of a ban on biotech crops, in particular if it controls the Ministry of the Environment."
gmos,"The competitive quest of the Cartagena Protocol and the WTO for authority to regulate international trade in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) exemplifies a typical interaction between international institutions with diverging objectives. This article first develops a conceptual framework for the analysis of institutional interaction that emphasizes disaggregation of complex interaction situations into separate cases of clearly directed inter-institutional influence. These cases can follow different causal mechanisms. Second, applying this framework to the interaction between the Cartagena Protocol and the WTO reveals that existing commitments have driven parties toward a step-wise delimitation of the institutions' jurisdictions. Although the WTO acquired a firstmover advantage by structuring the regulatory field, the Cartagena Protocol showed surprising strength in exploiting the remaining room for maneuver. The structure of international governance thus steers institutions with differing objectives toward a jurisdictional balance that, while reflecting existing power relations, limits the potential for conflict and frames available policy choices."

gmos,"Recombinant DNA techniques are capable of introducing genetic changes into food organisms that are more predictable than those introduced through conventional breeding techniques. This review discusses whether the consumption of DNA in approved novel foods and novel food ingredients derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be regarded as being as safe as the consumption of DNA in existing foods. It concludes that DNA from GMOs is equivalent to DNA from existing food organisms that has always been consumed with human diets. Any risks associated with the consumption of DNA will remain, irrespective of its origin, because the body handles all DNA in the same way. The breakdown of DNA during food processing and passage through the gastrointestinal tract reduces the likelihood that intact genes capable of encoding foreign proteins will be transferred to gut microflora. The review does not specifically address food safety issues arising from the consumption of viable genetically modified microorganisms but it shows that the likelihood of transfer and functional integration of DNA from ingested food by gut microflora and/or human cells is minimal. Information reviewed does not indicate any safety concerns associated with the ingestion of DNA per se from GMOs resulting from the use of currently available recombinant DNA techniques in the food chain."
gmos,"This 2 × 2 experimental study (N = 196) tested the effects of source expertise and opinion valence in readers’ comments on the credibility of an online news story about genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Source expertise had a significant influence on perceptions of article credibility; articles were judged more credible when public comments embedded in the story were from expert sources (e.g., scientists) rather than nonexpert sources (e.g., Twitter users). Effects were larger on high-frequency news users, regardless of whether comments were for or against GMOs. Results suggest that Internet users mainly use the peripheral or heuristic route of information processing to evaluate online news credibility.

The technology has bestowed most of its benefits on enhancing crop productivity with two main traits currently dominating the market: insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops. Despite their rapid and vast adoption by farmers worldwide, GMOs have generated heated debates, especially in European countries (EU), driven mostly by consumers concerned about safety of transgenic foods and about the potential impact on the environment. The need to monitor and to verify the presence and the amount of GMOs in agricultural crops and in food products has generated interest in analytical methods for sensitive, accurate, rapid, and cheap detection of these products. DNA biosensors have been envisioned as a novel DNA-detection technology that would one day substitute current amplification-based methods, providing hand-held, quick, and ultrasensitive gene-level detection. This review summarizes the contributions made in nearly 20 years of research regarding the application of genosensing technology for the qualitative and quantitative determination of transgenic traits. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT"
gmos,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to measure Mexicans’ perceptions and attitudes about the production and consumption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
A questionnaire with 63 questions that encompassed 11 latent factors was used to obtain information. The questionnaire was administered to 14,720 people in Mexico’s urban areas. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results revealed important similarities and differences with studies in other countries, showing mainly that the respondents did not have sufficient information about GMOs, they have low level of knowledge about GMOs (31.28 percent), are highly distrustful of GMOs, perceive high risk regarding GMOs (59.13 percent), want transgenic products to be labeled (93.59 percent) and do not perceive GMOs’ social values and positive health effects beyond increasing agricultural productivity. Also, it was observed that the higher the educational level of individuals, the lower the acceptance of GMOs. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The authors conclude that it is necessary to generate and provide scientifically accurate information on GMOs, so that people are better informed and can give a critical opinion on the use of GMOs. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The major practical contribution of this research is that it provides empirical knowledge about the perceptions and attitudes toward the production and consumption of GMOs among the Mexican’s urban society, which can be of great help for the Mexican government to rethink if it is an appropriate moment to completely open the doors to international companies to cultivate crops like maize and others that have been postponed due to pressure from the environmental groups, farmers and other sectors of the society. 
 
 
 
 
Social implications 
 
 
 
 
This is especially important in the context of maize as it is part of the cultural heritage of Mexico since ancient times. However, it is not clear what the overall perception is in the Mexican society on the use of GMOs for cultivation. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
Southern regions of Mexico are the center of origin of several cultivated plants such as maize and legumes. The introduction of GMOs, called transgenics, in agriculture and food continues to cause enormous controversy in the perceptions and attitudes mainly among environmental groups and farmers in Mexico."
gmos,"Biotechnology, as an emerging technology, has drawn much attention from the public and elicited hot debates in countries around the world and among various stakeholders. Due to the public's limited access to front-line scientific information and scientists, as well as the difficulty of processing complex scientific knowledge, the media have become one of the most important channels for the public to get news about scientific issues such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). According to framing theory, how the media portray GMO issues may influence audiences’ perceptions of those issues. Moreover, different countries and societies have various GMO regulations, policies and public opinion, which also affect the way media cover GMO issues. Thus, it is necessary to investigate how GMO issues are covered in different media outlets across different countries. We conducted a comparative content analysis of media coverage of GMO issues in China, the US and the UK. One mainstream news portal in each of the three countries was chosen (People's Daily for China, The New York Times for the US, and The Guardian for the UK). We collected coverage over eight years, from 2008 to 2015, which yielded 749 pieces of news in total. We examined the sentiments expressed and the generic frames used in coverage of GMO issues. We found that the factual, human interest, conflict and regulation frames were the most common frames used on the three portals, while the sentiments expressed under those frames varied across the media outlets, indicating differences in the state of GMO development, promotion and regulation among the three countries."
gmos,"Progress in the field of recombinant nucleic acid techniques and cross-species gene delivery in the 1970s and 1980s prompted legislators in the European Union (EU) to develop biosafety regulations encompassing these techniques and their resulting products. The ensuing procedure for risk assessment and risk management of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), as these were denominated, in the EU has thus been established with the purpose of ensuring a high level of protection of human health and the environment. The early draft legislative texts on GMOs in the EU (Commission of the European Communities, 1988) resulted in the first Council Directive on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs (Dir 90/220/EEC) in 1990 (Official Journal of the European Communities, 1990). From these early drafts, it is clear that the intentions were to have an evolving and increasingly trait-oriented regulatory framework taking into account technical developments, potential safe history of use as well as potential benefits resulting from the application of these techniques and their resulting products. However, despite nearly three decades of research, product development, demonstrated benefits and a lack of demonstrated risks associated with recombinant nucleic acids per se, the GMO regulatory framework in the EU has neither evolved nor been implemented as intended. I here list four details for which policy makers in the EU need to consider the original intentions of the GMO regulatory framework in order to correctly interpret the current legislative texts as well as allow for necessary updates following technical progress."
gmos,": Immunomodulatory feed additives might offer alternatives to antimicrobial growth promoters in pig production. This experiment was designed to determine the effects of dietary galacto-mannan-oligosaccharide (GMOS) and chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) supplementation on the immune response in early-weaned piglets. Forty 15-day-old piglets (DurocxLandracexYorkshire) with an average live body weight of 5.6±0.51 kg were weaned and randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups that were fed maize-soybean meal diets containing either basal, 110 mg/kg of lincomycin, 250 mg/kg of COS or 0.2% GMOS, respectively, over a 2-week period. Another six piglets of the same age were sacrificed on the same day at the beginning of the study for sampling, in order to obtain baseline values. Interleukin (IL)-1β gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes, jejunal mucosa and lymph nodes, as well as serum levels of IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-6, IgA, IgG, and IgM, were evaluated for 5 pigs from each group at 15 and 28 days of age. The results indicate that weaning stress resulted in decreases in serum antibody and cytokine levels. Dietary supplementation with GMOS or COS enhanced (p<0.05) IL-1β gene expression in jejunal mucosa and lymph nodes, as well as serum levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IgA, IgG and IgM compared to supplementation with lincomycin. These findings suggest that GMOS or COS may enhance the cell-mediated immune response in early-weaned piglets by modulating the production of cytokines and antibodies, which shows that GMOS or COS have different effects than the antibiotic on animal growth and health."
gmos,"Genetically modified (GM) foods constitute a hotly debated socioscientific issue in China, yet the topic is ostensibly absent from Chinese official media. Flourishing social media platforms appear to fill the void. To understand how the Chinese public engages in the GMO debate on various nationwide social media platforms, this study examines the role of social media and social capital (i.e., resources derived from social relationships, particularly in online communities) as predictors. Results of a large-scale online survey ( N = 1,370) using a stratified quota sample showed that bridging social capital is a significant predictor of respondents’ likelihood of expressing opinions on the controversy on Chinese social media platforms. Moreover, this relationship was found to be mediated by use of social media for GMO-related information—greater bridging capital leads to more informed respondents about GMOs, which in turn predicts their willingness to speak their mind about the issue online. Our study also discusses the implications for social media as an emerging networked sphere for public deliberation in media-rich, information-poor China."
gmos,"Abstract. In May 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released the report “Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects,” summarizing scientific consensus on genetically engineered crops and their implications. NASEM reports aim to give the public and policymakers information on socially relevant science issues. Their impact, however, is not well understood. This analysis combines national pre- and post-report survey data with a large-scale content analysis of Twitter discussion to examine the report's effect on public perceptions of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We find that the report's release corresponded with reduced negativity in Twitter discourse and increased ambivalence in public risk and benefit perceptions of GMOs, mirroring the NASEM report's conclusions. Surprisingly, this change was most likely for individuals least trusting of scientific studies or university scientists. Our findings indicate that NASEM consensus reports can help shape public discourse, even in, or perhaps because of, the complex information landscape of traditional and social media."
gmos,"There is an urgent need for rapid, low-cost multiplex methodologies for the monitoring of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Here, we report a C[combining low line]apillary A[combining low line]rray-based L[combining low line]oop-mediated isothermal amplification for M[combining low line]ultiplex visual detection of nucleic acids (CALM) platform for the simple and rapid monitoring of GMOs. In CALM, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) primer sets are pre-fixed to the inner surface of capillaries. The surface of the capillary array is hydrophobic while the capillaries are hydrophilic, enabling the simultaneous loading and separation of the LAMP reaction mixtures into each capillary by capillary forces. LAMP reactions in the capillaries are then performed in parallel, and the results are visually detected by illumination with a hand-held UV device. Using CALM, we successfully detected seven frequently used transgenic genes/elements and five plant endogenous reference genes with high specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, we found that measurements of real-world blind samples by CALM are consistent with results obtained by independent real-time PCRs. Thus, with an ability to detect multiple nucleic acids in a single easy-to-operate test, we believe that CALM will become a widely applied technology in GMO monitoring."
gmos,"In the EU, method validation is an essential part of the process that regulates the introduction of new GMOs as food and/or feed into the market. When the inter-laboratory validation study is completed, the method is ready to be implemented in routine testing laboratories. When implementing the new method, the laboratory has to verify that the method can be used for its intended purpose (method verification). The scope of this document is to provide guidance on how to carry out the method verification of inter-laboratory validated methods for the qualitative and quantitative detection of GMOs. Considering that the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the method of choice in the EU for the identification and quantification of GMOs, this document refers exclusively to real time PCR. However, if novel methods are subsequently developed that fulfil legal requirements, then this document will be amended accordingly."
gmos,"In this article, we address the public issue of mandatory Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) retail food labeling in the U.S., first by reviewing the policy arguments both in support and against labeling food containing GMOs; second, by describing the existing U.S. federal regulatory system pertaining to GMO labeling, and why it does not presently require labeling of food containing GMOs; third, by reviewing and interpreting the results of studies of American consumer attitudes toward mandatory GMO retail food labeling; fourth, by evaluating, through the utilization of issue life cycle analysis in the nonmarket environment, where the issue of GMO retail food labeling stands in the national public policy process; fifth, summarizing the state of scientific evidence addressing the safety of GMO foods and the existing regulatory and public policy environment for this issue; and sixth, offering legislative and litigation strategies for the mainstream food nonmarket strategy framework to formally assess the GMO industry to protect their interests and those of American consumers not concerned with GMO food ingredients, while offering a voluntary labeling strategy for firms responding to and recognizing the “rights” of American consumers who “choose” to purchase non‐GMO food products."
gmos,"“Genetically Modified Organisms” are not a consistent category: it is impossible to discuss such a miscellaneous bunch of products, deriving from various biotech methods, as if they had a common denominator. Critics are too often pre-emptively suspicious of peculiar risks for health or the environment linked to this ill-assorted ensemble of microorganisms, plants or animals: yet, even before being unscientific, the expression “GMO(s)” has very poor semantic value. Similarly, claims that recombinant DNA technology is always safe are a misjudgement: many unsatisfactory “GMOs” have been discarded, as has happened also for innumerable agri-food outcomes, obtained via more or less traditional field and lab methods. The scientific consensus, i.e. the widespread accord among geneticists, biologists and agriculturalists, maintains that every biotech invention has to be examined case by case, evaluating the unique profile of each new organism (“GMO” or otherwise): to assess its safety, the technique(s) used to produce it are irrelevant. Therefore, in considering “green” biotechnologies, a triple mantra should be kept in mind: 1. product, not process; 2. singular, not plural; 3. a posteriori, not a priori. Both people’s and law-makers’ attitude to agricultural biotechnologies should be reoriented, and this is an interesting task for science communicators: they should explain how meaningless and misleading the “GMO” frame is, debunking a historical, ongoing socio-political blunder, clarifying to the public what most life scientists have been recommending for several decades.

gmos,"We tested whether individuals can exert control over the expression of attitudinal ambivalence and if this control is exerted with self-presentational concerns. Using the self-presentation paradigm, participants reported more ambivalence about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in a standard and a self-enhancement (present yourself positively) conditions than in a self-depreciation (present yourself negatively) condition, on felt (Experiments 1a and 2a) and potential ambivalence, in its cognitive (Experiments 1b and 2b) and affective components (Experiments 1b and 2c). The role of ambivalent attitudes in conveying a positive social value was confirmed by the fact that the above effect was found on a controversial attitude object (GMOs), but the opposite appeared on a noncontroversial one (e.g., tooth brushing, a truism; Experiment 3). Such a reversal was obtained by directly manipulating the perception of controversy on GMOs (Experiment 4). Attitudinal ambivalence may thus serve an adaptive function, that is, achieving a positive social value."
gmos,"The purpose of this article is to compile the destruction of GMO trials from academic or governmental research institutes in Europe, in a factual manner and to highlight their main characteristics. About 80 acts of vandalism against academic or governmental research on GMOs are identified, mainly in 4 countries; namely France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Examples are also provided for Italy and Belgium. The general conclusions that can be drawn from these acts are also discussed."
gmos,"Organic farming prohibits the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) inasmuch as their genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally. In actual fact, there is a conventional identity between GMOs and transgenic organisms, so that genetic modification methods such as somatic hybridization and mutagenesis are equalized to conventional breeding. A loophole in this system is represented by more or less innovative genetic engineering approaches under regulatory discussion, such as cisgenesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and antisense technologies, that are redefining the concept of GMOs and might circumvent the requirements of the GMO legislation and, indirectly, of organic farming."
gmos,"Current genetically modified organism (GMO) detection methods allow for sensitive detection. However, a further increase in sensitivity will enable more efficient testing for large grain samples and reliable testing for processed foods. In this study, we investigated real-time PCR-based GMO detection methods using a large amount of DNA template. We selected target sequences that are commonly introduced into many kinds of GM crops, i.e., 35S promoter and nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator. This makes the newly developed method applicable to a wide range of GMOs, including some unauthorized ones. The estimated LOD of the new method was 0.005% of GM maize events; to the best of our knowledge, this method is the most sensitive among the GM maize detection methods for which the LOD was evaluated in terms of GMO content. A 10-fold increase in the DNA amount as compared with the amount used under common testing conditions gave an approximately 10-fold reduction in the LOD without PCR inhibition. Our method is applicable to various analytical samples, including processed foods. The use of other primers and fluorescence probes would permit highly sensitive detection of various recombinant DNA sequences besides the 35S promoter and NOS terminator."
gmos,"A new generation of thermal sensors based on a suspended thermal transistor MOS (TMOS), fabricated in the standard CMOS-SOI process, released by postetching, has been recently developed. One of the important features of TMOS is its high responsivity due to the transistor built-in amplification and subthreshold operation enabling a wide range of battery applications. This paper focuses on a new gas sensor, dubbed GMOS, based on the TMOS. The GMOS is a catalytic gas sensor (pellistor-like), and as such detects combustible gases in air. The CMOS-SOI technology combined with tungsten metallization enables operation at very high temperatures (450 °C was tested). The sensors and readout are processed with the same CMOS-SOI technology. Accordingly, the GMOS sensor, processed in low-cost CMOS-SOI technology, promises to become the widely accepted gas sensing approach for mobile applications, including wearables, smart homes, as well as smartphones."
gmos,"The ability to manipulate and customize the genetic code of living organisms has brought forth the production of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and consumption of genetically modified (GM) foods. The potential for GM foods to improve the efficiency of food production, increase customer satisfaction, and provide potential health benefits has contributed to the rapid incorporation of GM foods into the American diet. However, GM foods and GMOs are also a topic of ethical debate. The use of GM foods and GM technology is surrounded by ethical concerns and situational judgment, and should ideally adhere to the ethical standards placed upon food and nutrition professionals, such as: beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice and autonomy. The future of GM foods involves many aspects and trends, including enhanced nutritional value in foods, strict labeling laws, and potential beneficial economic conditions in developing nations. This paper briefly reviews the origin and background of GM foods, while delving thoroughly into 3 areas: (1) GMO labeling, (2) ethical concerns, and (3) health and industry applications. This paper also examines the relationship between the various applications of GM foods and their corresponding ethical issues. Ethical concerns were evaluated in the context of the code of ethics developed by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) that govern the work of food and nutrition professionals. Overall, there is a need to stay vigilant about the many ethical implications of producing and consuming GM foods and GMOs."
gmos,"The institutional environment for planting GM crops in Europe is heterogeneous. Poland wants to ban the planting of GM crops; Spanish farmers have been growing Bt-maize for several years; 120 communities in Belgium have declared themselves to be GMO-free; a local grain trader in Germany has announced that it will pay the same price for Bt and non-Bt maize. Luxemburg wants to fine farmers up to 750,000 for non-compliance with coexistence rules and in Poland a prison sentence of up to three years may be given; farmers in Upper Austria must apply for authorization for each field intended to be planted with GM crops and farmers in Denmark have to pay a levy of 100 DK per hectare of GM crops. In 2003, the European Commission stated that “no form of agriculture, be it conventional, organic or agriculture using genetically modified organism (GMOs), should be excluded in the European Union” but simultaneously decided to follow the principle of subsidiary that “measures for coexistence should be developed and implemented by the Member States” (CEC 2003a, p. 1). Since then, some Member States have developed, and others are still developing, a diversity of coexistence measures that may have a profound impact on the adoption rate of GM crops. Against this background, we ask the following question: How will the different coexistence policies among EU Member States affect the adoption of GM crops?"
gmos,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate awareness and perception of GM foods of Turkish consumers living in Istanbul, Turkey. Design/methodology/approach – A consumer survey consisting of 23 questions has been prepared. Totally 1,315 people participated in the survey. Awareness of the consumers about genetically modified organisms, willingness to purchase GM foods, acceptability of GM foods by consumers and legislations and information sources were assessed in the questionnaire. Nonparametric test were applied in order to unravel demographic differences. Findings – The results of the survey showed that consumers generally know what genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are, but they do not have enough information about the genetic modification process. The main concerns of consumers about GMFs are their carcinogenic effects to human. In addition, corn was found to be the most concerned GMF.

gmos,"SUMMARY We examined the available evidence on the effectiveness of measures aimed at protecting humans and the environment against the risks of working with genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) and with non-GMO pathogenic microorganisms. A few principles and methods underlie the current biosafety practice: risk assessment, biological containment, concentration and enclosure, exposure minimization, physical containment, and hazard minimization. Many of the current practices are based on experience and expert judgment. The effectiveness of biosafety measures may be evaluated at the level of single containment equipment items and procedures, at the level of the laboratory as a whole, or at the clinical-epidemiological level. Data on the containment effectiveness of equipment and laboratories are scarce and fragmented. Laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) are therefore important for evaluating the effectiveness of biosafety. For the majority of LAIs there appears to be no direct cause, suggesting that failures of biosafety were not noticed or that containment may have been insufficient. The number of reported laboratory accidents associated with GMOs is substantially lower than that of those associated with non-GMOs. It is unknown to what extent specific measures contribute to the overall level of biosafety. We therefore recommend that the evidence base of biosafety practice be strengthened."
gmos,"This paper engages with recent debates in geography and associated disciplines that are concerned with the wider analytic issues to be confronted in researching an elite. Drawing on a case study of the construction of a policy position on GMOs and the Environment in Ireland, the methodological challenges encountered researching up the hybrid elite central to this development are interrogated. In particular, emphasis is placed on the politics of time, which becomes central when a new sector is emerging, and meanings and definitions are being constructed."
gmos,"For enforcement of the recently introduced labeling threshold for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food ingredients, quantitative detection methods such as quantitative competitive (QC-PCR) and real-time PCR are applied by official food control laboratories. The experiences of 3 European food control laboratories in validating such methods were compared to describe realistic performance characteristics of quantitative PCR detection methods. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) of GMO-specific, real-time PCR was experimentally determined to reach 30-50 target molecules, which is close to theoretical prediction. Starting PCR with 200 ng genomic plant DNA, the LOQ depends primarily on the genome size of the target plant and ranges from 0.02% for rice to 0.7% for wheat. The precision of quantitative PCR detection methods, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), varied from 10 to 30%. Using Bt176 corn containing test samples and applying Bt176 specific QC-PCR, mean values deviated from true values by -7to 18%, with an average of 2+/-10%. Ruggedness of real-time PCR detection methods was assessed in an interlaboratory study analyzing commercial, homogeneous food samples. Roundup Ready soybean DNA contents were determined in the range of 0.3 to 36%, relative to soybean DNA, with RSDs of about 25%. Taking the precision of quantitative PCR detection methods into account, suitable sample plans and sample sizes for GMO analysis are suggested. Because quantitative GMO detection methods measure GMO contents of samples in relation to reference material (calibrants), high priority must be given to international agreements and standardization on certified reference materials."
gmos,"The DNA target sequence is the key element in designing detection methods for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately this information is frequently lacking, especially for unauthorized GMOs. In addition, patent sequences are generally poorly annotated, buried in complex and extensive documentation and hard to link to the corresponding GM event. Here, we present the JRC GMO-Amplicons, a database of amplicons collected by screening public nucleotide sequence databanks by in silico determination of PCR amplification with reference methods for GMO analysis. The European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed (EU-RL GMFF) provides these methods in the GMOMETHODS database to support enforcement of EU legislation and GM food/feed control. The JRC GMO-Amplicons database is composed of more than 240 000 amplicons, which can be easily accessed and screened through a web interface. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at pooling and collecting publicly available sequences related to GMOs in food and feed. The JRC GMO-Amplicons supports control laboratories in the design and assessment of GMO methods, providing inter-alia in silico prediction of primers specificity and GM targets coverage. The new tool can assist the laboratories in the analysis of complex issues, such as the detection and identification of unauthorized GMOs. Notably, the JRC GMO-Amplicons database allows the retrieval and characterization of GMO-related sequences included in patents documentation. Finally, it can help annotating poorly described GM sequences and identifying new relevant GMO-related sequences in public databases. The JRC GMO-Amplicons is freely accessible through a web-based portal that is hosted on the EU-RL GMFF website. Database URL: http://gmo-crl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/jrcgmoamplicons/"
gmos,"Detection and quantification of transgenes are important in analyzing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is commonly utilized for such purposes. However, qPCR has certain limitations in detecting and quantifying transgenes in GMOs, such as the need of certified reference materials, a standard curve, and possible affection by inhibitors. Therefore, alternative and possibly better methods are needed. Recent advances in digital PCR technologies have promised to allow accurate quantification of nucleic acids and therefore provided another useful technique to analyze GMOs. Thermo Fisher ScientificTM has recently commercialized the Applied BiosystemsTM QuantStudioTM 3D digital PCR system that can be used for a wide range of applications involving nucleic acids. It will be beneficial to the scientific community to show the applicability of this digital PCR system in detecting and quantifying transgenes in GMOs. In the present study, the transgenes present in the Roundup Ready Soybean (RR1, event 40-3-2) and Roundup Ready Soybean 2 (RR2, event MON89788) developed by Monsanto Corporation were analyzed by using this digital PCR system. The qPCR analysis results were included for comparison. Using specifically designed TaqMan assays, as low as 1% of the RR1 or RR2 soybean material was reliably detected and quantified on the dPCR platform. Therefore, digital PCR is a sensitive and reliable method to analyze the RR transgenic soybeans, and should be another useful tool for analyzing other transgenic plants."

gmos,"Genetic modification (GM) of mosquitoes (which renders them genetically modified organisms, GMOs) offers opportunities for controlling malaria. Transgenic strains of mosquitoes have been developed and evaluation of these to 1) replace or suppress wild vector populations and 2) reduce transmission and deliver public health gains are an imminent prospect. The transition of this approach from confined laboratory settings to open field trials in disease-endemic countries (DECs) is a staged process that aims to maximize the likelihood of epidemiologic benefits while minimizing potential pitfalls during implementation. Unlike conventional approaches to vector control, application of GM mosquitoes will face contrasting expectations of multiple stakeholders, the management of which will prove critical to safeguard support and avoid antagonism, so that potential public health benefits can be fully evaluated. Inclusion of key stakeholders in decision-making processes, transfer of problem-ownership to DECs, and increased support from the wider malaria research community are important prerequisites for this. It is argued that the many developments in this field require coordination by an international entity to serve as a guiding coalition to stimulate collaborative research and facilitate stakeholder involvement. Contemporary developments in the field of modern biotechnology, and in particular GM, requires competencies beyond the field of biology, and the future of transgenic mosquitoes will hinge on the ability to govern the process of their introduction in societies in which perceived risks may outweigh rational and responsible involvement."
gmos,"Protein-based detection methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow strip, have been widely used for rapid, spot, and sensitive detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

The end-point fluorescent detection system was carried out using QDs conjugated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The newly developed Cry1Ab QD-FLISA assay was highly specific to the Cry1Ab protein and had no cross-reactivity with other target proteins, such as Cry2Ab, Cry1F, and Cry3Bb. The quantified linearity was achieved in the value range of 0.05-5% (w/w). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the QD-FLISA were 2.956 and 9.854 pg/mL, respectively, which were more sensitive than the conventional sandwich ELISA method. All of the results indicated that QD-FLISA was a highly specific and sensitive method for the monitoring of Cry1Ab in GMOs."

Technological Revolution Meets Policy and the Market: Explaining Cross-National Differences in Agricultural Biotechnology Regulation. European Journal of Political Research 42/5:643-683.Please read and cite the published version.The development and marketing of agricultural biotechnology applications has led to controversies over whether and how to regulate this new technology. In response, the European Union has imposed severe restrictions on agricultural biotechnology, particularly in terms of approval and labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food. In stark contrast, the United States maintains a far more permissive approval policy and does not require labeling. This article explains these differences in terms of the collective action capacity of consumer and producer interests, as well as the institutional environment in which regulation takes place. We find that the regulatory outcome in the EU can be traced back to NGOs' increased collective action capacity, an institutional environment favorable to NGO interests, and rifts in the producer coalition due to differences in industrial structure and consumer and NGO opposition. U.S. biotechnology politics is dominated by a strong and cohesive coalition of pro-biotech agricultural and up- and downstream producers. Low public concern and high trust in regulatory authorities have made mobilization of NGOs in the U.S. difficult and have resulted largely in their exclusion from the policy process."
gmos,"With the development of transgenic crops, many countries have issued regulations to label the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their derived products. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods are thought to be reliable and useful techniques for qualitative and quantitative detection of GMOs. These methods generally need to amplify the transgene and compare the amplified result with that of the corresponding reference gene to obtain reliable results. In this article, we reported the development of specific primers and probe for the rice (Oryza sativa) sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) gene and PCR cycling conditions suitable for the use of this sequence as an endogenous reference gene in both qualitative and quantitative PCR assays. Both methods were assayed with 13 different rice varieties, and identical amplification products were obtained with all of them. No amplification products were observed when DNA samples from other species, such as wheat, maize, barley, tobacco, soybean, rapeseed, tomato, sunflower, carrot, pepper, eggplant, lupine, mung bean, plum, and Arabidopsis thaliana, were used as templates, which demonstrated that this system was specific for rice. In addition, the results of the Southern blot analysis confirmed that the SPS gene was a single copy in the tested rice varieties. In qualitative and quantitative PCR analyses, the detection sensitivities were 0.05 and 0.005 ng of rice genomic DNA, respectively. To test the practical use of this SPS gene as an endogenous reference gene, we have also quantified the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in transgenic rice using this reference gene. These results indicated that the SPS gene was species specific, had one copy number, and had a low heterogeneity among the tested cultivars. Therefore, this gene could be used as an endogenous reference gene of rice and the optimized PCR systems could be used for practical qualitative and quantitative detection of transgenic rice."
gmos,"This tutorial review will address the issue of DNA determination in food by using Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) probes with different technological platforms, with a particular emphasis on the applications devoted to food authentication. After an introduction aimed at describing PNAs structure, binding properties and their use as genetic probes, the review will then focus specifically on the use of PNAs in the field of food analysis. In particular, the following issues will be considered: detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), of hidden allergens, of microbial pathogens and determination of ingredient authenticity. Finally, the future perspectives for the use of PNAs in food analysis will be briefly discussed according to the most recent developments."
gmos,"By the joining of the European Union (EU), the Central and Eastern European states had to align their agricultural biotechnology regulations to EU standards. In some cases, this meant the adoption of stricter regulations such as for the co-existence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and conventional crops. In other cases, harmonisation with EU rules entailed the need to give up more restrictive national regulation, for example: to allow the cultivation of a limited number of GMOs. This article examines why some Central and Eastern European states joined the group of Western European countries that instituted bans on the commercial cultivation of GMOs in the EU. This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it contends that the prohibition of the commercial cultivation of GMOs in some Central and Eastern European member states must be interpreted in light of the EU-wide public and political contestation of GMOs. Second, this piece of research shows that the ideological composition of governments matters in explaining the regulation of agricultural biotechnology. This second contribution allows for going beyond the predominant focus on public opinion when analysing the regulation of GMOs in the EU."
gmos,"The detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food and feed is an important issue for all the subjects involved in raw material control, food industry, and distribution. Because the number of GMOs authorized in the EU increased during the past few years, there is a need for methods that allow a rapid screening of products. In this paper, we propose a method for the simultaneous detection of four transgenic maize (MON810, Bt11, Bt 176, and GA21) and one transgenic soybean (Roundup Ready), which allows routine control analyses to be sped up. DNA was extracted either from maize and soybean seeds and leaves or reference materials, and the recombinant DNA target sequences were detected with 7 primer pairs, accurately designed to be highly specific for each investigated transgene. Cross and negative controls were performed to ensure the specificity of each primer pair. The method was validated on an interlaboratory ring test and good analytical parameters were obtained (LOD = 0.25%, Repeatability, (r) = 1; Reproducibility, (R) = 0.9). The method was then applied to a model biscuit made of transgenic materials baked for the purpose and to real samples such as feed and foodstuffs. On account of the high recognition specificity and the good detection limits, this multiplex PCR represents a fast and reliable screening method directly applicable in all the laboratories involved in raw material and food control."
gmos,"Since the 18th of April 2004, two new regulations, EC/1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed products and EC/1830/2003 on traceability and labeling of GMOs, are in force in the EU. This new, comprehensive regulatory framework emphasizes the need of an adequate tracing system. Unique identifiers, such as the transgene genome junction region or a specific rearrangement within the transgene DNA, should form the basis of such a tracing system. In this study, we describe the development of event-specific tracing systems for transgenic maize lines Bt11, Bt176, and GA21 and for canola event GT73. Molecular characterization of the transgene loci enabled us to clone an event-specific sequence into a plasmid vector, to be used as a marker, and to develop line-specific primers. Primer specificity was tested through qualitative PCRs and dissociation curve analysis in SYBR Green I real-time PCRs. The primers were then combined with event-specific TaqMan probes in quantitative real-time PCRs. Calibration curves were set up both with genomic DNA samples and the newly synthesized plasmid DNA markers. It is shown that cloned plasmid GMO target sequences are perfectly suitable as unique identifiers and quantitative calibrators. Together with an event-specific primer pair and a highly specific TaqMan probe, the plasmid markers form crucial components of a unique and straighforward tracing system for Bt11, Bt176, and GA21 maize and GT73 canola events."
gmos,"Glyceryl monooleate (GMO) is one of the most popular amphiphilic lipids, which, in the presence of different amounts of water and a proper amount of stabilizer, can promote the development of well defined, thermodynamically stable nanostructures, called lyotropic liquid crystal dispersions. The aim of this study is based on the design, characterization, and evaluation of the cytotoxicity of lyotropic liquid crystal nanostructures containing a model anticancer drug such as doxorubicin hydrochloride. The drug is efficiently retained by the GMO nanosystems by a remote loading approach. The nanostructures prepared with different non-ionic surfactants (poloxamers and polysorbates) are characterized by different physico-chemical features as a function of several parameters, i.e., serum stability, temperature, and different pH values, as well as the amount of cryoprotectants used to obtain suitable freeze-dried systems. The nanostructures prepared with poloxamer 407 used as a stabilizer show an increased toxicity of the entrapped drug on breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) due to their ability to sensitize multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells through the inhibition of specific drug efflux transporters. Moreover, the interaction between the nanostructures and the cells occurs after just a few hours, evidencing a huge cellular uptake of the nanosystems."
gmos,"Discussion regarding the regulatory status of genome-edited crops has focused on precision of editing and on doubts regarding the feasibility of analytical monitoring compliant with existing GMO regulations. Effective detection methods are important, both for regulatory enforcement and traceability in case of biosafety, environmental or socio-economic impacts. Here, we approach the analysis question for the first time in the laboratory and report the successful development of a quantitative PCR detection method for the first commercialized genome-edited crop, a canola with a single base pair edit conferring herbicide tolerance. The method is highly sensitive and specific (quantification limit, 0.05%), compatible with the standards of practice, equipment and expertise typical in GMO laboratories, and readily integrable into their analytical workflows, including use of the matrix approach. The method, validated by an independent laboratory, meets all legal requirements for GMO analytical methods in jurisdictions such as the EU, is consistent with ISO17025 accreditation standards and has been placed in the public domain. Having developed a qPCR method for the most challenging class of genome edits, single-nucleotide variants, this research suggests that qPCR-based method development may be applicable to virtually any genome-edited organism. This advance resolves doubts regarding the feasibility of extending the regulatory approach currently employed for recombinant DNA-based GMOs to genome-edited organisms."
gmos,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most widespread form of dementia where there is an age related degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Accumulation of α-synuclein (αS) protein aggregate, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal cell death are the pathological hallmarks of PD. In this context, amalgamation of curcumin and piperine having profound cognitive properties, and antioxidant activity seems beneficial. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the major impediment for delivery of neurotherapeutics to the brain. The present study involves formulation of curcumin and piperine coloaded glyceryl monooleate (GMO) nanoparticles coated with various surfactants with a view to enhance the bioavailability of curcumin and penetration of both drugs to the brain tissue crossing the BBB and to enhance the anti-parkinsonism effect of both drugs in a single platform. In vitro results demonstrated augmented inhibition of αS protein into oligomers and fibrils, reduced rotenone induced toxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and activation of autophagic pathway by dual drug loaded NPs compared to native counterpart. Further, in vivo studies revealed that our formulated dual drug loaded NPs were able to cross BBB, rescued the rotenone induced motor coordination impairment, and restrained dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in a PD mouse model."
gmos,"Resilient suppliers can reduce supply chain risk, effectively avoid supply chain disruption, and bring profits to enterprises. However, there is no united measuring index system to evaluate the resilient supplier under supply chain environment, and the assessment language sets are usually crisp values. Therefore, in order to fill the research gap, this paper proposes a hybrid method, which combines triangular fuzzy number, the best-worst method (BWM), and the modular TOPSIS in random environments for group decision-making (GMo-RTOPSIS) to solve the above problem. Firstly, the weight of decision-maker is calculated by using fuzzy BWM which can deal with triangular fuzzy numbers. Secondly, triangular fuzzy number is introduced into GMo-RTOPSIS, and combined with fuzzy BWM, alternatives are sorted to select the best resilient supply chain partner. Finally, the feasibility and universality of this method are proved by illustrative examples."
gmos,"While uncertainty is central to science, many fear negative effects of communicating scientific uncertainties to the public, though research results about such effects are inconsistent. Therefore, we test the effects of four distinct uncertainty frame types (deficient, technical, scientific, consensus) on three outcomes (belief, credibility, behavioral intentions) across three science issues (climate change, GMO food labeling, machinery hazards) with an experiment using a national sample (N = 2,247) approximating U.S. census levels of age, education, and gender. We find portraying scientific findings using uncertainty frames usually does not have significant effects, with an occasional exception being small negative effects of consensus uncertainty."
gmos,"Moringa oleifera seeds were processed as raw M. oleifera (RMO), germinated M. oleifera (GMO), and fermented M. oleifera (FMO), and were evaluated for proximate, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, phytochemicals/antinutrients, and functional properties. Protein content of GMO (23.69 ± 0.11 g/100 g) was higher than FMO (21.15 ± 0.08 g/100 g) and that of RMO (18.86 ± 0.09 g/100 g) (P < 0.05), respectively. Energy value of FMO (465.32 ± 0.48 kcal) was higher than GMO (438.62 ± 0.12 kcal) and that of RMO (409.04 ± 1.61 kcal), respectively. Mineral contents in GMO were significantly higher in iron, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and copper, while FMO were higher in calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, and both were significantly lower than those in RMO (P < 0.05). Total essential amino acids (TEAAs) in FMO (31.07 mg/g crude protein) were higher than in GMO (26.52 mg/g crude protein), and were higher than that in RMO (23.56 mg/g crude protein). Linoleic acid (58.79 ± 0.02–62.05 ± 0.01 g/100 g) and behenic acid (0.13 ± 0.00–0.20 ± 0.06 g/100 g) were the predominant and least fatty acids, respectively. Phytochemical/antinutrient compositions in FMO samples were significantly lower than GMO, and both were significantly lower when compared with RMO samples (P < 0.05). The bulk density (pack and loose), foaming capacity, swelling capacity, and water absorption capacity (WAC) of FMO were significantly higher than those of GMO, and there was no significant difference between GMO and RMO samples. The study established that fermentation processing methods increased the protein content, essential amino acid, and polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles, and reduced antinutrient compositions of M. oleifera seed than germination processing techniques; hence, fermentation techniques should be encouraged in processing moringa seeds in food processing."
gmos,"Abstract This article fills the gap in literature by studying consumers’ perceptions of the genetically modified (GM) food labeling systems in China, in terms of the comparison between the mandatory “Contains GMO” and the voluntary “non-GMO” labels. Using a recent survey, we find that the mandatory “Contains GMO” labeling system is considered more important relative to the voluntary “non-GMO” labeling system, and factors driving the perceptions of the two systems are different. Consumers who have more objective GM food knowledge, higher concerns about the GM foods’ health effects, lower intentions to buy GM foods, and higher income perceive both labeling systems as more important than their counterparts. Consumers who believe that they have eaten GM foods without being aware of it consider the mandatory “Contains GM” labeling more important, while consumers who believe GM foods unsafe and oppose GM technology consider the voluntary “non-GMO” labeling more important. The results support the mandatory GM labeling system."
gmos,"New Zealand (NZ) is a small country with an export-led economy with above 90% of primary production exported. Plant-based primary commodities derived from the pastoral, horticultural and forestry sectors account for around half of the export earnings. Productivity is characterized by a history of innovation and the early adoption of advanced technologies. Gene editing has the potential to revolutionize breeding programmes, particularly in NZ. Here, perennials such as tree crops and forestry species are key components of the primary production value chain but are challenging for conventional breeding and only recently domesticated. Uncertainty over the global regulatory status of gene editing products is a barrier to invest in and apply editing techniques in plant breeding. NZs major trading partners including Europe, Asia and Australia are currently evaluating the regulatory status of these technologies and have not made definitive decisions. NZ is one of the few countries where the regulatory status of gene editing has been clarified. In 2014, the NZ Environmental Protection Authority ruled that plants produced via gene editing methods, where no foreign DNA remained in the edited plant, would not be regulated as GMOs. However, following a challenge in the High Court, this decision was overturned such that NZ currently controls all products of gene editing as GMOs. Here, we illustrate the potential benefits of integrating gene editing into plant breeding programmes using targets and traits with application in NZ. The regulatory process which led to gene editing's current GMO classification in NZ is described and the importance of globally harmonized regulations, particularly to small export-driven nations is discussed."
gmos,"What does the rise of organic food as a social phenomenon mean politically? What political impact does this form of consumption have on society? Is it a small and unimportant “blip” in the overall march of globalized, industrialized food and rationalized consumption systems. Is it even, perhaps, complicit in this process? Or is it a radical break ? The array of answers to these questions forms the “production–consumption debate” currently taking place in the examination of agro–food systems. If agro–food networks are conceptualized as interactive, socio–ecological metabolic circuits linking agricultural nature, social labor, the corporeal and the symbolic, then this paper argues that analytical concern in agrofood studies has focused overwhelmingly on the production ‘moment’ in these circuits. Despite the lessons of numerous ‘food scares’, anti–GMO movements and the mad cow disease pandemic, an asymmetry now holds sway in agro–food studies between production and consumption even though in other fields, as Jackson (1999) notes, consumption has been “duly acknowledged” (p. 95). As this asymmetry is addressed, a contemporary reformulation of the ‘agrarian question’ might investigate the potential for new forms of progressive food politics, ranging from ‘weak’ struggles over the modes of social orderings, such as knowledge systems, to more formal alliances between producers and consumers"
gmos,"pH-responsive lipid nanocarriers have the potential to selectively target the acidic extracellular pH environment of cancer tissues and may further improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutics by minimizing their toxic side-effects. Here, we present the design and characterization of pH-sensitive nano-self-assemblies of the poorly water-soluble anticancer drug 2-hydroxyoleic acid (2OHOA) with glycerol monooleate (GMO). pH-triggered nanostructural transformations from 2OHOA/GMO nanoparticles with an internal inverse hexagonal structure (hexosomes) at pH around 2.0-3.0, via nanocarriers with an internal inverse bicontinuous cubic structure (cubosomes) at pH 2.0-4.5, to vesicles at pH 4.5-7.4 were observed with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. ζ-potential measurements highlight that the pH-driven deprotonation of the carboxylic group of 2OHOA, and the resulting charge-repulsions at the lipid-water interface account for these nanostructural alterations. The study provides detailed insight into the pH-dependent self-assembly of 2OHOA with GMO in excess buffer at physiologically relevant pH values, and discusses the effects of pH alterations on modulating their nanostructure. The results may guide the further development of pH-responsive anticancer nanocarriers for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to the local microenvironment of tumor cells."

We fully concur with the conclusions of the Public Consultation where almost 80% of the participants responded that the existing provisions of the current GMO legislation are not adequate for plants obtained by targeted mutagenesis or cisgenesis. This is a clear request of relevant stakeholders for a new framework for plants obtained by NGTs.
gmos,"Catalytic esterification of glycerol with oleic acid (OA) was optimized over hydrophobic mesoporous zirconia-silica heterogeneous acid catalyst (ZrO2-SiO2-Me&Et-PhSO3H) and benchmarked with commercial catalysts (Aquivion and Amberlyst 15) in order to examine the effect of catalyst acidity on conversion, yield and product selectivity. The process optimisation results showed an 80% conversion with a 59.4% glycerol mono-oleate (GMO) and 34.6% glycerol dioleate (GDO) selectivities corresponding to a combined GMO and GDO selectivity of 94.8% at equimolar OA-to-glycerol ratio, 160°C reaction temperature, 5 wt% catalyst concentration with respect to the OA weight and 4 h reaction time. This work reveals that the hydrophobic and mild acidic ZrO2-SiO2-Me&Et-PhSO3H catalyst outperformed Amberlyst 15 and Aquivion with a yield of 82% and GMO selectivity of 60%. It is found that catalyst acidity is a key parameter for catalytic activity and conversion rate. Nevertheless, high acidity/acid strength reduced the product yield in the glycerol esterification of OA."
gmos,"Method validation is therefore an essential component of the measures that a laboratory should implement to allow it to produce reliable analytical data. In some sectors, most notably in the analysis of food, the requirement for methods that have been “fully validated” is prescribed by legislation. ‘Full’ validation for an analytical method is usually taken to comprise an examination of the characteristics of the method in an interlaboratory method performance study (also known as a collaborative study or collaborative trial). Internationally accepted protocols have been established for the ‘full’ validation of a method of analysis by a collaborative trial, most notably the International Harmonised Protocol and the ISO procedure. These protocols/standards require a minimum number of laboratories and test materials to be included in the collaborative trial to validate fully the analytical method."
gmos,"The European Commission requested that the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms deliver a scientific opinion related to risk assessment of cisgenic and intragenic plants. The EFSA GMO Panel considers that the Guidance for risk assessment of food and feed from genetically modified plants and the Guidance on the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified plants are applicable for the evaluation of food and feed 
products derived from cisgenic and intragenic plants and for performing an environmental risk assessment and do not need to be developed further. It can be envisaged that on a case-by-case basis lesser amounts of eventspecific 
data are needed for the risk assessment. The EFSA GMO Panel compared the hazards associated with plants produced by cisgenesis and intragenesis with those obtained either by conventional plant breeding techniques or by transgenesis. The Panel concludes that similar hazards can be associated with cisgenic and conventionally bred plants, while novel hazards can be associated with intragenic and transgenic plants. The Panel is of the opinion that all of these breeding methods can produce variable frequencies and severities of unintended effects. The frequency of unintended changes may differ between breeding techniques and their occurrence cannot be predicted and needs to be assessed case by case. Independent of the breeding method, undesirable phenotypes are generally removed during selection and testing programmes by breeders. The risks to human and animal health and the environment will depend on exposure factors such as the extent to which the plant is cultivated and consumed."

gmos,"The oral administration of amphotericin B (AmB) has a major drawback of poor bioavailability. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of glyceryl monoolein (GMO) cubosomes as lipid nanocarriers to improve the oral efficacy of AmB. Antifungal efficacy was determined in vivo in rats after oral administration, to investigate its therapeutic use. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) was used in vitro to evaluate transport across a model of the intestinal barrier. In vivo antifungal results showed that AmB, loaded in GMO cubosomes, could significantly enhance oral efficacy, compared against Fungizone®, and that during a 2 day course of dosage 10 mg/kg the drug reached effective therapeutic concentrations in renal tissue for treating fungal infections. In the Caco-2 transport studies, GMO cubosomes resulted in a significantly larger amount of AmB being transported into Caco-2 cells, via both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, but not macropinocytosis. These results suggest that GMO cubosomes, as lipid nanovectors, could facilitate the oral delivery of AmB."
gmos,"Abstract New plant breeding technologies, such as genome editing, are enabling new crop varieties to be developed far quicker and with greater precision and scope than achievable using conventional methods. These advances could help farmers address the challenges of climate change, sustainability, and global food security. However, despite their potential, the uptake of these new technologies has been slowed down due to the uncertainty associated with the regulation of genome edited crops. For many European consumers, their view of new breeding technologies is influenced by many factors. Those who have never faced a major food crisis may not sufficiently appreciate the challenges posed by a projected rise of 2 billion in the human population by 2050. In addition, consumers with a regular and plentiful supply of food may not have to consider how their food is produced, or appreciate the challenges EU farmers are already facing to meet future demand. Misleading online articles, questioning the safety and ethics of these “new” biotech foods, can also lead consumers to be reluctant to accept them. Consequently, Europe's mixed view on biotech crops may also be hindering their adoption in countries who have even more to gain from the technology. In this review, we discuss the current data on global and EU GM crop adoption and the potential impact a new wave of crop development may have for agriculture. We reflect on how the EU has viewed GM crops, and we consider the future of both genetic modification (GM) and genome editing (GE) in the EU. We explore lessons learnt from the adoption of GM crops and examine the potential impact the recent decision not to exempt genome edited crops from the EU GMO Directive, will have on EU farmers, scientists, consumers, trading countries, and the rest of the world."
gmos,"The European Commission requested that the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms deliver a scientific opinion related to risk assessment of plants developed using the zinc finger nuclease 3 technique (ZFN-3) which allows the integration of gene(s) in a predefined insertion site in the genome of the recipient species. Since other nucleases with a similar function to ZFN are considered in this opinion the term site-directed nuclease 3 (SDN-3) is used to describe the technique rather than ZFN-3 specifically. The EFSA GMO Panel considers that its guidance documents are applicable for the evaluation of food and feed products derived from plants developed using the SDN-3 technique and for performing an environmental risk assessment. However, on a case-by-case basis lesser amounts of event specific data may be needed for the risk assessment of plants developed using the SDN-3 technique. The EFSA GMO Panel compared the hazards associated with plants produced by the SDN-3 technique with those obtained by conventional plant breeding techniques and by currently used transgenesis. With respect to the genes introduced, the SDN-3 technique does not differ from transgenesis or from the other genetic modification techniques currently used, and can be used to introduce transgenes, intragenes or cisgenes. The main difference between the SDN-3 technique and transgenesis is that the insertion of DNA is targeted to a predefined region of the genome. Therefore, the SDN-3 technique can minimise hazards associated with the disruption of genes and/or regulatory elements in the recipient genome. Whilst the SDN-3 technique can induce off-target changes in the genome of the recipient plant these would be fewer than those occurring with most mutagenesis techniques. Furthermore, where such changes occur they would be of the same types as those produced by conventional breeding techniques."
gmos,"Bifidobacteria are known to inhibit, compete with and displace the adhesion of pathogens to human intestinal cells. Previously, we demonstrated that goat milk oligosaccharides (GMO) increased the attachment of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 to intestinal cells in vitro. In this study, we aimed to exploit this effect as a mechanism for inhibiting pathogen association with intestinal cells. We examined the synergistic effect of GMO-treated B. infantis on preventing the attachment of a highly invasive strain of Campylobacter jejuni to intestinal HT-29 cells. The combination decreased the adherence of C. jejuni to the HT-29 cells by an average of 42% compared to the control (non-GMO treated B. infantis). Increasing the incubation time of the GMO with the Bifidobacterium strain resulted in the strain metabolizing the GMO, correlating with a subsequent 104% increase in growth over a 24 h period when compared to the control. Metabolite analysis in the 24 h period also revealed increased production of acetate, lactate, formate and ethanol by GMO-treated B. infantis. Statistically significant changes in the GMO profile were also demonstrated over the 24 h period, indicating that the strain was digesting certain structures within the pool such as lactose, lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-neohexaose 3′-sialyllactose, 6′-sialyllactose, sialyllacto-N-neotetraose c and disialyllactose. It may be that early exposure to GMO modulates the adhesion of B. infantis while carbohydrate utilisation becomes more important after the bacteria have transiently colonised the host cells in adequate numbers. This study builds a strong case for the use of synbiotics that incorporate oligosaccharides sourced from goat′s milk and probiotic bifidobacteria in functional foods, particularly considering the growing popularity of formulas based on goat milk."
gmos,"The fact that in a very short period of 35 years the global population will reach an estimated 9 billion people presents a massive challenge to agriculture: how do we feed all of these people with nutritious food in a sustainable way? At the present time the yields of most of our major crops are stagnating but the demand for food, both grain and animal protein, is growing. To meet the challenge of improving crop yields requires a constant commitment to generating a conveyor belt of improved cultivars and lines for all of the major crops. Conventional breeding cannot keep pace with what is required on its own and to meet the targets biotechnology and the production of GM crops is filling the gap. However, there are still concerns as to the safety of GM crops for human consumption and the environment. In this review I explore the need for GM crops, the way they are produced and the impact and safety of GM crops. The future is very promising for GM technologies to enhance our efforts to meet the future global needs for food feed and fiber in a sustainable and responsible way. However, GM crops are only one piece of the puzzle and to meet the targeted yields, nutritional quality, and sustainable production we will need all of the tools at our disposal including conventional and organic food production systems."

gmos,"Very stable in operando and low-loaded atomic molybdenum on solid-support materials have been prepared and tested to be catalytically active for N2 -into-NH3 hydrogenation. Ammonia synthesis is reported at atmospheric pressure and 400 °C with NH3 rates of approximately 1.3×103  μmol h-1  gMo -1 using a well-defined Mo-hydride grafted on silica (SiO2-700 ). DFT modelling on the reaction mechanism suggests that N2 spontaneously binds on monopodal [(≡Si-O-)MoH3 ]. Based on calculations, the fourth hydrogenation step involving the release of the first NH3 molecule represents the rate-limiting step of the whole reaction. The inclusion of cobalt co-catalyst and an alkali caesium additive impregnated on a mesoporous SBA-15 support increases the formation of NH3 with rates of circa 3.5×103  μmol h-1  gMo -1 under similar operating conditions and maximum yield of 29×103  μmol h-1  gMo -1 when the pressure is increased to 30 atm."
gmos,"This study analyzes the effect of voluntary food labeling, with focus on genetically modified organisms (GMO), pesticide usage, and region of origin. We focus on Medjool dates because though U.S. production of this crop has rapidly grown in recent years, no research exists related to consumers’ preferences and WTP for this crop. We conducted online choice experiments with a sample of over 1,400 consumers from the U.S. to determine WTP for production and region of origin labeling accounting for simultaneous versus individual labeling. Results indicate consumers prefer dates grown in Arizona over dates not labeled for region of origin. Also, pesticide‐free and GMO‐free dates are preferred, with pesticide‐free having a larger impact on choices. Furthermore, accounting for interactions between these two labels reveals that they can be considered subadditive in that labeling the product with both designations reduces WTP relative to “pesticide‐free” labeling only.

However, scientific research was not affected by this moratorium, and in 2008, GMO field experiments were conducted that allowed us to examine the factors that influence their acceptance by the public. In this study, trust and confidence items were analyzed using principal component analysis. The analysis revealed the following three factors: “economy/health and environment” (value similarity based trust), “trust and honesty of industry and scientists” (value similarity based trust), and “competence” (confidence). The results of a regression analysis showed that all the three factors significantly influenced the acceptance of GM field experiments. Furthermore, risk communication scholars have suggested that fairness also plays an important role in the acceptance of environmental hazards. We, therefore, included measures for outcome fairness and procedural fairness in our model. However, the impact of fairness may be moderated by moral conviction. That is, fairness may be significant for people for whom GMO is not an important issue, but not for people for whom GMO is an important issue. The regression analysis showed that, in addition to the trust and confidence factors, moral conviction, outcome fairness, and procedural fairness were significant predictors. The results suggest that the influence of procedural fairness is even stronger for persons having high moral convictions compared with persons having low moral convictions."
gmos,"Phytantriol (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane-1,2,3-triol, PHYT) is a cosmetic ingredient that exhibits similar lyotropic phase behavior to monoolein (GMO), forming bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline structures (Q(II)) at low temperatures and reversed hexagonal phase (H(II)) at higher temperatures in excess water. Despite these similarities, phytantriol has received little attention in the scientific community. In this study, the thermal phase behavior of the binary PHYT-water and ternary PHYT-vitamin E acetate (VitEA)-water systems have been studied and compared with the behavior of the dispersed cubosomes and hexosomes formed with the aid of a stabilizer (Pluronic F127). The phase behavior and nanostructure were studied using crossed polarized light microscopy (CPLM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. The presence of lipophilic VitEA in the PHYT-water system suppressed the temperature of the Q(II)-to-H(II)-to-L2 transitions, indicating that lipophilic compounds, in relatively small amounts, may have a significant impact on the phase behavior. Increasing the F127 concentration in the phytantriol-based cubosome system did not induce the Q(II)(Pn3m) to Q(II)(Im3m) transition known for the GMO-water system. This indicates a different mode of interaction between F127 and the lipid domains of phytantriol-water systems. Taken together, these results indicate that phytantriol may not only provide an alternative lipid for preparation of liquid crystalline systems in excess water but may also provide access to properties not available when using GMO."
gmos,"Socio-scientific issues (SSI) have proven to be suitable contexts for students to actively reflect on and argue about complex social issues related to science. Research has indicated that explicitly teaching SSI argumentation is a good way to help students develop their argumentation skills and make them aware of the complexity of SSI. However, assessing the quality of students’ arguments on SSI is evidently difficult for many teachers. This article aims to facilitate teachers’ assessment of the quality of students’ arguments on SSI by introducing a new assessment framework that represents a low degree of complexity and exemplifying it by applying it to students’ written SSI argumentation concerning genetically modified organisms (GMO). The new assessment framework considers both the quality indicators presented in the research literature and curricular guidelines for the science courses in Swedish secondary and upper secondary school. The framework focuses on both the content and the structure that can be revealed in students’ SSI argumentation and is meant to function as a tool for identifying quality indicators that could serve as the basis for grading."
gmos,"Phytoremediation of volatile organic contaminants often proves not ideal because plants and their rhizosphere microbes only partially degrade these compounds. Consequently, plants undergo evapotranspiration that contaminates the ambient air and, thus, undermines the merits of phytoremediation. Under laboratory conditions, endophytic bacteria equipped with the appropriate degradation pathways can improve in planta degradation of volatile organic contaminants. However, several obstacles must be overcome before engineered endophytes will be successful in field-scale phytoremediation projects. Here we report the first in situ inoculation of poplar trees, growing on a TCE-contaminated site, with the TCE-degrading strain Pseudomonas putida W619-TCE. In situ bioaugmentation with strain W619-TCE reduced TCE evapotranspiration by 90% under field conditions. This encouraging result was achieved after the establishment and enrichment of P. putida W619-TCE as a poplar root endophyte and by further horizontal gene transfer of TCE metabolic activity to members of the poplar's endogenous endophytic population. Since P. putida W619-TCE was engineered via horizontal gene transfer, its deliberate release is not restricted under European genetically modified organisms (GMO) regulations."
gmos,"The lipid liquid crystalline sponge phase (L3) has the advantages that it is a nanoscopically bicontinuous bilayer network able to accommodate large amounts of water and it is easy to manipulate due to its fluidity. This paper reports on the detailed characterization of L3 phases with water channels large enough to encapsulate bioactive macromolecules such as proteins. The aqueous phase behavior of a novel lipid mixture system, consisting of diglycerol monooleate (DGMO), and a mixture of mono-, di- and triglycerides (Capmul GMO-50) was studied. In addition, sponge-like nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by Polysorbate 80 (P80) were prepared based on the DGMO/GMO-50 system, and their structure was correlated with the phase behavior of the corresponding bulk system. These NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to determine their size, shape, and inner structure as a function of the DGMO/GMO-50 ratio. In addition, the effect of P80 as stabilizer was investigated. We found that the NPs have aqueous pores with diameters up to 13 nm, similar to the ones in the bulk phase."

Pp. viii + 295, introduction, photographs, appendix, notes, bibliography, index. $60.00 cloth) Crusading ""to improve world nutrition,"" (8) E. N. Anderson says his work is not a textbook or basic reference volume, but a ""question raising essay"" (245). Call it textbook-lite. A worthwhile, if incomplete, survey of nutritional anthropology, Everyone Eats could be useful reading for introductory courses that discuss foodways. Anderson's prose is highly readable and he includes numerous references to scholarly works. His approach to food studies is ""biocultural""-considering not just biology and culture, but also ""political economy, all at once"" (4). Torn between gloom and doom on the one side and techno-optimism on the other, Anderson disputes himself throughout: ""Time is short, ecological disaster is at hand; we have no time to lose"" (8). Yet ""[technology is doing quite well in solving world food problems, and even the much-maligned global marketplace is at least doing what it is supposed to do-motivating production and getting the food around"" (210). Seemingly contradictory statements challenge readers in this attempt to introduce the complexities of world food systems. In the final chapter, ""Feeding the World,"" the author announces that ""we simply cannot do without genetically modified crops [GMOs] in the future"" (220). But while still insisting that GMOs are essential, he writes that we are ""ignorant of the real costs and benefits . . . [and] the technology is untried, uncontrolled and uncertain"" (225). And finally, GMOs ""will not solve the world food problem"" (226). The initial chapters address nutrition and the sensory systems that affect individual perception of foods. While maintaining this biological underpinning, Anderson devotes perhaps twice as much space to sociocultural matters. Chapters on ""Food and Traditional Medicine"" and ""Food and Religion,"" as well as sections on classification systems, identity and status, and the (permeable) boundaries of ethnicity and cuisines, often approximate a folkloric viewpoint. Nutritional anthropology excels in stepping outside the ""ethnographic present"" to embrace the history and pre-history of foodways. Anderson does well in communicating the importance of the past for understanding present-day beliefs and practices. But some of his presentation of modern foodways is less compelling. For example, he discusses ""lifestyle"" as the ""most protean and most important of concepts"" and then quickly concludes that ""[i]t defines individuals and their foodways"" (129). Deeper analysis would help here, and in a few other places. (The paragraph following the one just cited does make a more profound point on a different topic, using a humorous story dealing with familial transmission of foodways.) Anderson's style sometimes approaches snideness when he is dealing with modern practices. …"
gmos,"The Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA GMO Panel) has evaluated the overall safety of genetically modified (GM) carnation SHD-27531-4 cut flowers to be imported into the European Union (EU) for ornamental use. The genetic modification results in the flowers having purple petals. The stability of the new colour trait was observed over multiple vegetative generations. The purple colour of the petals comes from the altered expression levels of anthocyanins, common pigments found in edible fruits and vegetables. Considering the intended use of the GM carnation and the possible routes of exposure, the EFSA GMO Panel did not find indications that the genetic modification will increase the risk of allergy among those coming into contact with carnations. Overall there are no reasons for safety concerns of carnation SHD-27351-4 for humans. The EFSA GMO Panel also considered whether viable seed or pollen from GM carnation cut flowers could be dispersed into the environment and whether GM carnation can be propagated by rooting. Owing to the limited environmental exposure and the biology of the plant, the EFSA GMO Panel did not identify any environmental safety concerns and agrees with the scope of the post-market environmental monitoring plan. The EFSA GMO Panel concludes that the import, distribution and retailing of the GM carnation will not cause adverse effects on human health or the environment."
gmos,"We present for the first time a comparative analysis of blood and organ system data from trials with rats fed three main commercialized genetically modified (GM) maize (NK 603, MON 810, MON 863), which are present in food and feed in the world. NK 603 has been modified to be tolerant to the broad spectrum herbicide Roundup and thus contains residues of this formulation. MON 810 and MON 863 are engineered to synthesize two different Bt toxins used as insecticides. Approximately 60 different biochemical parameters were classified per organ and measured in serum and urine after 5 and 14 weeks of feeding. GM maize-fed rats were compared first to their respective isogenic or parental non-GM equivalent control groups. This was followed by comparison to six reference groups, which had consumed various other non-GM maize varieties. We applied nonparametric methods, including multiple pairwise comparisons with a False Discovery Rate approach. Principal Component Analysis allowed the investigation of scattering of different factors (sex, weeks of feeding, diet, dose and group). Our analysis clearly reveals for the 3 GMOs new side effects linked with GM maize consumption, which were sex- and often dose-dependent. Effects were mostly associated with the kidney and liver, the dietary detoxifying organs, although different between the 3 GMOs. Other effects were also noticed in the heart, adrenal glands, spleen and haematopoietic system. We conclude that these data highlight signs of hepatorenal toxicity, possibly due to the new pesticides specific to each GM corn. In addition, unintended direct or indirect metabolic consequences of the genetic modification cannot be excluded."
gmos,"We compared the efficacy of Pickering crystals, a continuous phase crystal network, and a combination thereof against sedimentation and dispersed phase coalescence in water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions. Using 20 wt % water-in-canola oil emulsions as our model, glycerol monostearate (GMS) permitted Pickering-type stabilization, whereas simultaneous usage of hydrogenated canola oil (HCO) and glycerol monooleate (GMO) primarily led to network-stabilized emulsions. A minimum of 4 wt % GMS or 10 wt % HCO was required for long-term sedimentation stability. Although there were no significant differences between the two in mean droplet size with time, the free water content of the network-stabilized emulsions was higher than Pickering-stabilized emulsions, suggesting higher instability. Microscopy revealed the presence of crystal shells around the dispersed phase in the GMS-stabilized emulsions, whereas in the HCO-stabilized emulsion, spherulitic growth in the continuous phase and on the droplet surface occurred. The displacement energy (E(disp)) to detach crystals from the oil-water interface was ∼10(4) kT, and was highest for GMS crystals. Thermal cycling to induce dispersed phase coalescence of the emulsions resulted in desorption of both GMS and GMO from the interface, which we ascribed to solute-solvent hydrogen bonding between the emulsifier molecules and the solvent oil, based on IR spectra. Overall, Pickering crystals were more effective than network crystals for emulsion stabilization. However, the thermal stability of all emulsions was hampered by the diffusion of the molten emulsifiers from the interface."
gmos,"Abstract Following the submission of application EFSA‐GMO‐RX‐014 under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 from Monsanto Company the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority was asked to deliver a scientific risk assessment on the data submitted in the context of the renewal of authorisation application for the insect‐resistant and herbicide‐tolerant genetically modified maize MON 88017, for food and feed uses, excluding cultivation within the EU. The data received in the context of this renewal application contained post‐market environmental monitoring reports, a systematic search and evaluation of literature, updated bioinformatic analyses, and additional documents or studies performed by or on behalf of the applicant. The GMO Panel assessed these data for possible new hazards, modified exposure or new scientific uncertainties identified during the authorisation period and not previously assessed in the context of the original application. Under the assumption that the DNA sequence of the event in maize MON 88017 considered for renewal is identical to the sequence of the originally assessed event, the GMO Panel concludes that there is no evidence in renewal application EFSA‐GMO‐RX‐014 for new hazards, modified exposure or scientific uncertainties that would change the conclusions of the original risk assessment on maize MON 88017."
gmos,"The increase in food demand in Indonesia is one of the consequences of the imbalance between population growth and declining food products. One of alternative technologies that can be used in plant breeding programs to increase agricultural production, in order to meet food demands, is genetically modified organism (GMO) technology. This technology presents a lot of pros and cons among the public-related impacts that will be accepted by consumers. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of sustainability between GMO and non-GMO foods. The performance measurement model for GMO and non-GMO foods was considered according to the seven issues of sustainability that represented environmental, social, and economic aspects. The assessment method was conducted by using Adjusted Profit (AP) with Total Price Recovery (TPR) indicators and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) by utilizing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Method. Assessments made on each supply chain component included agriculture, processing, and transport to wholesalers/retailers. This study used numerical examples of rice production in Indonesia. The research results found that the performance of non-GMO rice chain is better than GMO rice. It indicates that non-GMO rice is more sustainable. The results show that the proposed model can be applied to measure the sustainability of GMO and Non-GMO agri-food supply chain performance."
gmos,"The EU aspires to utilize the economic advantages of gene-editing technology on one hand and ensure human health and environmental safety on the other. Surrounding the fierce debates over emerging gene-edited plant, the current debate focused on the issue of whether the gene-edited crop should be within or outside the GMO law and its implication for innovation. It should not be forgotten that it is also involved in the complex patentability issues pertaining to the legal interpretation of the patent law. The gene-edited crop is governed by GMO regulations due to its potential risk to human health and environmental safety. But it is heavily patented, as patent regulations ignore its potential risk. This article examines the discrepancy of the gene-edited crop between the existing GMO law and the patent law and reveals the challenges to current EU jurisdiction, including the international trade impediment challenge, the patent monopoly challenge, the market confusion challenge, and the agricultural economy suspension challenge. In the end, this article argues that EU GMO regulations should be bridged with a patent system in facing the regulatory challenges from the gene-edited crop."
gmos,"ABSTRACT The improvement of the agricultural and wine-making qualities of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is hampered by adherence to traditional varieties, the recalcitrance of this plant to genetic modifications, and public resistance to genetically modified organism (GMO) technologies. To address these challenges, we developed an RNA virus-based vector for the introduction of desired traits into grapevine without heritable modifications to the genome. This vector expresses recombinant proteins in the phloem tissue that is involved in sugar transport throughout the plant, from leaves to roots to berries. Furthermore, the vector provides a powerful RNA interference (RNAi) capability of regulating the expression of endogenous genes via virus-induced gene-silencing (VIGS) technology. Additional advantages of this vector include superb genetic capacity and stability, as well as the swiftness of technology implementation. The most significant applications of the viral vector include functional genomics of the grapevine and disease control via RNAi-enabled vaccination against pathogens or invertebrate pests."

The findings showed that different source attributes and message frames used by opinion leaders varied in their respective influences on three dimensions of user engagement—reposts, comments, and likes. The attribute of account verification only predicted surface-level engagement (i.e., liking), whereas account type significantly influenced in-depth engagement (i.e., reposting and commenting). The fact, opportunity, pro-GMO, and international frames positively predicted user engagement."
gmos,"The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of emulsifiers, waxes, fat concentration, and processing conditions on the application of wax oleogel to replace solid fat content and create optimal fat structure in ice cream. Ice creams with 10% or 15% fat were formulated with rice bran wax (RBW), candelilla wax (CDW), or carnauba wax (CBW) oleogels, containing 10% wax and 90% high-oleic sunflower oil. The ice creams were produced using batch or continuous freezing processes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the microstructure of ice cream and the ultrastructure of oleogel droplets in ice cream mixes. Among the wax oleogels, RBW oleogel had the ability to form and sustain structure in 15% fat ice creams when glycerol monooleate (GMO) was used as the emulsifier. TEM images revealed that the high degree of fat structuring observed in GMO samples was associated with the RBW crystal morphology within the fat droplet, which was characterized by the growth of crystals at the outer edge of the droplet. Continuous freezing improved fat structuring compared to batch freezing. RBW oleogels established better structure compared to CDW or CBW oleogels. These results demonstrate that RBW oleogel has the potential to develop fat structure in ice cream in the presence of GMO and sufficiently high concentrations of oleogel."
gmos,"Glyceryl monooleate (GMO)/poloxamer 407 cubic nanoparticles were investigated as potential oral drug delivery systems to enhance the bioavailability of the water-insoluble model drug simvastatin. The simvastatin-loaded cubic nanoparticles were prepared through fragmentation of the GMO/poloxamer 407 bulk cubic-phase gel using high-pressure homogenization. The internal structure of the cubic nanoparticles was identified by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The mean diameter of the cubic nanoparticles varied within the range of 100–150 nm, and both GMO/poloxamer 407 ratio and theoretical drug loading had no significant effect on particle size and distribution. Almost complete entrapment with efficiency over 98% was achieved due to the high affinity of simvastatin to the hydrophobic regions of the cubic phase. Release of simvastatin from the cubic nanoparticles was limited both in 0.1 M hydrochloride solution containing 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate and fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid with a total release of <3.0% at 10 h. Pharmacokinetic profiles in beagle dogs showed sustained plasma levels of simvastatin for cubic nanoparticles over 12 h. The relative oral bioavailability of simvastatin cubic nanoparticles calculated on the basis of area under the curve was 241% compared to simvastatin crystal powder. The enhancement of simvastatin bioavailability was possibly attributable to facilitated absorption by lipids in the formulation rather than improved release."
gmos,"The weight-of-evidence, case-by-case approach is considered the most appropriate way of assessing the allergenicity of genetically modified (GM) food and feed. This scientific opinion discusses various aspects to increase the strength and accuracy of this approach, including the latest developments pertaining to clinical aspects of allergic reactions, structural aspects of GM food and feed and in silico approaches, as well as IgE binding studies and cell-based methods, profiling techniques and animal models. In this context, conclusions and recommendations are provided to update and complement current risk assessment strategies for the allergenicity assessment of newly expressed protein(s) and whole GM food and feed. In summary, it is recommended that with regard to the search for sequence homology and structural similarities, the local alignment method with a known allergen with a threshold of 35% sequence identity over a window of at least 80 amino acids is considered a minimal requirement. When IgE binding tests are considered necessary, e.g. when there is sequence homology and/or structure similarity with known allergens, the use of individual sera from allergic individuals rather than pooled sera is recommended. In addition to the pepsin resistance test, it is recommended that the resistance to digestion of the newly expressed proteins is evaluated using other in vitro digestibility tests mimicking physiological conditions of humans. Finally, when the recipient of the introduced gene is allergenic, in order to compare the allergenicty of the whole GM plant with that of its appropriate comparator(s), it is recommended that relevant characterised endogenous allergens are included in the comparative compositional analysis of the GM plant and its appropriate comparator(s).

gmos,"This study evaluated the gut and peripheral immune response to genetically modified (GM) maize in mice in vulnerable conditions. Weaning and old mice were fed a diet containing MON810 or its parental control maize or a pellet diet containing a GM-free maize for 30 and 90 days. The immunophenotype of intestinal intraepithelial, spleen, and blood lymphocytes of control maize fed mice was similar to that of pellet fed mice. As compared to control maize, MON810 maize induced alterations in the percentage of T and B cells and of CD4(+), CD8(+), gammadeltaT, and alphabetaT subpopulations of weaning and old mice fed for 30 or 90 days, respectively, at the gut and peripheral sites. An increase of serum IL-6, IL-13, IL-12p70, and MIP-1beta after MON810 feeding was also found. These results suggest the importance of the gut and peripheral immune response to GM crop ingestion as well as the age of the consumer in the GMO safety evaluation."
gmos,"Abstract To improve the solubility and bioavailability of oridonin (ORI), glycerol monooleate lipid (GMO)- or phytantriol (PYT)–Poloxamer 407–propylene glycol–water systems were firstly used to develop cubosomes containing ORI for oral delivery. These cubosomes prepared through the fragmentation of bulk gels under homogenization conditions of 1200 bar and nine cycles had a mean particle size of around 200 nm with narrow size distribution, and ORI encapsulation efficiency over 85%. Powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry indicated that ORI was in an amorphous or molecular form in the cubosomes. The internal structures of GMO- and PYT-based cubosomes were revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering as a bi-continuous cubic liquid crystalline phase with Im3m and Pn3m geometry, respectively. About 80% of ORI was released in vitro from GMO- and PYT-based cubosomes at 24 h, showing a sustained release kinetics fitted with Higuchi’s equation. The pharmacokinetic study in rats showed that the PYT-based cubosomes significantly enhanced the adsorption of ORI as compared to the GMO-based cubosomes and ORI suspension, with evidence of longer half-life and greater relative bioavailability (p < 0.01). Therefore, the PYT-based cubosomes containing ORI might be proposed as a promising candidate carrier for the efficient delivery of drug with therapeutic treatment."
gmos,"Antimicrobial approaches are valuable in controlling the development of buccal diseases, but some antibacterial agents have a short duration of activity. Therefore, the development of prolonged delivery systems would be advantageous. Liquid crystalline systems comprising monoolein (GMO)/water have been considered to be a potential vehicle to deliver drugs to the buccal mucosa because of the phase properties that allow for controlled drug release as well as its mucoadhesive properties. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a GMO/water system for the slow release of poly(hexamethylene biguanide) hydrochloride (PHMB) on the buccal mucosa and test the properties of this system with regard to swelling, release profile, antimicrobial activity, and strength of mucoadhesion, with the overall goal of treating buccal infections. The tested systems were capable of modulating drug release, which is controlled by diffusion of the drug throughout the system. Furthermore, PHMB appeared to improve the mucoadhesive properties of the system and may synergistically act with the drug to promote antimicrobial activity against S. mutas and C. albicans, indicating that liquid crystals may be suitable for the administration of PHMB on the buccal mucosa. Therefore, this system could be proposed as a novel system for mucoadhesive drug delivery."
gmos,"PurposeTo develop a novel nanoparticle drug delivery system consisting of chitosan and glyceryl monooleate (GMO) for the delivery of a wide variety of therapeutics including paclitaxel.MethodsChitosan/GMO nanoparticles were prepared by multiple emulsion (o/w/o) solvent evaporation methods. Particle size and surface charge were determined. The morphological characteristics and cellular adhesion were evaluated with surface or transmission electron microscopy methods. The drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release and cellular uptake were determined using HPLC methods. The safety and efficacy were evaluated by MTT cytotoxicity assay in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231).ResultsThese studies provide conceptual proof that chitosan/GMO can form polycationic nano-sized particles (400 to 700 nm). The formulation demonstrates high yields (98 to 100%) and similar entrapment efficiencies. The lyophilized powder can be stored and easily be resuspended in an aqueous matrix. The nanoparticles have a hydrophobic inner-core with a hydrophilic coating that exhibits a significant positive charge and sustained release characteristics. This novel nanoparticle formulation shows evidence of mucoadhesive properties; a fourfold increased cellular uptake and a 1000-fold reduction in the IC50 of PTX.ConclusionThese advantages allow lower doses of PTX to achieve a therapeutic effect, thus presumably minimizing the adverse side effects."
gmos,"This paper examines the reasoning mechanism behind the consumer acceptance of genetically modified foods (GMFs) in China, and investigates influence of source credibility on consumer acceptance of GMFs. Based on the original Persuasion Model—which was developed by Carl Hovland, an American psychologist and pioneer in the study of communication and its effect on attitudes and beliefs—we conducted a survey using multistage sampling from 1167 urban residents, which were proportionally selected from six cities in three economic regions (south, central, and north) in the Jiangsu province through face to face interviews. Mixed-process regression that could correct endogeneity and ordered probit model were used to test the impact of source credibility on consumers’ acceptance of GMFs. Our major finding was that consumer acceptance of GMFs is affected by such factors as information source credibility, general attitudes, gender, and education levels. The reliability of biotechnology research institutes, government offices devoted to management of GM organisms (GMOs), and GMO technological experts have expedited urban consumer acceptance of GM soybean oil. However, public acceptance can also decrease as faith in the environmental organization. We also found that ignorance of the endogeneity of above mentioned source significantly undervalued its effect on consumers’ acceptance. Moreover, the remaining three sources (non-GMO experts, food companies, and anonymous information found on the Internet) had almost no effect on consumer acceptance. Surprisingly, the more educated people in our survey were more skeptical towards GMFs. Our results contribute to the behavioral literature on consumer attitudes toward GMFs by developing a reasoning mechanism determining consumer acceptance of GMFs. Particularly, this paper quantitatively studied the influence of different source credibility on consumer acceptance of GMFs by using mixed-process regression to correct endogeneity in information sources, while taking into consideration of information asymmetry and specific preference in the use of information sources."
gmos,"Abstract Transgenic seeds in both India (Bt cotton) and Brazil (glyphosate-resistant soybeans) spread widely and rapidly through farming communities outside the reach of biosafety or bioproperty institutions. Stealth transgenics are saved, cross-bred, repackaged, sold, exchanged and planted in an anarchic agrarian capitalism that defies surveillance and control of firms and states. The outcome is more pro-poor than alternative modes of diffusion, but undermines a growing consensus in the international development community on appropriate bio-safety and intellectual property institutions for biotechnology. Second, stealth procurement of biotechnology divides nominally pro-poor political coalitions, driven by a great ideational divide on uncertainties and risks of transgenics. The ability of seeds to move underground through stealth strategies of farmers undermines widely-assumed bio-safety-regime capability. Likewise, property in biotechnology appears less monopolistic and powerful, more relational and contingent. Stealth practices of farmers in pursuit of transgenics contrary to wishes of firms, states and many NGOs suggest a different model of the farmer than that often encountered in both developmentalist and anti-‘GMO’ discourse: more active, creative and autonomous, less hapless and supine. Resultant incapacity of social institutions to secure interests of firms and states in biotechnology renders more likely eventual development of controls from genetic engineering – the ‘terminator technology’ of political dramaturgy."
gmos,"Falcon-AO is an automatic tool for aligning ontologies. There are two matchers integrated in Falcon-AO: one is a matcher based on linguistic matching for ontologies, called LMO; the other is a matcher based on graph matching for ontologies, called GMO. In Falcon-AO, GMO takes the alignments generated by LMO as external input and outputs additional alignments. Reliable alignments are gained through LMO as well as GMO according to the concept of reliability. The reliability is obtained by observing the linguistic comparability and structural comparability of the two ontologies being compared. We have performed Falcon-AO on tests provided by OAEI 2005 campaign and got some preliminary results. In this paper, we describe the architecture and techniques of Falcon-AO in brief and present our results in more details. Finally, comments about test cases and lessons learnt from the campaign will be presented."
gmos,"This report details the structural characterization and the in vitro drug-release properties of different local anesthetic bupivacaine (BUP)-loaded inverted-type liquid crystalline phases and microemulsions. The effects of variations in the lipid composition and/or BUP concentration on the self-assembled nanostructures were investigated in the presence of the commercial distilled glycerol monooleate Myverol 18-99K (GMO) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and rotating dialysis cell model were used to characterize the BUP formulations and to investigate the in vitro BUP release profiles, respectively. The evaluation of SAXS data for the BUP-loaded GMO/MCT formulations indicates the structural transition of inverted-type bicontinuous cubic phase of the symmetry Pn3m → inverted-type hexagonal (H(2)) phase → inverted-type microemulsion (L(2)) with increasing MCT content (0-40 wt %). In the absence of MCT, the solubilization of BUP induces the transition of Pn3m → H(2) at pH 7.4; whereas a transition of Pn3m → (Pn3m + H(2)) is detected as the hydration is achieved at pH 6.0. To mimic the drug release and transport from in situ formed self-assembled systems after subcutaneous administration, the release experiments were performed by injecting low viscous stimulus-responsive precursors to a buffer in the dialysis cell leaving the surface area between the self-assembled system and the release medium variable. Our results suggest that the pH-dependent variations in the lipidic partition coefficient, K(l/w), between the liquid crystalline nanostructures and the surrounding buffer solution are significantly affecting BUP release rates. Thus, a first step toward understanding of the drug-release mechanism of this drug-delivery class has been undertaken tackling the influence of drug ionization as well as the type of the self-assembled nanostructure and its release kinetics under pharmaceutically relevant conditions."
gmos,"The recently presented LOPLS-AA all-atom force field for long hydrocarbon chains, based on the OPLS-AA force field, was extended to alcohols, esters, and glyceryl monooleate (GMO) lipids as a model lipid. Dihedral angles were fitted against high level ab initio calculations, and ester charges were increased to improve their hydration properties. Additionally, the ester Lennard-Jones parameters were readjusted to reproduce experimental liquid bulk properties, densities, and heats of vaporization. This extension enabled the setup of LOPLS-AA parameters for GMO molecules. The properties of the lipid force field were tested for the liquid-crystalline phase of a GMO bilayer. The obtained area per lipid for GMO is in good agreement with experiment. Additionally, the lipid dynamics on the subpicosecond to the nanosecond time scale is in excellent agreement with results from time-of-flight (TOF) quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) experiments on a multilamellar monoolein system, enabling here for the first time the critical evaluation of the short-time dynamics obtained from a molecular dynamics simulation of a membrane system."
gmos,"Stability of the mitochondrial genome is controlled by nuclear loci. In plants, nuclear genes suppress mitochondrial DNA rearrangements during development. One nuclear gene involved in this process is Msh1. Msh1 appears to be involved in the suppression of illegitimate recombination in plant mitochondria. To test the hypothesis that Msh1 disruption leads to the type of mitochondrial DNA rearrangements associated with naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility in plants, a transgenic approach for RNAi was used to modulate expression of Msh1 in tobacco and tomato. In both species, these experiments resulted in reproducible mitochondrial DNA rearrangements and a condition of male (pollen) sterility. The male sterility was, in each case, heritable, associated with normal female fertility, and apparently maternal in its inheritance. Segregation of the transgene did not reverse the male sterile phenotype, producing stable, nontransgenic male sterility. The reproducible transgenic induction of mitochondrial rearrangements in plants is unprecedented, providing a means to develop novel cytoplasmic male sterile lines for release as non-GMO or transgenic materials."
gmos,This introductory paper gathers general considerations on the biosafety of virus-derived vectors that are used in human gene therapy and/or vaccination. The importance to assess the potential risks for human health and the environment related to the use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in this case genetically modified viral vectors is highlighted by several examples. This environmental risk assessment is one of the requirements within the European regulatory framework covering the conduct of clinical trials using GMO. Risk assessment methodologies for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified virus-derived vectors have been developed.
gmos,"This article argues that the controversy over genetically modified crops is best understood not in terms of the supposed bias, dishonesty, irrationality, or ignorance on the part of proponents or critics, but rather in terms of differences in values. To do this, the article draws on and extends recent work of the role of values and interests in science, focusing particularly on inductive risk and epistemic risk, and it shows how the GMO debate can help to further our understanding of the various epistemic risks that are present in science and how these risks might be managed."
gmos,"Abstract While economic globalization is frequently cited as a source for regulatory policy convergence, the precise causal links between these two variables often go unexplored. The common thread missing from most of the globalization literature is the role of state agency in the regulation of the global political economy. This paper builds on a simple game-theoretic model of policy coordination to argue that great powers remain the most important actors in determining the extent of policy convergence. When great powers act in concert, there will be effective policy harmonization. When the great powers fail to agree, partial policy convergence will take place through competition. The increasing returns to scale of regulatory harmonization will lead powerful actors to compete for as many allies as possible, leading to strong policy convergence, but at multiple nodes. These different pathways are examined by inspecting the variation in outcomes of two different issue areas: money laundering and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)."
gmos,"Biotech crops are the fastest adopted crop technology in the history of modern agriculture. The commercialisation of GMO is in many countries strictly regulated laying down the need for traceability and labelling. To comply with these legislations, detection methods are needed. To date, GM events have been developed by the introduction of a transgenic insert (i.e., promoter, coding sequence, terminator) into the plant genome and real-time PCR is the detection method of choice. However, new types of genetic elements will be used to construct new GMO and new crops will be transformed. Additionally, the presence of unauthorised GMO in food and feed samples might increase in the near future. To enable enforcement laboratories to continue detecting all GM events and to obtain an idea of the possible presence of unauthorised GMO in a food and feed sample, an intensive screening will become necessary. A pragmatic, cost-effective, and time-saving approach is presented here together with an overview of the evolution of the GMO and the upcoming needs."
gmos,"As silicon-based electronics are reaching the nanosize limits of the semiconductor roadmap, carbon-based nanoelectronics has become a rapidly growing field, with great interest in tuning the properties of carbon-based materials. Chemical functionalization is a proposed route, but syntheses of graphene oxide (G-O) produce disordered, nonstoichiometric materials with poor electronic properties. We report synthesis of an ordered, stoichiometric, solid-state carbon oxide that has never been observed in nature and coexists with graphene. Formation of this material, graphene monoxide (GMO), is achieved by annealing multilayered G-O. Our results indicate that the resulting thermally reduced G-O (TRG-O) consists of a two-dimensional nanocrystalline phase segregation: unoxidized graphitic regions are separated from highly oxidized regions of GMO. GMO has a quasi-hexagonal unit cell, an unusually high 1:1 O:C ratio, and a calculated direct band gap of ∼0.9 eV."
gmos,"Abstract The pressure on businesses to engage not only on profitability but also on social and environmental responsibility has increased in recent times. The study empirically tested the relationship between green marketing orientation (GMO) and environmental and social performance in the context of firms in the hospitality industry. Sustainable performance measurement focuses not only on financial but also on social and environmental performance. The study used the quantitative research design, and the cross-sectional survey method was used for data collection from 192 respondents. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis were used for data analysis. Cronbach’s alpha was used as a measure of reliability. The results indicated a significant positive relationship between GMO and environmental and social performance of hospitality firms. The findings of the study suggest that GMO is a firm-level strategic resource that can improve the sustainable performance of firms in the hospitality sector. Theoretically, the study linked GMO to environmental and social performance of firms. Empirically, the study adds to the literature on the effect of GMO on sustainable performance. Practically, the study suggested recommendations that can improve the adoption of GMO by firms. These include green design, green positioning, green supply chain, and green strategy."
gmos,"The paper develops a composite index of GMO standards restrictiveness for 60 countries, assigning objective scores to six different regulatory dimensions. Using this index and its components, we empirically investigate the political and economic determinants of GMO regulations for 55 countries, controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Results show that many of the determinants highlighted in the theoretical literature, such as the structure of the agricultural sector and the institutional environment are important determinants of the restrictiveness of the GMO regulation. As a key result there emerges a prominent role of the market for information, showing that the structure of domestic mass media (public vs. private) is an important driver of GMO standards."
gmos,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by senile plaques made of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and memory deficits. Thus, the events initiating the cascade leading to these end points may be more effective therapeutic targets than treating each facet individually. In the small percentage of cases of AD that are genetic (or animal models that reflect this form of AD), the factor initiating AD is clear (e.g., genetic mutations lead to high Abeta1-42 or hyperphosphorylated tau proteins). In the vast majority of AD cases, the cause is unknown. Substantial evidence now suggests that abnormalities in glucose metabolism/mitochondrial function/oxidative stress (GMO) are an invariant feature of AD and occur at an early stage of the disease process in both genetic and non-genetic forms of AD. Indeed, decreases in brain glucose utilization are diagnostic for AD. Changes in calcium homeostasis also precede clinical manifestations of AD. Abnormal GMO can lead to plaques, tangles, and the calcium abnormalities that accompany AD. Abnormalities in GMO diminish the ability of the brain to adapt. Therapies targeting mitochondria may ameliorate abnormalities in plaques, tangles, calcium homeostasis, and cognition that comprise AD."
gmos,"Multiplex PCR procedures were developed for simultaneously detecting multiple target sequences in genetically modified (GM) soybean (Roundup Ready), maize (event 176, Bt11, Mon810, T14/25), and canola (GT73, HCN92/28, MS8/RF3, Oxy 235). Internal control targets (invertase gene in corn, lectin and beta-actin genes in soybean, and cruciferin gene in canola) were included as appropriate to assess the efficiency of all reactions, thereby eliminating any false negatives. Primer combinations that allowed the identification of specific lines were used. In one system of identification, simultaneous amplification profiling (SAP), rather than target specific detection, was used for the identification of four GM maize lines. SAP is simple and has the potential to identify both approved and nonapproved GM lines. The template concentration was identified as a critical factor affecting efficient multiplex PCRs. In canola, 75 ng of DNA template was more effective than 50 ng of DNA for the simultaneous amplification of all targets in a reaction volume of 25 microL. Reliable identification of GM canola was achieved at a DNA concentration of 3 ng/microL, and at 0.1% for GM soybean, indicating high levels of sensitivity. Nonspecific amplification was utilized in this study as a tool for specific and reliable identification of one line of GM maize. The primer cry1A 4-3' (antisense primer) recognizes two sites on the DNA template extracted from GM transgenic maize containing event 176 (European corn borer resistant), resulting in the amplification of products of 152 bp (expected) and 485 bp (unexpected). The latter fragment was sequenced and confirmed to be Cry1A specific. The systems described herein represent simple, accurate, and sensitive GMO detection methods in which only one reaction is necessary to detect multiple GM target sequences that can be reliably used for the identification of specific lines of GMOs."
gmos,"The structural and frictional properties of 10 wt% solutions of the amphiphilic molecules glycerol monooleate (GMO) and polyisobutylsuccinimide-polyamine (PIBSA-PAM) in squalane are studied using molecular dynamics simulations in bulk and under confinement between iron-oxide surfaces. GMO is a friction modifier, PIBSA-PAM is a dispersant, and squalane is a good model for typical base oils. A range of liquid compositions and applied pressures is explored and the formation and stability of reverse micelles is determined under quiescent and shear conditions. Micellization is observed mainly in systems with a high GMO content, but PIBSA-PAM may also form small aggregates on its own. In the confined systems under both static and shear conditions, some surfactant molecules adsorb onto the surfaces, with the rest of the molecules forming micelles or aggregates. Shearing the liquid layer under high pressure causes almost all of the micelles and aggregates to break, except in systems with around 7.5 wt% GMO and 2.5 wt% PIBSA-PAM. The presence of micelles and adsorbed surfactants is found to be correlated with a low kinetic friction coefficient, and hence there is an optimum composition range for friction reduction. This work highlights the importance of cooperative interactions between lubricant additives."
gmos,"We describe the development of a novel combined approach for high-throughput analysis of multiple DNA targets based on multiplex Microdroplet PCR Implemented Capillary gel electrophoresis (MPIC), a two-step PCR amplification strategy. In the first step, the multiple target DNAs are preamplified using bipartite primers attached with universal tail sequences on their 5'-ends. Then, the preamplified templates are compartmentalized individually in the microdroplet of the PCR system, and multiple targets can be amplified in parallel, employing primers targeting their universal sequences. Subsequently, the resulting multiple products are analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE). Using genetically modified organism (GMO) analysis as a model, 24 DNA targets can be simultaneously detected with a relative limit of detection of 0.1% (w/w) and absolute limit of detection of 39 target DNA copies. The described system provides a promising alternative for high-throughput analysis of multiple DNA targets."
gmos,"We demonstrate the collective roles of surfactant–triacylglycerol interactions and confined gap shear crystallization on the creation of novel microstructured water-in-oil emulsions containing solid lipid-encapsulated water droplets. The emulsions studied consisted of 20 wt % water dispersed in a mixture of canola oil, a stabilizing fat [hydrogenated canola oil (HCO)] and either glycerol monoleate (GMO) or polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) as surfactants. Following valve homogenization, emulsions were cooled from 70 to 25 °C either in a stirred beaker (bulk-cooling) or on a rheometer stage (confined gap shear-cooling). Irrespective of the cooling protocol, GMO promoted HCO nucleation at the oil–water interface and later in the continuous phase, providing combined Pickering and network stabilization. With PGPR, HCO nucleated in the continuous phase with little evidence of interfacial nucleation. Bulk-cooling resulted in spherulitic HCO crystalline aggregates, whereas in a confined gap, ellipsoidal crysta..."
gmos,"Swelling and phase behaviour of phytantriol and glyceryl monooleate (GMO) matrices with varying water loadings were investigated. Release of a model protein, FITC-Ova was subsequently examined. Polarised light microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering analysis showed that the addition of FITC-Ova only altered the liquid crystalline structure of phytantriol matrices at low water loadings, and that postrelease study, the phase structure of matrices at both low and high loading reflected that of the binary system. Addition of FITC-Ova to GMO matrices also altered the liquid crystalline structure when compared to the respective binary system at low but not at high loading. All samples analysed after the release study had transformed to the reverse hexagonal phase (H(II)). Swelling studies revealed a faster and more extensive swelling of GMO when compared to phytantriol. Release of FITC-Ova from phytantriol matrices was faster and occurred to a greater extent most likely due to the conversion of GMO matrices into the H(II) phase. No effect on release as a function of initial water content was observed for either lipid. We have confirmed that phytantriol based liquid crystalline matrices can sustain the release of a hydrophilic protein, suggesting its suitability as a potential sustained antigen-delivery system."
gmos,"A well designed risk-oriented supply chain management can put companies in a privileged position to deliver sustainable and reliable long-term benefits to all stakeholders in the value chain. The case of GMO-free soybean supply illustrates the various aspects of risk prevention that can lead to a systematic model of sustainable supply chain management. The article illustrates how – after consumers pressed the food industry to exclude GMO soybeans from their products – a sustainable soybean supply chain was established. Approaching the issue on a pragmatic basis, several tools have proved to be useful in constructing the supply chain. The authors show what the crucial points of sustainable supply chain management are. They point out the great contribution of standards and platforms such as BSCI, ETI, SA8000 and Fairtrade labelling, whereas process models such as AA1000 provide useful guidance on immunization against potential stakeholder risks. Finally, the article shows how a systematic approach can help companies to establish their tailored sustainable supply chain management. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment."
gmos,"Abstract Following the submission of application EFSA‐GMO‐RX‐008 under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 from Pioneer Hi‐Bred International, Inc. and Dow AgroSciences LLC, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority was asked to deliver a scientific risk assessment on the data submitted in the context of the renewal of authorisation application for the insect‐resistant, herbicide‐tolerant genetically modified maize 1507 × NK603, for food and feed uses, import and processing, excluding cultivation within the EU. The data received in the context of this renewal application contained a systematic search and evaluation of literature, updated bioinformatic analyses and additional documents or studies performed by or on behalf of the applicant. The GMO Panel assessed these data for possible new hazards, modified exposure or new scientific uncertainties identified during the authorisation period and not previously assessed in the context of the original application. In conclusion, under the assumption that the DNA sequence of the events in maize 1507 × NK603 considered for renewal are identical to the newly reported 1507 sequence and the NK603 sequence of the originally assessed two‐event stack maize, the GMO Panel concludes that there is no evidence in the renewal application EFSA‐GMO‐RX‐008 for new hazards, modified exposure or scientific uncertainties that would change the conclusions of the original risk assessment on maize 1507 × NK603 (EFSA, 2006)."

gmos,"Microsatellites have gained wide application for elucidating population structure in nonmodel organisms. Since they are generally noncoding, neutrality is assumed but rarely tested. In Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), microsatellite studies have revealed highly heterogeneous estimates of genetic differentiation among loci. In particular one locus, Gmo 132, has demonstrated elevated genetic differentiation. We investigated possible hitch‐hiking selection at this and other microsatellite loci in Atlantic cod. We employed 11 loci for analysing samples from the Baltic Sea, North Sea, Barents Sea and Newfoundland covering a large part of the species’ distributional range. The ‘classical’ Lewontin–Krakauer test for selection based on variance in estimates of FST and (standardized genetic differentiation) revealed only one significant pairwise test (North Sea–Barents Sea), and the source of the elevated variance could not be ascribed exclusively to Gmo 132. In contrast, different variants of the recently developed ln Rθ test for selective sweeps at microsatellite loci revealed a high number of significant outcomes of pair‐wise tests for Gmo 132. Further, the presence of selection was indicated in at least one other locus. The results suggest that many previous estimates of genetic differentiation in cod based on microsatellites are inflated, and in some cases relationships among populations are obscured by one or more loci being the subject to hitch‐hiking selection. Likewise, temporal estimates of effective population sizes in Atlantic cod may be flawed. We recommend, generally, to use a higher number of microsatellite loci to elucidate population structure in marine fishes and other nonmodel species to allow for identification of outlier loci that are subject to selection."
gmos,"BACKGROUND
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently accompanied by motor problems (MPs). We investigated a possible shared etiology between the two traits in the Dutch sample of the International Multicenter ADHD Genetics study comprising 275 children with ADHD and their affected or unaffected sibling and 146 unrelated control children.


METHOD
Exploratory data analysis and bivariate structural equation modeling were used to estimate the familiality of MP rated by parents (Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire [DCD-Q]) or teachers (Groningen Motor Observation Scale [GMO]) and to determine the familial and environmental correlation between MP and ADHD. Furthermore, the nature of the familiality was explored by studying the siblings of ADHD-affected children.


RESULTS
The ADHD-affected children had significantly more MP than their unaffected siblings, who in turn had significantly more MP than the control subjects. The familial component of MP measured by DCD-Q and GMO was 47% and 22%, respectively. The familial correlation between motor performance measures and ADHD was -0.38 for DCD-Q and -0.40 for GMO. Our data suggested that co-occurrence of ADHD and MP possibly marks a distinct subtype of ADHD, rather than signaling increased severity of disease.


CONCLUSIONS
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and MP have a common basis that may be due to genetic factors and/or shared environmental factors. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder accompanied by MP may behave like a distinct subtype of ADHD, but more research will be needed to support that hypothesis."
gmos,"Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA GMO Panel) assessed the post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) report for the 2012 growing season of maize MON 810 provided by Monsanto Europe S.A. The EFSA GMO Panel noted that the applicant used a similar methodology as the one previously established for monitoring maize MON 810 in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The EFSA GMO Panel therefore focused its assessment on the novel datasets specific to the 2012 growing season of maize MON 810, and not on the methodology. The data submitted by the applicant in its 2012 PMEM report do not indicate any adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment arising from maize MON 810 cultivation in 2012. However, having already highlighted the poor sensitivity of the methodology followed by the applicant, the EFSA GMO Panel strongly reiterates its previous recommendations for the improvement of the methodology. In addition, the EFSA GMO Panel recommends that the applicant: (1) further investigates effects observed during the monitoring of baseline susceptibility of target pests in Spain; (2) follow-up possible adverse effects of maize MON 810 on rove beetles.

gmos,"Introduction: The aim of burn management and therapy is fast healing and epithelisation to prevent infection. The present study is concerned with the development and characterization of a novel nanaoparticulate system; cubosomes, loaded with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) and Aloe vera for topical treatment of infected burns. Methods: Cubosome dispersions were formulated by an emulsification technique using different concentrations of a lipid phase Glyceryl Monooleate (GMO) and Poloxamer 407. The optimum formulae were incorporated in an aloe vera gel containing carbopol 934, to form cubosomal hydrogels (cubogels). The cubogels were characterized by in vitro release of SSD, rheological properties, pH, bioadhesion, Transmission Electron Microscopy and in-vivo Wound Healing Study. Results: The results show that the different concentration of GMO had significant effect on particle size, % EE and in vitro drug release. From the in-vitro drug release pattern and similarity factor (f2), it was concluded that batch CG3 (15% GMO and 1% P407) exhibited complete and controlled drug release within 12 hour (i.e. 98.25%), better bio adhesion and superior burn healing as compared to the marketed product. Conclusion: The in vivo burns healing study in rats revealed that the prepared optimized cubogel containing SSD and aloe vera has superior burns healing rate than cubogel with only SSD and marketed preparation so, it may be successfully used in the treatment of deep second degree burn."
gmos,"Ontology matching is an important task to achieve interoperation between semantic web applications using different ontologies. Structural similarity plays a central role in ontology matching. However, the existing approaches rely heavily on lexical similarity, and they mix up lexical similarity with structural similarity. In this paper, we present a graph matching approach for ontologies, called GMO. It uses bipartite graphs to represent ontologies, and measures the structural similarity between graphs by a new measurement. Furthermore, GMO can take a set of matched pairs, which are typically previously found by other approaches, as external input in matching process. Our implementation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph matching approach."
gmos,"A bio bar code assay based on oligonucleotide-modified gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) provides a PCR-free method for quantitative detection of nucleic acid targets. However, the current bio bar code assay requires lengthy experimental procedures including the preparation and release of bar code DNA probes from the target-nanoparticle complex and immobilization and hybridization of the probes for quantification. Herein, we report a novel PCR-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bio bar code assay for the quantitative detection of genetically modified organism (GMO) from raw materials. It consists of tris-(2,2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium (TBR)-labeled bar code DNA, nucleic acid hybridization using Au-NPs and biotin-labeled probes, and selective capture of the hybridization complex by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. The detection of target DNA is realized by direct measurement of ECL emission of TBR. It can quantitatively detect target nucleic acids with high speed and sensitivity. This method can be used to quantitatively detect GMO fragments from real GMO products."
gmos,"We present studies of the delivery of short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) into a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing cell line, using lipid nanocarriers in cubic lyotropic liquid crystal form. These carriers are based on glycerol monooleate (GMO) and employ the use of varying concentrations of cationic siRNA binding lipids. The essential physicochemical parameters of the cationic lipid/GMO/siRNA complexes such as particle size, ζ otential, siRNA uptake stability, lyotropic mesophase behavior, cytotoxicity,and gene silencing efficiency were systematically assessed. We find that the lipid nanocarriers were effectively taken up by mammalian cells and that their siRNA payload was able to induce gene silencing in vitro. More importantly, it was found that the nonlamellar structure of some of the lipid nanocarrier formulations were more effective at gene silencing than their lamellar structured counterparts. The development of cationic lipid functionalized nonlamellar GMO-based nanostructured nanoparticles may lead to improved siRNA delivery vehicles."
gmos,"Pure glyceryl mono-oleate (GMO) (lipid) and different batches of GMO commonly used for the preparation of GMO-chitosan nanoparticles were characterized by modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), cryo-microscopy, and cryo-X-ray powder diffraction techniques. GMO-chitosan nanoparticles containing poloxamer 407 as a stabilizer in the absence and presence of polymers as crystallization inhibitors were prepared by ultrasonication. The effect of polymers (polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), Eudragits, hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), polyethylene glycol (PEG)), surfactants (poloxamer), and oils (mineral oil and olive oil) on the crystallization of GMO was investigated. GMO showed an exothermic peak at around −10°C while cooling and another exothermic peak at around −12°C while heating. It was followed by two endothermic peaks between 15 and 30 C, indicative of GMO melting. The results are corroborated by cryo-microscopy and cryo-X-ray. Significant differences in exothermic and endothermic transition were observed between different grades of GMO and pure GMO. GMO-chitosan nanoparticles resulted in a significant increase in particle size after lyophilization. MDSC confirmed that nanoparticles showed similar exothermic crystallization behavior of lipid GMO. MDSC experiments showed that PVP inhibits GMO crystallization and addition of PVP showed no significant increase in particle size of solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) during lyophilization. The research highlights the importance of extensive physical-chemical characterization for successful formulation of SLN."
gmos,"Abstract Historically, agricultural development evolved in three phases. During the first phase the plants were selected on the basis of the availability of a plant with desirable properties at a specific location. The second phase provided the agricultural community with crossbreeding plants to achieve improvement in agricultural production. The evolution of biological knowledge has provided the ability to genetically engineer (GE) crops, one of the key processes within genetically modified organisms (GMO). This article uses golden rice, a species of transgenic Asian rice which contains a precursor of vitamin A in the edible part of the plant as an example of GE/GMO emphasizing Chinese experience in agricultural evolution. It includes a brief review of agricultural evolution to be followed by a description of golden rice development. Golden rice was created as a humanitarian project and has received positive comments by the scientific community and negative voices from certain environmental groups. In this article, we use the Best Available Science (BAS) Concept and Metrics for Evaluation of Scientific Claims (MESC) derived from it to evaluate claims and counter claims on scientific aspects of golden rice. This article concludes that opposition to golden rice is based on belief rather than any of its scientifically derived nutritional, safety or environmental properties."

gmos,"For beef exporters, one of the important questions in the Korean beef market is why Korean consumers are willing to pay almost three times more for domestic Korean beef than they pay for imported beef. To answer this question, we surveyed 1,000 shoppers in Seoul, Korea, and conducted a conjoint analysis on consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for country equity of domestic vs. imported beef and quality attributes of marbling, freshness, genetically modified organism (GMO)‐free feed ingredients and antibiotic‐free production. Among all factors contributing to the price differentials, the most important factor seems to be the country of origin followed by the use of GMO feeds and antibiotics in beef production, marbling grade and freshness. This study finds that Korean consumers value origins of imported beef approximately $14/lb less than the Korean origin. Korean consumers’ valuation of beef quality and country of origin differs by some demographic groups: older vs. younger generations, homemakers vs. non‐homemakers and consumers who prefer to purchase packaged beef vs. consumers who prefer to purchase butcher shop beef. Our empirical findings suggest that the top priority for beef exporters who wish to increase sales and value of their beef in the Korean market must be to counter Korean consumers’ strong ethnocentrism by improving the value of their country of origin."

Internal structure and particle morphology were evaluated using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), while protein secondary structure was studied using synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD). The GMO cubosome dispersion stabilized by β-casein alone displayed a V(2) (Pn3m) phase structure and a V(2) to H(2) phase transition at 60 °C. In comparison, F127-stabilized GMO dispersion had a V(2) (Im3m) phase structure and the H(2) phase only appeared at higher temperature, that is, 70 °C. In the case of PHYT dispersions, only the V(2) (Pn3m) phase structure was observed irrespective of the type and concentration of stabilizers. However, β-casein-stabilized PHYT dispersion displayed a V(2) to H(2) to L(2) transition behavior upon heating, whereas F127-stabilized PHYT dispersion displayed only a direct V(2) to L(2) transition. The protein secondary structure was not disturbed by interaction with GMO or PHYT cubosomes. The results demonstrate that β-casein provides steric stabilization to dispersions of lipid nanostructured particles and avoids the transition to Im3m structure in GMO cubosomes, but also favors the formation of the H(2) phase, which has implications in drug formulation and delivery applications."
gmos,"Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) could be the answer for many relevant problems affecting crops. However, improving crops through GMO is also often associated with safety concerns, environmental risks and health issues due to the presence of foreign DNA. These limitations have prompted the development of alternative technologies. Recently, cisgenesis and intragenesis have been developed as new tools aimed to modify crops. While cisgenesis involves genetic modification using a complete copy of natural genes with their regulatory elements that belong exclusively to sexually compatible plants, intragenesis refers to the transference of new combinations of genes and regulatory sequences belonging to that particular species. So far, application of cisgenesis and intragenesis as alternatives to conventional transgenesis are limited to a few species, mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the regulatory sequences required. The grape is one of the most cultivated crops worldwide and is the most economically relevant crop in Chile. Its genomic sequence has been completed, making available new sources of information to improve grape traits by genetic manipulation. This review is focused on the current alternatives to transgenesis in plants, including new approaches to develop marker-free crops, their application to economically relevant crops and future perspectives in the area. Also, the identification of grapevine promoters with a wide range of expression profiles is shown. The expression pattern of these genes was analyzed in different tissues and developmental stages, as well as under several stresses and stimuli, giving a broad range of expression patterns, including genes expressed exclusively during ripening, in response to sugars, senescence and biotic stress, among others. Genes with strong and constitutive expression were also identified. Functional analysis using reporter genes has been conducted in order to confirm the promoter's transcription activity, opening new possibilities for developing cisgenic/intragenic grapevines."
gmos,"The objective of this research is to assess the global economic and greenhouse gas emission impacts of banning GMO crops. This is done by modeling two counterfac-tual scenarios and evaluating them apart and in combination using a well-know Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP-BIO. The first scenario models the impact of a global GMO ban. The second scenario models the impact of increased GMO penetration. The focus is on the price and welfare impacts, and land use change greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with GMO technologies. Much of the prior work on the economic impacts of GMO technology has relied on a combination of partial equilibrium analysis and econometric techniques. However, CGE model-ling is a way of analyzing economy-wide impacts that take into account the linkages in the global economy. Here the goal is to contribute to the literature on the benefits of GMO technology by estimating the impacts on price, supply and welfare. Food price impacts range from an increase of 0.27% to 2.2%, depending on the region. Total welfare losses associated with loss of GMO technology total up to $9.75 bil-lion. The loss of GMO traits as an intensification technology has not only economic impacts, but also environmental ones. The full environmental analysis of GMO is not undertaken here. Rather we model the land use change owing to the loss of GMO traits and calculate the associated increase in GHG emissions. We predict a substan-tial increase in GHG emissions if GMO technology is banned."
gmos,"Making sound food and agriculture decisions is important for global society and the environment. Experts tend to view crop genetic engineering, a technology that can improve yields and minimize impacts on the environment, more favorably than the public. Because there is a causal relationship between public opinion and public policy, it is important to understand how opinions about genetically engineered (GE) crops are influenced. The public increasingly seeks science information on the Internet. Here, semantic network analysis is performed to characterize the presentation of the term “GMO (genetically modified organism),” a proxy for food developed from GE crops, on the web. Texts from three sources are analyzed: U.S. federal websites, top pages from a Google search, and online news titles. We found that the framing and sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative attitudes) of “GMO” varies across these sources. It is described how differences in the portrayal of GE food by each source might affect public opinion. A current understanding of the types of information individuals may encounter online can provide insight into public opinion toward GE food. In turn, this knowledge can guide teaching and communication efforts by the scientific community to promote informed decision‐making about agricultural biotechnologies."
gmos,"The study examines the critical factors affecting Chinese social media (SM) users’ intentions and behavior to seek and share information on genetically modified organisms/ genetically modified food (GMO/GMF). The proposed framework was conceptualized through benefit-risk analysis and subsequently mapped SM users’ perceived benefits and risks to seeks and share information using Kurt Lewin’s valence view. Quantitative data was collected using survey questionnaires administered from 583 SM users. The results of the path analysis demonstrated two key findings related to SM users’ perceived benefits and risks to seek and share information on GMO/GMF. Among risks, the psychological risk is the strongest predictor of perceived risk to use SM for GMO/GMF, which consequently determines the intentions and behaviors to share information about GMO/GMF on SM in People’s Republic of China. Among benefits, the results showed that perceived usefulness, creditability of GMO/GMF information, and information support are positively related to perceived benefits to use SM for GMO/GMF, which subsequently, predicts the intentions and behaviors to seek information about GMO/GMF on SM. This study suggests scholars and practitioners explore and utilize the efficient communication strategy to fulfill the potential of the SM to increase GMO/GMF acceptance in Chinese society."

gmos,"ABSTRACT Public concern over genetically modified (GMO) foods has led marketers to promote non-GMO branded foods to consumers. However, factors affecting consumers’ loyalty to non-GMO branded foods are still largely unknown. Building on the product diffusion model, the present research predicts and finds that consumer innovativeness has a positive effect on consumer loyalty to non-GMO foods. In addition, the present research draws from previous research on attitude formation and tests whether cognitive and/or affective beliefs may mediate the relationship between consumer innovativeness and loyalty to non-GMO foods. The results of a parallel multiple mediation model suggest that cognitive, but not affective, beliefs fully mediate the effect of consumer innovativeness on loyalty to non-GMO foods. These results have direct implications for marketers of non-GMO foods and, in general, increase our understanding of the process by which consumer innovativeness may affect consumer loyalty."

gmos,"Seven lines of genetically modified (GM) maize have been authorized in Japan as foods and feeds imported from the USA. We improved a multiplex PCR method described in the previous report in order to distinguish the five lines of GM maize. Genomic DNA was extracted from GM maize with a silica spin column kit, which could reduce experimental time and improve safety in the laboratory and potentially in the environment. We sequenced recombinant DNA (r-DNA) introduced into GM maize, and re-designed new primer pairs to increase the specificity of PCR to distinguish five lines of GM maize by multiplex PCR. A primer pair for the maize intrinsic zein gene (Ze1) was also designed to confirm the presence of amplifiable maize DNA. The lengths of PCR products using these six primer pairs were different. The Ze1 and the r-DNAs from the five lines of GM maize were qualitatively detected in one tube. The specific PCR bands were distinguishable from each other on the basis of the expected length. The r-DNA could be detected from maize samples containing 0.5% of each of the five lines of GM maize. The sensitivity would be acceptable to secure the verification of non-GMO materials and to monitor the reliability of the labeling system."
gmos,"The structure and frictional properties of glycerol monooleate (GMO) in organic solvents, with and without water impurity, confined and sheared between two mica surfaces are examined using molecular dynamics simulations. The structure of the fluid is characterized in various ways, and the differences between systems with nonaggregated GMO and with preformed GMO reverse micelles are examined. Preformed reverse micelles are metastable under static conditions in all systems. In n-heptane under shear conditions, with or without water, preformed GMO reverse micelles remain intact and adsorb onto one surface or another, becoming surface micelles. In dry toluene, preformed reverse micelles break apart under shear, while in the presence of water, the reverse micelles survive and become surface micelles. In all systems under static and shear conditions, nonaggregated GMO adsorbs onto both surfaces with roughly equal probability. Added water is strongly associated with the GMO, irrespective of shear or the form of the added GMO. In all cases, with increasing shear rate, the GMO molecules flatten on the surface, and the kinetic friction coefficient increases. Under low-shear conditions, the friction is insensitive to the form of the GMO added, whereas the presence of water is found to lead to a small reduction in friction. Under high-shear conditions, the presence of reverse micelles leads to a significant reduction in friction, whereas the presence of water increases the friction in n-heptane and decreases the friction in toluene."

gmos,"In order to provide reliable and harmonized information on methods for GMO (genetically modified organism) analysis we have published a database called ""GMOMETHODS"" that supplies information on PCR assays validated according to the principles and requirements of ISO 5725 and/or the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry protocol. In addition, the database contains methods that have been verified by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed in the context of compliance with an European Union legislative act. The web application provides search capabilities to retrieve primers and probes sequence information on the available methods. It further supplies core data required by analytical labs to carry out GM tests and comprises information on the applied reference material and plasmid standards. The GMOMETHODS database currently contains 118 different PCR methods allowing identification of 51 single GM events and 18 taxon-specific genes in a sample. It also provides screening assays for detection of eight different genetic elements commonly used for the development of GMOs. The application is referred to by the Biosafety Clearing House, a global mechanism set up by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to facilitate the exchange of information on Living Modified Organisms. The publication of the GMOMETHODS database can be considered an important step toward worldwide standardization and harmonization in GMO analysis."
gmos,"Abstract This paper provides an overview of the evolution of food labeling in the USA. It briefly describes the three phases of agricultural development consisting of naturally occurring, cross-bred, and genetically engineered, edited or modified crops, otherwise known as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). It uses the Best Available Regulatory Science (BARS) and Metrics for Evaluation of Regulatory Science Claims (MERSC) to evaluate the scientific validity of claims applicable to GMO and the Best Available Public Information (BAPI) to evaluate the pronouncements by public media and others. Subsequently claims on health risk, ecological risk, consumer choice, and corporate greed are evaluated based on BARS/MERSC and BAPI. The paper concludes by suggesting that labeling of food containing GMO should consider the consumer’s choice, such as the food used by those who desire kosher and halal food. Furthermore, the consumer choice is already met by the exclusion of GMO in organic food."
gmos,"Genetic knowledge applicable to crop improvement has erupted over the past 60 years, and the techniques of introducing genes from one organism to another have enabled new varieties of crops not achievable by previously available methodologies of crop breeding. Research and particularly development of these GMO-crops to a point where they are useful for growers and consumers in most countries is subject to complex national and international rules arising out of the UN's Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, with 167 country signatories. (The USA and Canada are not signatories.) The Protocol was developed based on concerns initially expressed in the 1970's that such technology presented unusual risks to man and the environment. Those ideas have comprehensively and authoritatively been proven to be wrong. The Protocol has nevertheless spawned significant regulatory obstacles to the development of GMO-crop technology at great cost to global society and in conflict with many other UN objectives. The suspicion induced by the Protocol is also widely used, overtly or covertly, for political purposes. These points are illustrated by reference to the not-for-profit Golden Rice project."

gmos,"Lyotropic liquid crystalline dispersions, such as cubosomes, have been proposed as potential drug delivery vehicles. A recently described ‘salt induced’ method of cubosome production may be suitable for the encapsulation of macromolecular bioactive therapeutics, such as proteins, within the cubic phase. Here, we develop and characterise glycerol-monoolein (GMO)-based cubosomes using this novel method of cubosome production. Using the anionic biological lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine (DPPS) to prevent GMO from forming its natural cubic-phase, we validate that addition of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) can be used to reverse the effects of DPPS. However, this transition is dependent on the type of Pluronic® block copolymer stabiliser used to prevent re-flocculation of the cubosome dispersions. Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, we show that the ‘salt induced’ phase transition, from small unilamellar vesicles to cubosomes, is inhibited when using Pluronic® F127. In contrast, using the larger, more hydrophilic stabiliser Pluronic® F108, cubosomes can be formed, although further analysis using SAXS suggests these GMO-based cubosomes are less thermally stable than those comprising GMO alone. In addition, we find no significant difference in the in vitro cytotoxicity of cubosome dispersions formed using either of these stabilisers, or between those containing DPPS and those without. The ability to control cubic phase transitions may present an opportunity for the incorporation of therapeutically relevant proteins in these nanoparticles."

The high charge density (due to MVL5) and positive Gaussian modulus of the GMO-containing membranes confer optimal electrostatic and elastic properties for endosomal escape, enabling efficient siRNA delivery and effective, specific gene silencing."

Eur. Communities 2001, L1 06/2). In this work, four different methods for DNA extraction were evaluated and compared. To rank the different methods, the quality and quantity of DNA extracted from standards, containing known percentages of GMO material and from different food products, were considered. The food products analyzed derived from both soybean and maize and were chosen on the basis of the mechanical, technological, and chemical treatment they had been subjected to during processing. Degree of DNA degradation at various stages of food production was evaluated through the amplification of different DNA fragments belonging to the endogenous genes of both maize and soybean. Genomic DNA was extracted from Roundup Ready soybean and maize MON810 standard flours, according to four different methods, and quantified by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), with the aim of determining the influence of the extraction methods on the DNA quantification through real-time PCR."

They have been developed in four independent laboratories targeting different maize sequences, i.e., alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1), high mobility group protein (hmga), invertase A (ivr1), and zein, respectively. They were all fully specific, showing a very similar quantification accuracy along a number of distantly related maize cultivars and being either single or low copy number genes. They were highly sensitive and exhibited limits of quantification below 100 maize genomic copies. In consequence, they are considered suitable for use as maize specific endogenous reference genes in DNA analyses, including GMO quantitative tests."

In our experiments, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with its higher efficiency than PCR was performed at a constant temperature (65 degrees C). Amplification products were combined with a redox active molecule Hoechst 33258 [H33258, 2'-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2,5'-bi(1H-benzimidazole)] and analyzed by a DNA stick (DS) which is integrated with a disposable electrochemical printed (DEP) chip using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The DNA minor groove binding of the H33258 molecule causes a significant drop in the peak current intensity of the H33258 oxidation. The phenomenon of DNA binding induced by H33258, in addition to changes in the anodic current peak, was used to detect maize CBH 351 variety (StarLink). Since laborious probe immobilization was not required, and amplification and detection were performed on a single device, our biosensor eliminates potential cross-contamination. We believe that this type of sensor will have an unprecedented impact for environmental protection."

gmos,The purpose of this study was to develop an ophthalmic drug delivery system for cyclosporine A (CsA) based on glyceryl monooleate (GMO)/poloxamer 407 liquid crystalline nanoparticles with reduced ocular irritancy and improved corneal penetration. CsA-loaded liquid crystalline nanoparticles were prepared via fragmentation of a bulk GMO/poloxamer 407 cubic phase gel by high-pressure homogenization and characterized. Corneal permeation and retention was evaluated using modified Franz diffusing cells. Intra-corneal transportation was investigated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled liquid crystalline nanoparticles. Ocular irritation was then evaluated using the Draize method. The mean particle size of liquid crystalline nanoparticles was 193.5 nm and the entrapment efficiency was 95.11 ± 0.67%. A bicontinuous cubic phase of cubic P-type was determined using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) observation and small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) analysis. A 1.52-fold increase in Js and a 2.2-fold increase in corneal retention was achieved by liquid crystalline nanoparticles compared with oil solution. In vitro corneal permeation investigated with FITC-labeled liquid crystalline nanoparticles revealed that CsA penetrated across the cornea under the transportation of liquid crystalline nanoparticles. Liquid crystalline nanoparticles exhibited excellent ocular tolerance in the ocular irritation test. This low-irritant vehicle based on liquid crystalline nanoparticles might be a promising system for effective ocular CsA delivery.

Using an online survey in conjunction with a Tobit model we find that half of students in our sample are willing to pay more for increased local and organic food options with only a third willing to pay more for increased non-GMO options. The economic feasibility of adding new local, organic, and non-GMO options is questionable as charging students for their willingness to pay results in only a 1â€“2% gain in revenue which may not cover the cost of more options in on-campus dining halls."
gmos,"Since the late 1990s, the European Union (EU) has embarked on an effort to make fully traceable and identifiable every genetically modified organism (GMO) that travels through its territory. New regulations force market operators to record the presence of genetically modified material in foods and feed, and to pass this information along in every transaction, thus creating a continuous paper trail for every bioengineered organism as it moves through the EU market. This new regulatory regime represents a momentous change in the nature of biotechnology governance in Europe, for it enunciates as its fundamental unit a novel bio-legal entity - the ‘transformation event’ meant to identify the particular instance of genetic modification from which each GMO has been developed. This paper describes the processes through which this new regulatory entity acquires a concrete and material meaning and thereby becomes a viable object of governance. Two parallel developments are described in detail: the creation of international rules for attributing to ‘transformation events’ unambiguous names - an instance of ‘bureaucratic nominalism’ - and the creation of detection methods and biometrological chains of custody capable of identifying the fragments of DNA that mark the specificity of each ‘event’. These two interventions involve the creation of infrastructures of referentiality capable of giving the ‘event’ a singular and unambiguous referent. By analysing how a new regulatory category like the ‘transformation event’ becomes an identifiable bio-legal object, I suggest that the governance of biotechnology should be understood as a series of acts of ‘demarcation’, through which the categories and entities enunciated in regulatory texts acquire a material foundation in bureaucratic practices and in the organisms these bureaucracies are expected to oversee."
gmos,"This chapter provides a review of the various in situ and ex situ bioremediation technologies and the situations to which they are applicable. As many as 2 billion people rely directly on aquifers for drinking water, and 40% of the world’s food is produced by irrigated agriculture that relies largely on groundwater. Two technologies - biopiles and windrow composting - currently dominate the ex situ bioremediation market for treatment of contaminated soils. Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) have traditionally been designed as chemical and physical intervention techniques, with incidental biodegradation taking place, and it is only recently that deliberately turning PRBs into bioremediation technology has arisen. Even materials such as garden waste provide extra microbial communities, even though that is not the primary function in the bioremediation, which is normally to provide heat-generating materials during composting. A variety of genetically modified organism (GMO) that have been designed for bioremediation are still at the laboratory or early field test stage, but there is optimism that in the future, GMOs will be used for bioremediation, targeting most recalcitrant pollutants in inhospitable environments at relatively low cost. Delivery of bioaugmentation cultures in an immobilized form may offer more complete and/or more rapid degradation. The longer-term success of bioremediation may well depend upon developing in situ treatments that can greatly accelerate the rates of degradation of contaminants, especially in groundwater, in a predictable and cost-effective manner."

The specificity and sensitivity of the array were evaluated. A comparative analysis with the data and publicly available information on GM crops approved in Japan allowed us to assume the possibility of unapproved GM crop contamination.

gmos,"Silymarin, a mixture of flavonolignans extracted from the seeds of milk thistle, is used clinically as a hepatoprotector to treat liver injuries and chronic hepatitis. However, its therapeutic effect is compromised by its poor oral bioavailability due to the poor solubility and low permeability across intestinal epithelia. The main purpose of this study was to prepare silymarin glyceryl monooleate/poloxamer 407 liquid crystalline matrices (GMO/P407 LCM) to improve the oral bioavailability of silymarin. GMO/P407 LCMs were prepared by a melting/congealing method. The isotropic phenomenon observed under polarized light microscope confirmed the liquid crystalline structure at the junction of LCM and water. Both differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed disappearance of silymarin crystallinity after incorporation into the LCMs. In vitro release of silymarin from LCMs was limited, whereas LCMs were readily degraded by lipase and released silymarin quickly and completely. Pharmacokinetic study in beagle dogs showed significantly increased peak concentration for silymarin GMO/P407 LCM, and, most importantly, a 3.46-fold increase in oral bioavailability as compared with Legalon®, a commercial silymarin formulation."

In particular, consumers are asking for the labeling of food derived from genetically modified organisms (GMO) based on health, safety, and environmental concerns. At issue is whether the labels that are sought would accurately provide the information desired. The present study examined consumer (n = 181) perceptions of health, safety and the environment for foods labeled organic, natural, fat free or low fat, GMO, or non-GMO. Findings indicated that respondents consistently believed that foods labeled GMO are less healthy, safe and environmentally-friendly compared to all other labels (ps < .05). These results suggest that labels mean something to consumers, but that a disconnect may exist between the meaning associated with the label and the scientific consensus for GMO food. These findings may provide insight for the development of labels that provide information that consumers seek."
gmos,"The high internal surface area and drug solubilizing capacity of liquid crystal lipids makes them promising oral drug delivery systems. Pluronic F127 is typically used to disperse highly viscous cubic liquid crystal lipids into cubosomes; however, such copolymers alter the internal structure and provide little control over enzymatic digestion. This study aimed to use hydrophilic silica nanoparticles to stabilize glyceryl monooleate (GMO) cubosomes prepared by ultrasonication. We investigate the influence of silica nanoparticles size and concentration on the physical (colloidal) and chemical (enzymatic digestion) stability, as well as in vitro solubilization of cinnarizine as a poorly soluble model drug. Silica stabilized nanostructured liquid crystal dispersions (120 nm to150 nm in diameter and zeta potentials of-30 mV to -60 mV) were successfully prepared with excellent long-term stability (<10% size change after 30 days). Silica stabilized GMO cubosomes demonstrated reduced enzymatic digestion compared to pluronic F127 stabilized cubosomes. This reduced digestion was attributed to a combination of adsorbed silica nanoparticles acting as a physical barrier and excess dispersed silica adsorbing/scavenging the lipase enzyme. Under simulated intestinal digestion conditions, silica stabilized GMO cubosomes showed a greater solubilization capacity for cinnarizine, which precipitated in non-crystalline form, in comparison to pure drug suspensions or pluronic F127 stabilized GMO cubosomes. Silica nanoparticle stabilized GMO liquid crystal dispersions are a promising oral delivery vehicle."

The delivery of an encapsulated hydrophobic model herbicide [dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)] was also examined on the model and real leaf surfaces. The adsorption behavior of the particles by ATR-FTIR was dependent on the internal nanostructure and lipid composition, with PHYT cubosomes adsorbing more avidly at tristearin surfaces than GMO-based cubosomes or hexosomes. There was a direct correlation between DDE associated with the surfaces and the particle adsorption observed in the ATR-FTIR study, strongly implicating particle adsorption with the delivery efficiency. Differences between the mode of interaction of the Pluronic stabilizer with the different lipids and particle nanostructures were proposed to lead to differences in the particle adsorption behavior."
gmos,"Abstract Objective: We investigated the potential effects of oleic acid (OA) and glycerol monooleate (GMO) on the skin delivery of CXB. Methods: The influence of both OA and GMO (5.0% or 10.0%) on the in vitro skin permeability of CXB (2.0%) was evaluated using propylene glycol (PG) as a vehicle. Also the in vitro potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity and in vivo assays (skin irritation in rabbits and topical anti-inflammatory activity by in mice) were conducted. Results: As expected, the amount of CXB that permeated through the skin was minimal, but drug retention on the viable skin (epidermis plus dermis) was higher in association with treatment with 5.0% OA or GMO compared to the control treatment, meaning that there was a localized effect of CXB in the skin. No formulation presented cytotoxic or genotoxic potential, suggesting safety for cutaneous application. In vivo skin irritation assays indicated that no formulation was irritating to the skin becomes its use possible for a prolonged time. In vivo anti-inflammatory experiments indicated that both edema and protein extravasation were inhibited with a maximum % inhibition of 53.5.0% and 61.0% for 5.0 % GMO, respectively, and 48.0% and 35.5% for 5.0% OA, respectively. Such formulations were able to inhibit around twofold the percentage of ear edema in mice compared to a commercial product reference diclofenac commercial formula. Conclusion: There is no topical formulation currently available that contains both CXB and 5.0% GMO or OA, suggesting them as potential adjuvants that improve the skin delivery of CXB."
gmos,"Tempe merupakan produk olahan fermentasi kedelai asli Indonesia. Telah diketahui bahwa kandungan gizi tempe lebih baik dibandingkan kedelai yang tidak difermentasi. Masalah utama tempe adalah umur simpan yang relatif rendah. Salah satu alternatif pengolahan tempe adalah tepung tempe. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengevaluasi kualitas protein tepung tempe yang terbuat dari kedelai impor dan lokal. Penelitian ini menggunakan tikus putih Sprague-Dawley sebagai hewan model. Tikus dibagi 4 kelompok berdasarkan sumber protein dalam ransum, yaitu tepung tempe kedelai impor Genetically Modified Organism (GMO)/hasil rekayasa genetika, tepung tempe kedelai impor non-GMO, tepung tempe kedelai lokal Grobogan, dan kasein sebagai kontrol. Parameter kualitas protein diukur berdasarkan metode pertumbuhan dan metode keseimbangan nitrogen. Hasil analisis menunjukkan tidak terdapat perbedaan yang nyata pada nilai food convertion efficiency (FCE), protein efficiency ratio (PER), dan net protein ratio (NPR) dari semua jenis tepung tempe. Nilai true protein digestibility (TPD) tepung tempe kedelai grobogan dan non-GMO tidak berbeda nyata, namun nyata lebih tinggi dari tepung tempe kedelai GMO, dan lebih rendah dari kasein. Tidak terdapat perbedaan yang nyata pada nilai biological value (BV) dan net protein utilization (NPU) semua sampel. Dari penelitian ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa secara umum nilai gizi protein tepung tempe kedelai lokal Grobogan tidak berbeda dengan tepung tempe kedelai impor non-GMO. Tempe is a fermented soybean product from Indonesia. It has been known that nutritional values of tempe are better than unfermented soybean. The main problem of tempe product is its short shelf life. An alternative way to solve this problem is tempe flour. The objective of this research was to evaluate the protein nutritional quality of tempe flours made from imported and local soybeans. This research used albino Sprague-Dawley rats as an animal model. The rats were divided into 4 groups based on protein source of the diet, namely: tempe flour of imported Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) soybean, tempe flour of imported non-GMO soybean, tempe flour of local Grobogan soybean, and casein as a control. Protein nutritional parameters were observed based on growth of rats and nitrogen balance methods. The results showed that there were no significant different of food conversion efficiency (FCE), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and net protein ratio (NPR) values from all of tempe flours. True protein digestibility (TPD) value of Grobogan and non-GMO tempe flours was not different, but higher than GMO soybean tempe flour, and lower than casein. There were no significant different of biological value (BV) and net protein utilization (NPU) values from all samples. This research concluded that generally the nutritional quality of protein of tempe flour from local Grobogan soybean tempe flour was not different from the protein quality of import non-GMOZT."
gmos,"With the development of genetically modified organism (GMO) detection techniques, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique has been the mainstay for GMO detection, and real-time PCR is the most effective and important method for GMO quantification. An event-specific detection strategy based on the unique and specific integration junction sequences between the host plant genome DNA and the integrated gene is being developed for its high specificity. This study establishes the event-specific detection methods for TC1507 and CBH351 maizes. In addition, the event-specific TaqMan real-time PCR detection methods for another seven GM maize events (Bt11, Bt176, GA21, MON810, MON863, NK603, and T25) were systematically optimized and developed. In these PCR assays, the fluorescent quencher, TAMRA, was dyed on the T-base of the probe at the internal position to improve the intensity of the fluorescent signal. To overcome the difficulties in obtaining the certified reference materials of these GM maizes, one novel standard reference molecule containing all nine specific integration junction sequences of these GM maizes and the maize endogenous reference gene, zSSIIb, was constructed and used for quantitative analysis. The limits of detection of these methods were 20 copies for these different GM maizes, the limits of quantitation were about 20 copies, and the dynamic ranges for quantification were from 0.05 to 100% in 100 ng of DNA template. Furthermore, nine groups of the mixed maize samples of these nine GM maize events were quantitatively analyzed to evaluate the accuracy and precision. The accuracy expressed as bias varied from 0.67 to 28.00% for the nine tested groups of GM maize samples, and the precision expressed as relative standard deviations was from 0.83 to 26.20%. All of these indicated that the established event-specific real-time PCR detection systems and the reference molecule in this study are suitable for the identification and quantification of these GM maizes."
gmos,"During the last few years, animal nutrition has been confronted with genetically modified organisms (GMO), and their significance will increase in the future. The study presents investigations on the substantial equivalence of the transgenic Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) corn and the corresponding nontransgenic hybrid Cesar and parameters of nutrition physiology such as digestibility and energy content for poultry, pigs and ruminants. The results of the analysed corn samples as well as of the silage samples illustrated substantial equivalence in all investigated ingredients, such as crude nutrients, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals and non‐starch polysaccharides. The results of the experiments using poultry, pigs, wethers and fattening bulls were not influenced by the genetic modification of corn. The determined values for the digestibilities and the energy contents for poultry, pigs and wethers were not affected by the used corn variety. Neither the examined parameters of the fattening experiments with bulls nor the slaughter results showed any significant differences between the bulls fed on silages made from the nontransgenic or transgenic corn."
gmos,"The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay indicates a potential and valuable means for genetically modified organism (GMO) detection especially for its rapidity, simplicity, and low cost. We developed and evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of the LAMP method for rapid detection of the genetically modified (GM) maize T25. A set of six specific primers was successfully designed to recognize six distinct sequences on the target gene, including a pair of inner primers, a pair of outer primers, and a pair of loop primers. The optimum reaction temperature and time were verified to be 65°C and 45 min, respectively. The detection limit of this LAMP assay was 5 g kg−1 GMO component. Comparative experiments showed that the LAMP assay was a simple, rapid, accurate, and specific method for detecting the GM maize T25."
gmos,"This opinion provides guidance in the area of comparators taking into account the requirements for the molecular characterisation, the food and feed and the environmental risk assessments. A key step in the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants and derived food and feed is the identification of intended and unintended differences and equivalences between the GM plant and its comparator(s), taking into account the range of natural variation. In line with Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and Directive 2001/18/EC, the EFSA GMO Panel has, to date, required the use of non-GM lines with comparable genetic background as comparators. In the case of vegetatively propagated crops, these are the isogenic lines. In the case of sexually propagated crops these are non-GM lines as close as possible genetically to the GM plant under assessment. The identification and production of such comparators is becoming increasingly challenging due to the increasing complexity of GM plants, e.g. those developed by combining (stacking) events through conventional crosses, or those in which extensive compositional changes are targeted. Consequently, the EFSA GMO Panel has developed this guidance on the selection of comparators for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed. Whilst considering the requirements of Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the EFSA GMO Panel provides options which introduce flexibility in the selection of comparators based on sound scientific principles. This document addresses the selection of comparators for GM plants containing single or multiple events stacked by either conventional breeding, or by other approaches such as re-transformation, co-transformation and the use of multiple gene cassettes. The EFSA GMO Panel also considers situations where additional comparators may be required on a case-by-case basis and scenarios where appropriate comparators are not available (e.g. where extensive compositional changes are targeted). The EFSA GMO Panel recognises the different requirements for comparators for the molecular characterisation, food and feed and environmental components of the risk assessment."
gmos,"This paper empirically examines whether GMO policies are “trade related” for countries in Latin America (LA). First, we use the Balassa index to assess the “revealed comparative advantage” of LA countries. We find that LA countries have a revealed comparative advantage in GMO industries relative to the world, and that intra‐regional trade in these industries is modest relative to external trade. Second, we estimate the Gravity model to examine the effects of importers’ GMO policies on Argentina and Brazil's bilateral exports of soybeans and maize. We find that strong GMO policies in importers have a negative effect on Argentina's bilateral exports of soybeans (an industry and country with historically high GMO content). Further, we find that past GMO policies are a strong determinant of Argentina's future bilateral exports, and that the negative trade effects of strong GMO policies are increasing over time. In contrast, we find a weaker relationship between the GMO policies of importers and Brazil's bilateral exports (consistent with Brazil's more recent increases in GMO content). These findings for Argentina and Brazil provide a benchmark for other developing countries that are looking for guidance on servicing trading partners with diverse GMO policies."
gmos,"ABSTRACT The Chinese corn futures market is the second largest after the CBOT in terms of trading volume in contracts. In 2012, the trading volume of corn futures was 37 million contracts (or 378 million metric tons). The relationship between Chinese corn futures and spot prices is studied to gauge the price discovery process. Formal statistical tests are conducted based on Johansen's co‐integration, Granger causality and the Garbade‐Silber approach for the corn spot prices and futures prices. All empirical analysis is also performed for GMO and non‐GMO soybeans to provide a contrast with the corn futures market. The results suggest that Chinese corn futures prices guide the spot prices; that is, the corn futures market can serve as legitimate guide for future cash prices. This conclusion is valid for GMO futures market, but is not found to be the case for non‐GMO soybeans, where spot prices guide futures prices."

gmos,"Agriculture has changed from an art to a precision science using high yielding and disease resistant genetically modified (GMO*) crop. Though GMO crops provide high yields they are very sensitive to other factors like timely irrigation, nutrient constitution of the soil etc. So it is important that these parameters are periodically monitored to ensure their proper yield. It is easy to monitor these parameters in a small field of an acre or less but it becomes almost next to impossible to consistently monitor them in large holdings of land. UAVs provide a fast and efficient method of analyzing field conditions in large land holdings."
gmos,"Diamond‐like carbon (DLC) films are gaining attention for its use in a wide range of tribological applications because of their low friction coefficient and high wear resistance. Recently, ultra‐low friction or superlubricity as low as 0.006 has been observed between hydrogen‐free DLC films lubricated with oil containing a glycerol mono‐oleate (GMO) additive. Consequently, there are many efforts to understand their detailed tribological behaviour. In this study, first, a characterisation of a pristine hydrogen‐free tetrahedral amorphous DLC coating (denoted as ta‐C) is presented. The technique used for ta‐C characterisation is the energy‐filtered transmission electron microscopy studied on a focus ion beam cross section of the coating. Then, to simulate the action of GMO, which is used as an additive in engine oils, and to understand its mechanism of action in boundary lubrication conditions, simple and shorter molecules such as pure glycerol and hydrogen peroxide are used in friction tests. These two molecules and GMO have the same alcohol chemical function. Friction tests in the presence of pure glycerol and hydrogen peroxide are presented. Moreover, to understand the properties of these two molecules, the overtone of GMO and their reaction mechanism in boundary lubrication, liquid phase lubrication was simulated by gas phase lubrication. Results show that very low friction coefficients are obtained with no apparent wear. Finally, the mechanisms of ultra‐low friction are investigated by the wetting method and the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. These two techniques are used to identify the physical (wetting method) and chemical (XPS) changes occurring at the ta‐C surface after friction. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
gmos,A generalized molecular orbital (GMO) theory for magnetically interacting organic compounds has been presented. The theory is applied to the calculations of the effective exchange integrals (Jab) for the cyclophane-type carbene dimers whose para and ortho-isomers have the high-spin ground state. The calculated Jab-values are consistent with observations.
gmos,"Feral populations of crop species along roadsides contribute to the uncertainty regarding the containment of genetically modified (GM) crops, as the feral populations could promote the persistence of transgenes outside of cultivated fields. Roadside populations of several common crop species are known to occur far from arable fields, and the dispersal pathways that promote their recruitment in road verges are unclear. Human-aided dispersal, in particular adhesive dispersal by vehicles, has been suggested as a possible vector, but this has not yet been proven experimentally. We sampled the seed rain from vehicles inside two motorway tunnels in an urban environment to reveal the contribution of crop species to seeds unintentionally dispersed by traffic beyond agricultural production areas. Three species of arable crops, wheat Triticum aestivum, rye Secale cereale and oilseed rape Brassica napus, were among the most frequent species deposited by vehicles inside the motorway tunnels. Each of the three species was clearly more predominant in one direction of traffic. While seeds of Triticum aestivum and Secale cereale were primarily transported into the city, Brassica napus was significantly more abundant in samples from lanes leading out of the city. Seed sources in the local surroundings of the tunnels were virtually nonexistent, and the high magnitude of seed deposition combined with high seed weights suggests a dispersal mechanism different from other species in the sample, at least for Triticum aestivum and Secale cereale. This provides evidence that spillage during transport is a major driver for long-distance dispersal of crops. Our results suggest that seed dispersal by vehicles is the major driver in the recruitment of roadside populations of arable crops, providing a possible escape route for GM crops. Risk management should thus aim at curbing transport losses of GM crops."
gmos,"Inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by painful and destructive inflammatory flares of a single joint, mainly in the back, the knees, the wrists or the hips. Monoarthritis is generally treated by intraarticular (IA) injections of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid (HA). However, due to their toxicity, the chronic use of corticosteroids should be avoided. The aim of this work was to develop a new slow-release formulation for a parenteral route of administration (e.g., IA). The development’s strategy was based on the use of amphiphilic ingredients such as glyceryl monooleate (GMO), which is able to generate viscous crystalline phase structures upon contact with an aqueous fluid (e.g., synovial fluid) to sustain the drug activity over weeks. Clonidine (CLO) was suggested as a small and hydrophilic model drug and HA as a hydrophilic viscoelastic scaffold. Thermal analyses showed that the stability of GMO, HA, and CLO in mixtures with a ratio of 1:1 (wt/wt) was not affected in comparison with the raw materials. In order to obtain a formulation presenting suitable syringeability and containing GMO, CLO, and HA, two elements were found to be essential: a minimum of about 15% (wt/wt) water content and the use of co-solvents such as ethanol (ET) and propylene glycol (PG), approved by the FDA for parenteral use. Several developed gels presented pseudoplastic flow behavior. Moreover, the best composition provided an in vitro release of CLO for about 1 week that was similar to a cubic reference formulation, described by many authors as presenting poor syringeability but the best sustained-release capacity."
gmos,"Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA GMO Panel) assessed the post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) report for the 2012 growing season of maize MON 810 provided by Monsanto Europe S.A. The EFSA GMO Panel noted that the applicant used a similar methodology as the one previously established for monitoring maize MON 810 in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The EFSA GMO Panel therefore focused its assessment on the novel datasets specific to the 2012 growing season of maize MON 810, and not on the methodology. The data submitted by the applicant in its 2012 PMEM report do not indicate any adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment arising from maize MON 810 cultivation in 2012. However, having already highlighted the poor sensitivity of the methodology followed by the applicant, the EFSA GMO Panel strongly reiterates its previous recommendations for the improvement of the methodology. In addition, the EFSA GMO Panel recommends that the applicant: (1) further investigates effects observed during the monitoring of baseline susceptibility of target pests in Spain; (2) follow-up possible adverse effects of maize MON 810 on rove beetles."
gmos,"The geometries and electronic characteristics of the graphene monoxide (GMO) bilayer are predicted via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. All the possible sequences of the GMO bilayer show the typical interlayer bonding characteristics of two-dimensional bilayer systems with a weak van der Waals interaction. The band gap energies of the GMO bilayers are predicted to be adequate for electronic device application, indicating slightly smaller energy gaps (0.418-0.448 eV) compared to the energy gap of the monolayer (0.536 eV). Above all, in light of the band gap engineering, the band gap of the GMO bilayer responds to the external electric field sensitively. As a result, a semiconductor-metal transition occurs at a small critical electric field (EC = 0.22-0.30 V/Å). It is therefore confirmed that the GMO bilayer is a strong candidate for nanoelectronics."
gmos,"The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asked the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms to establish a self-tasking Working Group with the aim of (1) producing a scientific review of the current guidance of the GMO Panel for Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA), focusing on the potential impacts of GM plants on Non-Target Organisms (NTOs), (2) proposing criteria for NTOs selection, and (3) providing advise on standardized testing methodology. This initiative was undertaken in response to a need and request from a wide range of stakeholders, including the European Commission and Member States. In first instance, the self-tasking Working Group on Non-Target Organisms (EFSA NTO WG) mainly considered impacts of GM plants on invertebrate species, but also took account of ecosystem functions that could be altered. The EFSA NTO WG considered the necessity for clear and objective protection goals, for which assessment and measurement endpoints shall be developed; the need to initiate the scientific risk assessment by setting testable hypotheses; criteria for appropriate selection of test species and ecological functional groups; appropriate laboratory and field studies to collect relevant NTO data; and the use of statistical techniques that should be an integral part of experimental design. The EFSA NTO WG considered the range of approaches and methodologies of ERA of NTOs as described in the current literature and proposed risk assessment approaches based on selection of functional groups and individual species within a tiered approach. The present scientific opinion provides guidance to risk assessors for assessing potential effects of GM plants on NTOs, together with rationale for data requirements in order to complete a comprehensive ERA for NTOs. In this respect, guidance to applicants as outlined in the present opinion has been inserted in the updated Guidance Document of the EFSA GMO Panel for the ERA of GM plants."

gmos,"The recent success in synthesizing graphene monoxide (GMO) with rigorous stoichiometric ratio C:O = 1:1 has highlighted the need to determine its ground state geometry and to explore its physical properties. Using density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation, we have found a new ether-type configuration of the GMO that is not only lower in energy than any other structures reported thus far, but is also stable up to 2000 K at which previous reported structures dissociate into CO molecules. The dynamic stability of the structure is further confirmed by calculating its phonon spectra. Furthermore, this ether-type structure exhibits anisotropies in mechanical stiffness and in electronic transport. Band gap, carrier concentration, and effective mass can be sensitively modulated by strain or higher oxidation level with C:O = 1:2. This study provides new theoretical insights into geometry, stability, and properties of the hotly pursued graphene oxide with unprecedented applications."
gmos,"With the increasing development of genetically modified organism (GMO) detection techniques, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has been the mainstay for GMO detection. An oligonucleotide microarray is a glass chip to the surface of which an array of oligonucleotides was fixed as spots, each containing numerous copies of a sequence-specific probe that is complementary to a gene of interest. So it is used to detect ten or more targets synchronously. In this research, an event-specific detection strategy based on the unique and specific integration junction sequences between the host plant genome DNA and the integrated gene is being developed for its high specificity using multiplex-PCR together with oligonucleotide microarray. A commercial GM soybean (GTS 40-3-2) and six GM maize events (MON810, MON863, Bt176, Bt11, GA21, and T25) were detected by this method. The results indicate that it is a suitable method for the identification of these GM soybean and maizes."
gmos,"Milling fractions from conventional and transgenic corn were prepared at laboratory scale and used to study the influence of sample composition and heat-induced DNA degradation on the relative quantification of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in food products. Particle size distributions of the obtained fractions (coarse grits, regular grits, meal, and flour) were characterized using a laser diffraction system. The application of two DNA isolation protocols revealed a strong correlation between the degree of comminution of the milling fractions and the DNA yield in the extracts. Mixtures of milling fractions from conventional and transgenic material (1%) were prepared and analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Accurate quantification of the adjusted GMO content was only possible in mixtures containing conventional and transgenic material in the form of analogous milling fractions, whereas mixtures of fractions exhibiting different particle size distributions delivered significantly over- and underestimated GMO contents depending on their compositions. The process of heat-induced nucleic acid degradation was followed by applying two established quantitative assays showing differences between the lengths of the recombinant and reference target sequences (A, deltal(A) = -25 bp; B, deltal(B) = +16 bp; values related to the amplicon length of the reference gene). Data obtained by the application of method A resulted in underestimated recoveries of GMO contents in the samples of heat-treated products, reflecting the favored degradation of the longer target sequence used for the detection of the transgene. In contrast, data yielded by the application of method B resulted in increasingly overestimated recoveries of GMO contents. The results show how commonly used food technological processes may lead to distortions in the results of quantitative GMO analyses."
gmos,"We demonstrate the utility of gold nano-particles (AuNPs) as the basis of a stand-alone, inexpensive, and sensitive mercury monitor. Gold nanoparticles absorb visible light due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and the absorbance changes when mercury combines with the gold nanoparticles. The sensitivity of the peak absorbance is proportional to the surface-area-to-volume ratio. We chose 5 nm spheres because they have the largest surface-area-to-volume ratio while still having a peak absorption in the visible range. The adsorption of 15 atoms of Hg causes a 1 nm shift in the LSPR wavelength of these particles. Assembled into a film using the Langmuir−Blodgett method, the AuNP LSPR can be tracked with a simple UV−vis spectrometer. The rate of shift in the peak absorbance is linear with mercury concentrations from 1 to 825 μg Hg /m air 3. Increasing the flow velocity (and mass transfer rate) increases the peak shift rate making this system a viable method for direct ambient mercury vapor measurements. Regeneration of the sensing films, done by heating to 160 °C, allows for repeatable measurements on the same film. ■ INTRODUCTION Mercury, a neurotoxic global pollutant, demands global regulation. The long lifetime of mercury in the atmosphere (>1 year) allows long-range transport limiting local emission controls from protecting all environments. Policy makers are working toward a worldwide effort similar to the sulfur dioxide or CFC regulations of the 20th century. Anticipating a global policy, the European Commission began a five-year project in 2010 called the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS, www.gmos.eu) to create a coordinated global network adequate for improving models and making policy recommendations. The new system expands on the regional efforts made in North America (i.e., the Mercury Deposit Network and North American Airborne Mercury Experiment) and the independent observations made around the world. A preliminary assessment by GMOS points to gaps in emissions monitoring and in the spatial coverage of environmental observations, mostly in the southern hemisphere. Lack of an inexpensive, stand-alone, low-power, low-maintenance sensor is a primary technical issue confronting the GMOS. Current air monitors are amply sensitive to detect the global background (1.2 ng/m 3) but are costly and high maintenance. 1 Preconcentration of trace mercury vapor samples is required for ambient measurements and depends on gold surfaces to effectively trap and quickly release mercury in detectable amounts. Concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/m 3 can be analyzed using a trap made of gold-coated …"
gmos,"In the past three years, the growth rate has slowed for acres planted with genetically modified (GM) crops globally, in contrast to its rapid increase in the late 1990s (James, 2002). This slowdown may be due to worldwide conflicting views on biotechnology that not only affect global investment in the biotechnology industry, but also impact farmers adoption of this technology. Some, but not all, of these issues are present in China; however, Chinas development of its biotechnology industry has been unique, catalyzed by the active involvement of the public sector. A survey of Chinas plant biotechnologists by the authors and their collaborators in 2000 shows that China is developing the largest plant biotechnology capacity outside of North America (Huang, Rozelle, Pray, & Wang, 2002). In 1997, when the National Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Biosafety Committee was established, this committee immediately approved 46 cases for field trials, environmental release, and commercialization, which covered 12 GM crops. Among them three cases of cotton, tomato, and petunia were approved for commercialization in certain locations (Huang, Wang, & Keeley, 2001).1 A number of earlier studies concluded that China adopted a promotional policy to embrace the benefits of biotechnology (Chen, 2000; Huang, Wang, Zhang, & Zepeda, 2001; Paarlberg, 2000). China became one of the worlds leading countries in biotechnology development. China also received criticism from biotechnology opponents for not paying enough attention to biosafety, the environment, consumer and food safety, and the potential impacts of biotechnology on Chinas future agricultural trade position. However, the above perceptions regarding Chinas position on agricultural biotechnology lasted for only a few years. In May 2001, Chinas State Council decreed a new ruleRegulation on Safety Administration of Agricultural GMOs. And in early 2002, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) issued three detailed regulations on the biosafety management, trade and labeling of GM farm products.2 After these events, China received more criticism than support from both proponents and critics of biotechnology. For example, biotech scientists and biotech industry representatives criticized Chinas new regulations as too restrictive to provide a favorable environment for the development of biotechnology. They called the period following 1999 as the winter of biotechnology. Alternatively, Greenpeace and environmental agencies continuously warned China of the potential risks associated with GMOs. International trade impacts occurred for both imports and exports. New regulations required importers of GM agricultural products to apply for official safety verification approval from Chinas Ministry of Agriculture. This led the US government to accuse Beijing of using these new rules to hinder imports and protect Chinese soybean farmers.3 Pressure was also raised on the export side. China was frequently asked to certify that its agricultural exports to Japan and EU markets were free of GMOs. In addition, there has been growing criticism of Chinas financial and institutional ability to label its GM farm products."
gmos,"The environmental risk associated with genetically modified organisms (GMO) implies that new approaches to risk assessment, risk management and risk communication are needed. In this paper we discuss the role of the precautionary principle in policy responses to GMO risk. We first discuss application of the criteria in the European Environment Agency report “Late lessons from early warnings: The precautionary principle 1896–2000” to environmental GMO risk, with focus on crop plants. Moreover, we discuss Bayesian analysis in the context of improving the informational basis for decision‐making under uncertainty. Finally, environmental uncertainties are intertwined with economic uncertainties. Providing incentives for improved risk assessment, risk management and risk communication is crucial for enhancing environmental and social responsibility and thereby facilitate implementation of precautionary approaches. We discuss environmental and social screening of companies as an example of how such incentives can be provided."
gmos,"Despite the government of Canada's close relationship with the biotechnology industry, critical social movement organisations have had a significant impact on the adoption of genetically modified organisms in that country. Two cases of products rejected after widespread resistance – recombinant bovine growth hormone (1999) and herbicide-tolerant Roundup Ready (RR) Wheat (2004) – are revisited. Informed by empirical research that brings to light new factors shaping the RR wheat outcome in particular, two theoretical arguments are advanced. First, in response to those critics of a neo-Gramscian framing of hegemony who see it as overly deterministic, these cases highlight just how deeply alliances with hegemonic ambitions may be forced to compromise. Second, these cases demonstrate that any study of civil society must still pay close attention to institutional and material ‘relations of force’ when seeking to explain the impact of social movements on environmental governance."
gmos,"Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA GMO Panel) compiled its previous risk assessment conclusions and risk management recommendations on the genetically modified insect resistant maize 1507, and considered their validity in the light of new relevant scientific publications published from 2005 onwards. The EFSA GMO Panel performed a search of the scientific literature published between 2005 and September 2012, and identified 61 peer-reviewed publications containing evidence specific to the risk assessment and/or management of maize 1507, of which two were relevant for the food and feed safety assessment, and 34 for the environmental risk assessment and/or risk management. None of these publications reported new information that would invalidate the previous conclusions on the safety of maize 1507 made by the EFSA GMO Panel. Therefore, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that its previous risk assessment conclusions on maize 1507, as well as its previous recommendations on risk mitigation measures and monitoring, remain valid and applicable."

This work deals with the solubilization of selected cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) together with sodium diclofenac (Na-DFC) within the H(II) mesophase for transdermal applications. The effect of CPPs such as RALA (an amphipatic CPP), penetratin (PEN), and oligoarginine (NONA) on Na-DFC skin permeation kinetics to provide controlled release and tune the drug transdermal diffusion was studied. The location of the drug and the CPPs within the mesophase was probed by DSC and FTIR. Na-DFC was found to be located at the interfacial region between the surfactant chains, leading to denser H(II) mesophase. The hydrophilic NONA was intercalated into the aqueous cylinders and caused their swelling. It induced a significant decrease in the hydrogen binding between the GMO carbonyls and their surrounding. The amphiphilic PEN was entrapped within two different regions, depending on its concentration. PEN and NONA improved Na-DFC permeation by 100%, whereas RALA enhanced permeation by 50%. When estimating Na-DFC migration rate out of the mesophase toward surrounding aqueous media, it appeared to be slower with the CPPs. The peptides were not involved at this diffusion-controlled step. It seems that their effect on skin permeation is based on their specific interaction with the skin."
